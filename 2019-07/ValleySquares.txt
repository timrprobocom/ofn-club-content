Summer's here, dress casual, keep cool (we have air conditioning).  Our July 6th dance theme will be "T-shirt Dance", come join us and wear your favorite T-shirt.  Our July 20th dance we will be DARK for Summer Festival, hope to see you there.  
 We had a very fun dance on May 18th, B&B's had an official visitation to us, they retrieved a banner.  Thank you B&B.  Hope to see more clubs visiting this Summer.
