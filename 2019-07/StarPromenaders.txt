The next “Game Night” will be on August 9th. There is a lot going on in the month of July! The theme will be “Sandwich Fixins”. Come out and join us! If you don’t play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on, or if there is some other game you would like to play, let us know. We are open to most any table game. We always have a potluck with a theme.

On Sunday, June 2nd, the Stars sponsored a benefit dance for Alzheimer’s research. I am sure we all know someone who has been affected by this monter. The Stars donated the hall and the callers and cuer from the area donated their time also. Thanks to all who came out to support this event. The chairman of the event revealed to me that she was hoping for around $200 – well, she missed the mark. We actually collected $507 for Alzheimer’s Research!!

Phil Ramey will pick back up the “Back to Basics dance in August.

There were quite a few “Stars” in attendance at the Buckeroo RoundUp. We brought home the award for the most members present from one club!

Preparations for Diamond Lake Festival are coming along nicely. Everything seems to be on schedule. Get your ribbons for a great time.
