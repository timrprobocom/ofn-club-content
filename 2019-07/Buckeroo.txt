June was filled with prep for our annual Buckeroo Round Up. We had Hunter Keller call and Randy Lewis cue for us. We spent three full days dancing and enjoying the company of friends from around the area. Planning has already begun for the 2020 Round Up! Mark your calendar now and plan to join us as we welcome Michael Kellogg to the barn.

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
