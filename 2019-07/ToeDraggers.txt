“It’s a Grand Ol’ Flag” Indeed!
 The Toe’s have been busy with many places to dance and visit.  May 19th a few of us danced at the Oak Grove Community Center to support the Alzheimer’s Association.  Some great baskets were won by the Toe’s and a few yummy cookies too.  On May 26th we had our annual Progressive Dinner.  This year the theme was a murder mystery and we had 3 houses to visit and play out the scenes.  It was a lot of laughs, as some of our amateur actors and others tried to solve this crime.
 On July 5th the Toe’s will host “An American Celebration” dance with Hot dogs and Polish sausage dinner @ 6:30.  This will be followed by Betsy Ross (AKA) Bev Flint cueing, and Yankee Doodle Dandy (AKA) KC Curtis calling.
 Toe’s will be dark July 19th, as many of us will be attending Summer Festival in Salem.
 See you there in a square.
