Our UFO Days dance in May brought visitors from Toe Draggers, Wagon Wheelers, Timber Twirlers, Tualatin Timber Squares, Sunset Promenaders and Swinging Stars. Several people wore costumes. We had a special surprise for Jerry and Bonnie Jepson-their family surprised them by appearing at the dance and bringing a feast for all, including a cake celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary! Some of the family got an introduction to Square Dancing that night, too. We had four squares and lots of fun!

We went back dancing at the McMinnville Grange in June, but will be dark in July and August. Come and join us on the third Saturday in September.  Carmen
