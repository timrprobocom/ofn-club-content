We continue to dance on a couple of Sundays every month at the Emerald Square Dance Center.  Now that Dan Nordbye has returned to Oregon for the summer months we get to dance to his fine calling once a month.  We generally get at least two squares out for both a live caller and recorded tips but sometimes we will only have one square.  Now that the snowbirds are back we hope to see a solid two squares attending our dances.    To see our schedule please go to CAS-SD.yolasite.com.  To make sure we are dancing on a given Sunday, please call (541) 741-4149.  We dance in Hall B behind the square dance center.  To get on the email notification list, contact Fred Beisse at (541) 683-2522.

Hope to see you soon,
