The Hayshakers are happy to report that 66 dancers had a great time dancing for three hours straight at our 67th Anniversary Dance on May 17th. 
 Upcoming dances: Mark Wheeler will call squares on the 3rd Friday in July and Jim Hattrick will call squares and cue rounds on the 3rd Friday in August.  The Hayshakers enjoy dancing â€” no themes necessary.
