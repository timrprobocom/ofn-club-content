In May our first dance was canceled as we combined with Whirl-A-Ways who dance on the second Saturdays to host the annual Mexican Fiesta Dance.  This dance is always well attended with five squares at times on the floor.  Mike Kious called and Christina Corelli cued that night.  A fun night was had by all and of course the taco bar went over very well.  There were visitors from Arizona and Washington State so that made it extra special.  We were pleased to see Clara Fay Anderson back from Arizona and on her feet after a bout of pneumonia.  We were also happy that Vonda Clayton was back dancing with us.

The 4th Friday saw Craig Abercrombie calling and Jackie Gale Cueing to a solid three squares at times.  Craig did a great job calling and choosing fun music for us to dance to.

We are looking forward to our summer dances as we continue to dance throughout the summer 2nd and 4th Friday.  Jim Hattrick calls our 2nd Friday dance and in July we have Lennie Ludiker and in August we have Terry Halley calling our 4th Friday dances.  Jackie Gales cues all our club dances.  If you are looking for some good dancing between the various festivals, please come join u at the Emerald Square Dance Center in Springfield.
