The club is in summer dance mode now, dancing for two hours each Thursday and only taking a few minutes to work a step that still proves to be troublesome.
    
June was our 43rd birthday on the 20th and we had birthday cake and ice cream with multiple toppings. It was fun to see what the dancers brought for selections.
    
David Vomocil will be cueing our June 27 evening of dancing since Stephanie and Leonard will be at Circle 8, learning all sorts of stuff with John and Karen Herr as clinicians. We will gain from what they bring back.

We finished cha and slow two-step lessons and will be putting our heads together in late July or early August to see what is on the minds of the dancers for September lessons. Stay tuned for more news on that. Marilyn Schmit
