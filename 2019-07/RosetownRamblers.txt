The Ramblers prepared for our summer hiatus with a mind-blowing barn burner at our June 8 dance, called by the dazzling Don Wood from Olympia. With the assistance of a set from the scintillating Silver City Squares, a range of raucous Ramblers raised the roof and raked the rafters at the Oak Grove Community Center. The Ramblers customary enthusiasm, combined with the youthful exuberance of our visitors, made a truly memorable occasion. We also welcomed dancers from Chaps & Petticoats and Valley River Dancers. If you’re looking for a good dancing time, you can’t go wrong with the Ramblers.
 
You will have to wait, however, until September 14 for your next opportunity to join the fun. We are dark in July and August. After our summer break, our fall dances will feature:
 
September 14: Kris Jensen
October 12: Richard Lane
November 9: Diana Wedel
December 14: Ian Craig.
 
We dance at the Oak Grove Community Center from 7:30 to 9:30 pm. We alternate Mainstream and Plus tips. We don’t round dance. Every dancer is welcome at the Ramblers.
 
If you can possibly make it to the summer festival, you will be richly rewarded by the fabulous callers scheduled to appear. Featured caller Michael Kellogg has called for our club several times, and he is a master of the craft. We hope to see you in Salem in July.
