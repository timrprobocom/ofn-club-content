Everyone is invited to join us on July 6th for our annual picnic and dance.  We will start with a picnic lunch with sausage dogs, beans, and side salads, and desserts at  5:00 PM. There will be games and some line dancing, then introduction to square dancing for our guests. The dance will start at 7:00 PM with plus for the first half hour. Jim Hattrick will be calling and cueing. This is open to the public, so invite your friends and relatives. Weather permitting, we will be outside on the outdoor dance floor. The dance is $6 and the dinner is $4. Celebrate summer with us!

Dan Nordbye will be calling High Energy Monday Mainstream dances throughout the summer, so check the flyer for the dates.  Donâ€™t miss a chance to dance to this great caller. He challenges our dance skills while keeping it fun. 7 to 9 PM every Monday in July!

Always fun to dance with the Country Cut-Ups! Come join us on 1st and 4th Saturdays, and on 5th Saturdays, if you dance plus level.
