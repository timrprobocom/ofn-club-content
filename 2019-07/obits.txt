<p><img class="right" src="content/2019-07/JosephWhite.jpeg" />Many of you have met Joseph White, who was active in square dancing for years with his wife Cynthia Lamb. Joseph passed away suddenly on February 23. At a recent Corvallis Squares event, Cynthia read this tribute in Joseph&rsquo;s honor. We found it inspiring and want to share it with you.</p>
<p>Who Was Joseph White?</p>
<p>Born October 16, 1944, to Willie Joe White II and Ida May White, they named him Willie Joe White III and nicknamed him JoJo. Both names were ones he never liked nor felt that he fit well into them.&nbsp; As early as age five he became protector and best frind to his little sister, Jennifer, a relationship that remained close for life. His father worked a 300-acre farm near Montgomery, Alabama, which consumed 200% of his time, so his mother raised him. He learned from his dad how to plow a field behind a mule, the meaning of integrity, and always to respect people, ALWAYS, even if THEY don&rsquo;t show respect by cheating you, which happened a lot. This was the deep south, before civil rights. His parents raised seven kids in a house with no running water or electricity or bathrooms. Wood was used for heat and cooking, and it was JoJo&rsquo;s job to fetch the wood and water every morning, rain or shine, as the oldest of seven children, and he faithfully did that without complaints. His semi-educated parents taught him proper etiquette:&nbsp; you drink from only the colored fountain, never burp or fart in public, and never look a white woman in the face on the street, which would get you lynched by the KKK. You always arrive clean and dressed sharp in public; no holey jeans. And the most important thing you could accomplish was an education, which their son took seriously. He won the spelling bee in grade school. He got straight A&rsquo;s and was the teacher&rsquo;s pet. He joined a speech club and went to state championships. He formed the Gentlemen&rsquo;s Club in high school, for boys who wanted to honor and respect girls instead of exploit them. And he graduated valedictorian of his class with a 4H Safety scholarship to Tuskegee University. He could have gone earlier; at 16 he passed the college entrance exams and wanted to enroll immediately. His parents wouldn&rsquo;t let him. Coloreds that excelled too much and stood out made whites look bad so the KKK took care of that, too. JoJo was forced to wait till he was 18, normal college age. But once at Tuskegee he excelled there too. He became class president, changed his major from Mechanical Engineering (an aspiration for which he was accused of being an uppity n-----r) to the school of Business, and joined ROTC. Upon receiving his B. A. in business management, he became an officer in the Air Force. He was about to graduate in the top three of his class as a fighter jet pilot when he found out where they were about to send them, to Vietnam to bomb cities full of civilians. He expressed that that was not why he joined the Air Force. When he objected, instead of discharging him for disobeying orders, they honored his reasons and gave him an alternate assignment. As squadron commander he turned the &ldquo;dregs and dropout&rdquo; recruits into top performers, and received awards for his leadership skills. He loved his time in the service and was about to re-up as a lifer when the war in Vietnam wound down and fewer officers were needed. Captain White was offered an early out with full benefits. He took it.</p>
<p>When he was 14, he had made a bold statement: &ldquo;When I am old enough, I shall leave the South and I shall never return.&rdquo; After changing his name to William Joseph White, a name that he felt fit him better, he moved to the Northwest, never to return. William means &ldquo;the protector.&rdquo; He was called Joseph; the same name as the protector of Mary and the young Jesus. His middle years were spent in public service, both state and federal. At the Oregon Department of Transportation, he acted as a facilitator, bringing &ldquo;warring factions&rdquo; together so they could more efficiently and effectively construct our transportation infrastructure. As an Employment Specialist for Oregon Employment Department he made sure that employers found the right person for every job&mdash;no &ldquo;square pegs&rdquo; were ever stuffed into &ldquo;round holes.&rdquo; He held the record for the most employees that stuck to their jobs for good. Whenever Joseph and I went downtown or grocery shopping, there was always somebody who wanted to shake his hand or hug him and thank him, and tell the story of how he had totally changed their life by finding out who they were and what they needed to progress in career and in life. I just watched in awe.</p>
<p>Joseph didn&rsquo;t marry until he was 35, but finding Bonnie at Multnomah School of the Bible in 1979 led to having his two very adored daughters, Sarrha and Esther, who each bore him three grandchildren. Bonnie and Joseph homeschooled their kids and instilled the importance of education in each of them too, and they were straight A students.</p>
<p>I met Joseph at OSU at a lecture series entitled The Evolution of Human Spirituality, in a phase of life where I was nearly spiritually dead. Joseph awakened me to realms I never knew existed, and we spent countless hours sipping coffee and discussing the meaning of words, events, and the teachings of many spiritual gurus. Never a boring word came from his mouth. He taught me to value myself and believe in my own power to become who I really wanted to be, and that we are all capable of creating our own reality.</p>
<p>If I can sum up what Joseph&rsquo;s life was about, it is:&nbsp; Dare to dream big. Never give up on achieving your dream. Discover who you are, what you came to do, and do it. Along the way you&rsquo;ll discover what you love to do and what you&rsquo;re really good at. When you do, share it with as many people as you can. Give the world the absolute best you&rsquo;ve got. Be aware that some people will try to kick you in the teeth and put you down for it. But give the world the best you&rsquo;ve got anyway.</p>
<p>In Joseph&rsquo;s last moments he carried a box of meat in the rain to the car for me. He didn&rsquo;t feel up to driving, and as I was driving us to the grocery store to buy the rest of the goodies for our Corvallis Squares birthday dance, his last words were, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m losing consciousness.&rdquo; He died as he lived, serving others, uncomplainingly.</p>
