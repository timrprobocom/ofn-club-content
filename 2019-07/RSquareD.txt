May was a one dance month due to Memorial Day holiday but it was a busy club month.  We finished our Plus workshops, and the attendees were so eager that we decided to continue in the fall.  Watch for that announcement.
Did you see us on KGW TV, with Rod Hill?  5 couples were available at 6:30 am to go to the Red Leaf Coffee Shop for a demo.  It was fun and several dancers had people comment to them that they had seen the spot on TV!  Memorial Day weekend was the 50th anniversary for Ron and Lynn Waliezer.  It is such an honor to celebrate this fun couple's long term marriage.
 May is when our new president couple begins.  Outgoing Vic Roberts and Toni Carroll were recognized and appreciated with flowers as was secretary Chris Poole and Treasurer Pat Faires by our incoming President couple Dick and Sandy Sims.  These offices are the foundation of our clubs, many behind the scenes hours and for the most part unrecognized efforts keep our club successful.  Thank you to each of those willing to serve.
 July 24th will be a 2:30-3:30 demo at the Cowlitz County fair called by Jim Raupp.  Jim will also call our Hawaiian theme dance that evening.
 Our summer dances are ice cream themed treats and casual attire, air conditioned hall...great fun ahead for our summer dances.  See you there.
 Summer news and info will be on our website: www.r-square-d.info  2nd and 4th Wednesday.  Dance times:  7pm - 8pm Plus with advanced rounds, 8pm - 9:30pm Mainstream with rounds.  106 NW 8th Ave, Kelso, WA 98626 by the Rotary spray park at the intersection of Hwy 4 and W Main, Kelso/Longview. 
 Happy summer to all,
