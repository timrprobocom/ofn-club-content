It will be a mixed bag for the Columbia River Dancers this summer (July and August). The club has decided to go dark for Saturday night dances BUT, will be having lessons on Tuesday evenings.
 We will have new dancers at 7 PM and mainstream lessons at 8:30. So, if you would like to keep current on your mainstream or know those who would like to learn, the Hazel Dell Grange is the place to be this summer. Our caller, Jim Hattrick, will also be reviewing round dancing beginning at 5:30.
 The only thing that will interfere with the above schedule is when the temperature gets above 90 at 5:30. It is then that the Grange is just too warm to dance.
 The Columbia River dancers would like to throw out a big “Thank You” to all of those dancers who have supported us this year. So, instead of holding dances the club has decided we will be returning the favor and visiting clubs who have supported us. We will be looking to not only get our banners back but hope to add to our collection.
 See you in a square soon. Have a great summer!
