Our Plus classes finished the end of May.  Remember how nervous you were when you first attended a different club. Be supportive of these new and enthusiastic dancers.
 We want to thank our club and everyone that helped with baskets and attended to make the Alzheimer’s benefit dance a great success. There were 79 signed-in dancers and a grand total of $1,529 was raised for the Alzheimer’s Association.  
 Our newly elected officers are busy learning their new duties and planning for the next year’s events.  Other volunteers are needed for the little jobs that take a few hours or more depending on the job at hand. As my grandmother used to say, “Many hands make light work.” For the good of the order lend a helping hand. 
 Get ready for Summer Festival in Salem July 19th - 21st.  You will meet old friends, make new friends, and enjoy a mini vacation. Go find that someone in your club who would be thrilled to sell you ribbons.  Next it will be our turn, along with Hoedowners to put in the work for Summer Festival 2020 in Seaside, OR.
 Have a safe and sane July Forth celebration and observance.  After all it is Independence Day when we should reflect on how we started and how we have changed over time. 
 We dance on most holidays. Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 p.m. - 3:00, at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Portland.  Please check for up to date information at www.EagerBeavers.info.
