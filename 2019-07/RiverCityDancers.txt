River City Dancers dance all year long, every second and third Saturday . Having said that, July we are making an exception. We will be having our usual dance on Saturday July 13, but will be dark on our second dance July 20 to attend Summer festival in Salem. 

The rest of the summer and all year, we will be dancing every second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community Center. Our hall is air conditioned for your comfort.  Come visit us. We welcome everyone and love visitors.
