Golden Squares here! I hope you can all make it to our 5th Monday Pie Night on July 29.  We always have plenty of homemade pies so you can have two pieces if you want.

We are having our pajama dance on the first Monday in August. Julie Stiers is our cuer on the first and fifth Mondays and Sherri Clark cues on the third Monday. We could really use some visitors. We have a great dance hall with air conditioning. Please keep us in mind this summer. Golden Squares will be dark on August 19. Teija Danskey
