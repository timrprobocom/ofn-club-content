Our board remains the same as last year.  David Lajoie - President, Kurt Jensen - Vice-President, Lorna Mercer - Treasurer, Cheryl Hagey - Secretary and Christina Corelli - Member-at-Large.  Thank you all for being willing to keep your offices.

We dance almost every Sunday at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.  5:30 - 8:00.  We dance all levels.  Our caller, Tim Matteson, will adjust the levels according to who shows up to come and dance.  It's always FUN, and we always have a lot of FOOD!  We encourage all square dancers to join us!  The floor is cushioned and comfortable! We even have heat and air conditioning!

Please call Tim at 541-988-0399 or David at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are dancing.  We are dark once in a blue moon, but we'd hate to miss you. 

Keep on dancing,
Christina Corelli
