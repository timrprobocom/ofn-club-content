The clubs are moving along with finishing classes.  Charlie Browns are having a fast track class that should be complete in July.

The council is sponsoring a Benefit Challenge weekend in August: Raise the Roof for Beachcombers.  Star Promenaders are donating the dance hall for the weekend, the callers and cuers are volunteering their time, and the council will be putting on a fantastic dance with dancing in the water.  All proceeds will go to the Beachcombers to help put a new roof on their dance hall.

July 12 is the Youth dance for ALL ages will be July 12, 6-8pm at Fruitdale Grange in Grants Pass.  If an experienced dancer brings a non-dancer, both get in free.

Respectfully,
Lorri Jo McIntosh
Rogue Sis Q Council Secretary
