Happy Summer Greetings from the Salem Swingin' Stars. We dance ALL summer long in our air conditioned hall, so please come join the fun.

By the time you read this we will have had two demo dances as well as our regular dances in June. The World Beat Festival has invited us back to dance on Sunday June 30 at 12:00 pm.  Location is Salem Waterfront Park.  If you are in the area, come on over to join in.

We will be DARK on July 1 as we will all be at Blanchet School for Summer Festival.  We will see you on the dance Floor. Sheila Machado
