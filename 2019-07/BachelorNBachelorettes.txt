Just a reminder that as a club policy, we dance each Wednesday that the temperature is higher than 32 or lower than 90.

Our big summer project is that we are going to have a “Get Tim and Kathy Roberts Here Dance”.  Why Tim and Kathy?  They are the closest proximal Federation officer to our club at the Abernethy Grange; yet no one can recall just when they last visited our club.  I guess the first thing we do is to ask any readers if they know how to get the Roberts to come to our dance?

Wouldn’t it be great to get them here for (maybe) our Christmas in July Dance on July 31?  I’ve talked to our President about a reception line.  I wanted to be in the front of the line, but President said, “No because your dues are in arrears.”

We’re all aflutter with the thought of them coming, maybe July 31.  Our parking valet (Parker Parkit) says he won’t even insist on a tip to park their car.  Club chef (Cal Amari) says he will create something special and unforgettable.  Club decorator (Dorcas Décor) says she’s ready for even a surprise visit.  Music Directors KC Curtis and Tami Helms will also be ready July 31.  Or maybe Tim and Kathy will make a surprise visit this Wednesday?
