Greetings from Yreka.

    As always there are so many people to thank, but on the heels of Memorial Day and the 75th anniversary of D-Day, I don't think I can ever say enough thanks to all of the men and women who serve in our military that make this the greatest country in the world.

    Let me say a big thank you to every one that attended our Armed Forces dance. I had a great time dancing and calling and working on a few Advanced calls. As always it's a different feel calling and dancing at the same time. 

    By the time you read this we will have held our Gold Diggers Dance. So a belated thank you to every one who attended.  We look forward to our Birthday dance with Eric and Rikki. I hope you have all circled Sept 21 on your calendars. Look for fliers with the location and a special prize.

      As summer approaches we may have an opportunity to dance thru the summer and work with the Karuk Indian tribe.  

      I want to welcome Debbie back. I also want to say a couple special thank yous! A great big thank you to Bogey for all the shirts! I'm sure I could dance every night for a month and not wear the same  shirt, so again thank you! I also want to thank Phil and the Star Promenaders  for inviting me to call for them. 

Hope to see you on the floor
Dean
