Greetings from the Buzzin' Bees.  We had our last dance of the season on June 1st and we are dark for the summer because we are not blessed with an air conditioned hall. We had a club meeting before our last dance and have a great plan for themed dances in the next dance year. 

Our summer plans include a club picnic at K.C. & Linda's house on 7/28. Linda and KC will provide the meat and club members should bring salads and desserts.  

We plan to resume dancing on September 21st at the Hazel Dell Grange with KC Curtis as our caller and Lonnie Sykes as our cuer.  Lessons will start Sunday 9/15 and we are discussing starting at 4pm. 

The Bees hope you have a great summer.
