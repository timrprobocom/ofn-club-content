Our next CCCA dance is June 29 at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield. We'll have a meeting at 6:30.  The dance will begin at 7:30 with Pre-Rounds.  The square dance goes from 8:00 - 10:00.  Please join us!

We are so sorry to inform you that one of our caller members, Larry DuPray (Wolf Pack) passed away recently.  Larry had heart surgery and was feeling better and looking better as well.  He was slated to go back to work (BLM) but didn't make it that first day back.  One of the Wolf Pack members went to Larry's home and found him.  A memorial picnic and gathering will be held at Island Park, the south shelter in Springfield on August 17 from 10:00 A.M.  to 2:00 P.M This was supposed to be our annual picnic, but the decision was made to honor Larry in the atmosphere of fun and camaraderie.  Larry started the Wolf Pack back in 1998 on Valentine's Day.  Because of his health he had not been able to call the past year or so.  Sandy Harris and Lennie Ludiker have been calling.  Christina remains cuer.  Please attend if you are able.  It is wheelchair accessible. My late husband, Kirby Goode, helped Larry with his calling when he first started.  We miss them both.  Sharon Greenman cued for the Wolf Pack as well and is sorely missed.

Our next scheduled dance is August 31 which is also my birthday.  Which one you ask?  Hmm.

That is also close to Labor Day, but I will let you know if we are going to dance. 

We have meetings and dances on the fifth Saturdays of each year.   Our board remains the same as last year.  Pat Cox - President, Jackie Gale, - Vice-President, Gail Jackson - Treasurer and Christina Corelli - Secretary.

Keep on calling and cueing for fun,
Christina Corelli
CCCA Secretary
