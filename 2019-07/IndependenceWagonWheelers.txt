Summer dancing continues in full swing. Our IWW first Saturday dance on July 6 at the Polk County Fairgrounds will be a Patriotic Red, White, and Blue Dance. Dress in your red, white, and blue finery and come help us celebrate the joy of square dancing and the birthday of our wonderful United States. 

Then continue to dance with us at the Fairgrounds on the first and second Saturdays of each month (except we are dark in August).  We are looking forward to gathering with dancers from neighboring clubs at Blanchet Catholic School in Salem July 19, 20, and 21 for Summer Festival.

During July, IWW will collect cans of decaffeinated coffee to contribute to Windsor House, an annual service project for the club. Then August 8-10 we will brave the summer heat to staff the admission gates at the Polk County Fair, our annual club fund-raising project.

Encourage friends, family, and work associates to join us for mainstream lessons at Salem Hospital beginning in September. Keep dancing!  Dee and Bert Mackaman
