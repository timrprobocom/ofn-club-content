In May we drove out to visit the Country Cut-Ups in the beautiful countryside near Mt. Hood.  Also all our members were encouraged to visit the Pacific Northwest Teen Festival and the Alzheimer's Benefit Dance. 
 Although we’re dark in July and August, we’ve planned two visitation each month.  In July they will be to the Bachelor & Bachelorettes on Wednesday the 10th, and then to the Valley River Dancers on Friday the 26th for their “Under the Stars” dance which has made itself a part of Newberg’s Old Fashioned Days Festival.
