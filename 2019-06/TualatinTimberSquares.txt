Wow! We had a PARTY at our 3rd Anniversary on April 24!  Although the number of dancers there was relatively small (almost 3 squares), the energy levels were high. Club Caller Janienne Alexander and Club Cuer Sherri Clark kept all of us on our toes and dancing all night.  We had visitors from the Toe Draggers, Valley Squares, Sunset Promenaders, Hoedowners, Wavesteppers, and a few more areas.  After the dance, we all enjoyed a Nacho Bar, along with a special Anniversary Cake and ice cream downstairs.  We all had a GREAT time!!!
 Our dances in June are on the 12th and on the 26th.  A reminder: if we have less than a square at any of our dances, we may end the dance early or cancel the dance.
 Also, summer is coming, and, if the temperature on the day of the dance reaches 90 degrees or above, we may cancel the dance.  If this happens, we will let everyone know.
 Our club continues to be a fun place where friends gather, have some food and practice moves they want to work on before the weekend dances.  Lots of belly laughs to go around.  We would love to have you come join us!
 See you around in a square.
