We’re enjoying the start of another great year of dancing under the leadership of our new President Terry McCarty and Vice-President Eugene Ivy, who assumed the reins at our Transitional Board Meeting on May 4. We will continue encouraging friends, family, and co-workers to join us for Mainstream Lessons at Salem Hospital in September, coordinated by this year’s Good Scout and Membership Chair Dave (and Teresa) O’Neill  – details to follow. Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays of each month at Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall.  We will be dark in August. Dee and Bert Mackaman
