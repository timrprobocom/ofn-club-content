Our April showers dance was a bit quiet.  I should take that back.  Our dancers never have fun quietly.  It was just quiet-er since there were fewer squares.  It was really quiet on April 27th dance as we were dark in support of Salty Sashayers and Yakima Sashay.
 We have had great response for the Plus workshop on Wednesday evenings.  I just wanna say "it takes a community" and we really appreciate and enjoy the interaction we have from so many of you.  As the square dance world changes around us we are drawing together all the more.  It is wonderful to have friends like you.
 Remember what happens in June, summertime?  We go to a different dance schedule.  Times are the same but we dance on 2nd and 4th Wednesdays.
 Summertime starts our ice cream-for-treats.  On the 12th it will be strawberries and ice cream, on the 26th it will be ice cream floats for the Out to the Ballgame theme.  What will Craig and Lonnie bring us for dancing?  Come and see.  Summer dances are casual so when your day winds down come dance with us.  Summer news and info will be on our website, www.r-square-d.info.  June begins summer dance schedule: 2nd and 4th Wednesday.  Dance times:  7pm - 8pm Plus with advanced rounds, 8pm - 9:30pm Mainstream with rounds.  106 NW 8th Ave, Kelso, WA 98626 by the Rotary spray park at the intersection of Hwy 4 and W Main, Kelso/Longview. 
 Happy summer to all,
