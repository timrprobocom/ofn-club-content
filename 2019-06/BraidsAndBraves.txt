In April, our club visited Albany Timber Twirlers and Willamette Squares. We know that visiting other clubs is essential to keep the recreation we love alive. For our April Dance, Dan Nordbye was our guest caller and we had lots of visitors!

At our May dance, the family of Jerry and Bonnie Jepson surprised them with a celebration of their 50th Wedding Anniversary. Some of the group also square danced and we all enjoyed the celebration/ 

May was our last dance at Dayton Community Center because in June we'll be back dancing at the McMinnville Grange on Old Sheridan Road. We start at 7 pm. All visitors are warmly welcomed! We will be dark in July and August, but we are looking forward to a campout with the Toedraggers in July. Carmen
