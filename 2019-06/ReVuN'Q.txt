The club continued on with slow two-step and cha lessons until the end of May. June finds a schedule change to dance from 6:30-8:30 p.m. through the end of August. That will give everyone time to enjoy some of the daylight and summer hours.
June 20 is our 43rd birthday dance with two hours of Phase 2-4 dancing. Cuers are still being worked on, so stay tuned to Facebook to find out who is cueing the dance. We will have a guest cuer on June 27 since Stephanie and Leonard will be at Circle 8 for a round dance workshop seminar. We are looking forward to dancing to new music when they return.
We are always open to visitors to dance and join in on our relaxed version of a club. If you have any questions, give me a call 503-508-0539. Marilyn Schmit
