Hi Everyone

On May 4th & 5th, the State Federation Meeting was in our council. The “Crock Pot” Potluck was held at the Rogue Valley Square Dance Center on Table Rock Rd. There were lots of good words and “Thank You’s” from those who attended about the food. There was certainly plenty and, as usual, this Council did a bang-up job of preparing it. We sure do have a bunch of “Top Notch” cooks in Southern Oregon. Way to go, Gang!! The May 5th meetings was held at the Square Dance Center on Sunday.

There will be a Council Dance on May 31, 2019 in Grants Pass at the Josephine County Square Dance Center. Caller is Chuck Simpkins and cuer is Bob Dingman.

The next Council meeting will be June 4th, 2019 at Round Table Pizza in Poplar Square.
