Our last dance of the season was our May dance. We had a pasta smorgasbord dinner before the dance. Thank you to everyone who came out to enjoy the dinner and dance to Leonard Snodgrass and Judy Russell. Judy filled in for Frances and Floyd who were out of town.

There has been a lot of expressed interest so we will be trying to do summer lessons again this year. Thomas Buchheit will be our instructor for the summer.

Our youth will be running the concession stand at Summer Festival this July. This will be a fundraiser for competition so please check us out and buy a festival pin for 2020. We will be traveling to Auburn, Washington for the festival next year.

This year's teen festival went very well. We had a lot of fun throughout the Festival. Five of our youth led the National Anthem at the start of Saturday: Lucy David, Jasmine Mauro, Noah Rudolph, Phoebe Rudolph and Kailee Shields. We had successes and some goofs. We came home with a lot of trophies: Jasmine Mauro won 1st place in Pre-Teen Novice Cueing; Petrina Buchheit won Best Patter for Junior Calling and 3rd place Junior Calling; Yesenia Vallejo-Mourer won 2nd place Junior Calling; Julia Buchheit won 2nd place Junior Cueing; Petrina and Julia Buchheit won 2nd place Basic Rounds; Silver Dragons won 2nd place in Senior Squares. Both Julia and Thomas Buchheit helped out Wesburn Wranglers in their Intermediate Square when their callers were on the stage. We will have our trophies at Summer Festival so please stop by and take a look. Hope to see you at a dance soon! Petrina Buchheit
