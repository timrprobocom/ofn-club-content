At the quarterly meeting of Willamette Squares, among the topics was a discussion of the future of our club. At our monthly dance, which was our Maypole dance, we wove in and out making a colorful pattern with the ribbons. We get better at it each year! We had a good turnout and a good time! Jodee Howard
