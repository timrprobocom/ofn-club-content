 Regular readers of this column will notice that the Naven name does not appear for the first time in years.  Dick and Sue have been invaluable members for many years.  Each has served as officers time and time again.  Dick set up our website and designed our posters.  He has also been the liaison with the Winona Grange.  As a member of the grange, he has been responsible for many improvements.  After so many years of dedicated and invaluable service, they are stepping back a little.  We hope to see them on the dance floor as often as possible.  We thank them for all that they have gone for the clubs, and I personally thank them for all the times they have provided transportation for me to and from the dances.
