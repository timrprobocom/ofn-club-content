June weddings and June dances, lots of fun things to do this month.
 Toe’s had a hoppin’ good time at our last dance in April. 
 The Ham dinner and bazaar fund raiser our grange put on was a mild success.  With the help of our square dance friends and the Scholls community’s generous donations, we will be able to keep the building alive and healthy. Thank you all so much!
 Our next fun fund raiser is the Kinton Grange annual Rummage Sale, Friday and Saturday June 14th & 15th, 9:00am-3:00pm.  Tons of Treasures and a Plant sale too. 
 We are looking forward to the June 7th dance, it will be “Rocking thru the Ages” all singing calls with music from the 50’s to the 80’s.  It should be a rockin’ good time, so come on over to the Kinton Grange and Rock ON!!
 We hope to see you all real soon.
