In May our club enjoyed a visitation to Sunset Promenaders for their Cinco De Mayo dance. It was a fun celebration and we enjoyed feasting on Mexican snacks at break time. We enjoy attending club visitations and also hosting visitations from other clubs that come to visit us.  Please give us a call if you are bringing a visitation so we can role out the “red carpet” to greet you. We love visitors.

We are celebrating our club anniversary at our dance on June 8. We invite all dancers to come help us celebrate. Darrell Kalmbach and Tami Helm (our caller and cuer) will add to your dancing pleasure . We have our second monthly dance the following Saturday on June 15. Both dances are located at Milwaukie Community Center at 42nd and Jackson in Milwaukie Oregon.

Our club will be going dark on our second dance in July on Saturday July 20 to attend summer festival. You can still dance with us though if you come to summer festival. Look for us.  We will be there in our blue and white club outfits
