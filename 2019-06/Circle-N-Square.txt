We are gearing up for our Gold Diggers dance with Lawrence Johnstone calling and Sarge N Cece cuing rounds. As a reminder the dance will be June 22 (4th Saturday) and held at Evergreen Elementary School. Please look for fliers. Also look for tickets for the custom necklace you do not have to be present to win. We will draw the winning ticket at the dance. I want to thank the visitors that attended our April dance, it always nice to see friends and catch up. Our Easter Bonnet theme was lots of fun and everyone got into the spirit. As usual our dances may be small but our fellowship is large. As a club we have a lot things on our plate, after Gold Diggers we will begin gearing up for our major fund raiser. Each year we have a booth at the county fair. We are always looking for volunteers to help. If you would like to volunteer or want more info, feel free to contact us. After the fair we begin prepping for our Birthday dance with Eric Henerlau. and Rikki Lobato There will be another special drawing at this dance too. So as you can see we are still very active. 
We welcome any and all dancers. 

Hope to see you on the floor.
