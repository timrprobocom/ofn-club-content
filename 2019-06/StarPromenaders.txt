The “Game Night” on May 10th was a great time. If you don’t play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage or let us know if there is some other game you would like to play. The next “Game Night” will most likely be in July – possibly on July 5th. Stay tuned.

Don’t forget – On Sunday, June 2nd, the Stars are sponsoring a benefit dance for Alzheimer’s research. The time will be 2 to 5pm. Please come out to support this very worthy cause. Help us find a cure, or at least a way to slow this terrible disease down. I am sure we all know someone who has been affected by this monster. Come on down and help! The Stars are donating the hall and the callers and cuers from the area are going to donate their time also.

Phil Ramey is having a “Back to Basics” on the 3rd Friday of each month, with the exception of July. This is due to Summer Festival and Diamond Lake. We will pick it back up in August and go from there.

Elections are over and the only change to the Stars roster is President. Mary Moody decided to step down after 4 years and give someone else a chance. Phil Claudson is our “#One” now.

Preparations for Diamond Lake Festival are coming along nicely. Everything seems to be on schedule. Get your ribbons for a great time.

See you in a square!
