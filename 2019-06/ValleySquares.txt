Our Anniversary dance on  April 20th was a great success.  There were 94 dancers in attendance.  Thank you everyone for helping us celebrate 70 years.  
 Valley Squares June 1st dance is "June Bug Boogie" with Scott Zinser calling and Connie Clark cueing.  Come join us for a lively dance.  
 Our students will be graduating on June 11th.  I will miss having classes, they are so much fun.  
 Our June 15th dance is our "Strawberry Dance" where we have the new board take over.  Craig Abercrombie is calling and Connie Clark cueing.  Come enjoy strawberries and cream and shortcake and maybe ice cream.  We all look forward to the strawberry dance.  What Fun!  Yum!
 Our dance schedule will be 7 to 8:30 pm, Mainstream at class level until graduation, then full Mainstream,  8:30 to 9;30-ish pm, Plus.  We include the "ish" as we don't know when we will stop, all dancers help make that decision.
 See you in a square.  Yellowrock!
