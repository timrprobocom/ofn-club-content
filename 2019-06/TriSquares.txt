In April we visited the Valley Squares for their 70th anniversary dance, and we had our annual general meeting and election of officers.  
 Our new officers for May 2019 - April 2020 are: President Dale Brabham, Vice President Alice Hendricks, Secretary Gloria Davis, Treasurer Edith Prouty, Dance Coordinator Lynnea Loveberg, TVC Delegate #1 Judy Groom, and TVC Delegate #2 Deb Mandeville.
 In June we look forward to our last two dances of this dance-year, June 8th “Summer Dreamin” and June 28th “Berry Best Ice Cream Special”, both with our caller Terry Halley and cuer Sandra Pinion.  We also plan to visit the Chaps and Petticoats for their June 21st  “50’s-60’s Dance.”
