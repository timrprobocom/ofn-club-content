June will bring lots of dancing at the Barn! We will dance 1st, 4th, and 5th Saturdays. In addition, we will be hosting Dan Nordbye on Monday nights for the High Energy Mainstream dances from 7-9 PM. Check the flyer for the schedule. On Fatherâ€™s Day, we will be hosting a special dance with Adam Christman calling and cueing.  Look for our flyer for the details.  The 5th Saturday dance will be all plus and Craig Abercrombie will be calling and cueing for that.
June may bring some outdoor dance floor weather, too. Come and dance under the stars on hot summer nights and feel the gentle outdoor breezes to cool you off.

Want to diversify your dance skills? Come join us for line dance lessons with Lynn Wunische on Wednesday afternoon 2:30 PM or Thursdays at 6:00 PM. Or learn more by coming for both! 

The Cut-Ups are great dancers and lots of fun, so take the drive out into the countryside and join us at the Boring Barn!
