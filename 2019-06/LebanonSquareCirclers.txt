As usual, the Lebanon Square Circlers club is very busy. The last weekend in April, many of our members went to Camp Koinonia in Sweet Home. A great time was had by all and the weather was perfect. May 4 was our Cinco de Mayo dance with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing. There were three squares on the floor and tacos were served at the break -- thanks to Bill Jeskey (the super chef). 

IT'S STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL TIME! Events begin on Friday, May 31, with a Spaghetti Feed and then the Trails End dance with callers and cuers from the floor. On Saturday, June 1, the club participates in the Lebanon Strawberry Festival parade, dancing through town on the decorated float. A potluck at 5:30 PM will be followed by the big Festival dance with Dan Nordbye calling and Jackie Gale cueing. Strawberry shortcake, of course, will be served at the break time. Special features of our weekend will be a great Silent Auction, which is our annual fund raiser, an Experienced Clothing Sale, lots of prizes, and wonderful dancing. The weekend will conclude with an "All You Can Eat" breakfast on Sunday morning. RVs are welcome with dry camping.  Don't miss this fantastic weekend! See you in a square! Marilyn York
