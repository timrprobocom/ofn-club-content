Summer will soon be upon us.  As a reminder, we try to dance all summer, but we don’t dance if the temperature reaches 90.  Our twin air conditioners can’t keep up.

We’ve picked up a few members here and there – in spite of the fact I give my disclaimer that I wouldn’t join a club that would have a person like me as a member!  Remember: to err is human, but it feels divine!

Come on over and find what we’re all about; come on over and sashay with us.
