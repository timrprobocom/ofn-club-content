The very best news we have is that our VP Ken Schrock is home after hip surgery and doing very well.  He might even be able to come to our dance  this week.  We are all cheering you on Ken and wish you well.
We have a change in our schedule and find we have to be DARK on July 5.  Please make that change.    Also in the last part of July we are looking forward to celebrating our Anniversary.

We want to welcome present and former senior (meaning older) square dancers to our dances.  We have a great dance hall with air conditioning, wonderful callers ,and a potluck lunch after.  It is great exercise, social and fun..  We love our seniors so please come help us stay strong.
