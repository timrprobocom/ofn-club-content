Our Spring dances have been a lot of fun! Our last dance for this season will be June 8, and then we're dark till the second Saturday in September. We hope to have a few demo dances in the summer to get the word out about square dancing and how enjoyable it is! 

By the time this appears in the OFN, we will have had our May potluck and membership meeting, where the conversation was about officers for next year and plans for offering lessons in the fall. Our dance calendar is already set up and weâ€™ll continue to dance on the second and fourth Saturdays of the month next year. Karen
