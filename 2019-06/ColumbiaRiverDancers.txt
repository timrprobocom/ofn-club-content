At our annual meeting in April The Columbia River Dancers decided that we will go dark at our dances in July and August. We will, however, continue with our lessons.  Without air conditioning the grange was just too hot too often last year.  We also found that when the temperatures go up dance attendance goes down.
 Because we are dark does not mean the CRDâ€™s will not be dancing.  We have club banners out there in the square dance world so will be planning on visitations to get them back.  We want to repay all of those clubs who have been faithful and attend our dances.  This is the way it should be, so look for us.
 As many local clubs besides ours goes dark the club did decide to continue with lessons on Tuesday nights.  The area has many newer, and lots of older, dancers who want to continue learning or honing their skills so it was decided that we could help by keeping our lessons going.  Who else can hone skills like our caller, Jim Hattrick.  Plan on coming to lessons on Tuesday nights unless it is 90 degrees at 5 PM.  Jim will call to the level of the floor and there will lots of angels to help.  Newer dancers at 7 PM and mainstream and up about 8:30.
 Our June 8th dance will feature Mike and Julie Stout calling and cueing.  Our June 22nd dance will have a patriotic theme so wear the red, white and blue.  Jim will be doing the calling and cueing.
 We look forward to seeing you soon.
