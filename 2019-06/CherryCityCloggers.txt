Cherry City Cloggers continue to work on polishing our demo dances for our upcoming demo season which will be starting this month. Our first one will be at World Beat at Riverfront Park on Sunday June 30 from 2:45-3:30 p.m. We also continue to dance and do demos each week all summer long. We have no dark times unless our Tuesday night happens to fall on a holiday. 

Some of our members attended a workshop in Vancouver a month or so ago in Vancouver called "Clog Down". In the evening session they had a competition called "Clog Down". One song that the instructor had taught and practiced throughout the day was chosen for this competition. Each participant continued to dance that song until he/she made a mistake and was eliminated and only one dancer remained on the dance floor. I'm excited to say that our own instructor Staci Larson won that competition. Congratulations Staci!!  Georganne
