Spring at the barn has found us busy cleaning and preparing for our annual Buckeroo Round Up. The theme this year will be 1950’s and we are busy decorating the barn and getting ready to host dancers from all over Oregon. We have some changes this year that we are excited about. There will be contests, meals, and LOTS more dancing. Check out our flyer and plan now to join the fun!

This past month we had a visitation to the Wolf Pack dance in Eugene. We carpooled together and ended up with a nice group attending. We all got a dangle to add to our collection when it was time to go. We have been invited to help the Saint’s and Aint’s celebrate their birthday, so we may take another road trip. We love supporting other clubs and helping to get our new dancers exposed to the many talented callers around the area.

We had a great 5th Saturday dance here at the barn. We teamed up with the DC Line Dancers and had a great party. It was fun to share our love of square dancing with them, and to get to try line dancing. We are enjoying the partnership we are building with members of our community.

Lessons and workshops are moving forward and going well for us. Our current group of students are moving along quite well and we are looking forward to seeing them out on the dance floor.

Remember that we are only a short drive on I5 from both Portland and Medford.  We would love to see you at the barn!

Keep dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
