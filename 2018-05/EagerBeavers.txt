On Memorial Day, May 28th, we will dance at the Aloha Grange at 185th and TV Highway, not Sunset Presbyterian Church.  So, this is a good day to join our dance if you have the day off.  By this time all our new students will be ready to do all the plus moves so this will be an excellent dance for those of us who enjoy plus. 
 We started our plus classes in February and I have been amazed at how quickly our students have progressed.  There are times when you cannot tell the students from the members and I think I might be one of those.  Lessons are continuing until the end of May with workshops through June. 
 Remember Mother’s Day, May 13th.  If you happen to be a mother look in the mirror and say,  “I did the best I could with the information I had at the time.”  Rules of parenting have changed quite a bit in the last fifty years and I am speaking from personal experience.  I also ignored a lot of my mother’s advice.
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons,  "Plus Brush Up" noon to 1:15 and our regular dance is 1:15 to 3:00 pm, at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
