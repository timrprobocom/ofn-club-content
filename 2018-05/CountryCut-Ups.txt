We want to give a big thanks to all who attended our Murder Mystery Play, “Who blew Up the Outhouse?”  We deemed the event a big success as we raised over $1200 for our outdoor floor and everyone seemed to have a good time!  We especially want to thank the crew that participated in the play and put in a lot of hours and effort to bring it to pass. We hope you will all come out and enjoy the floor this summer as we dance under the stars and enjoy the breeze!

May brings our Mystery Trip and we are already sold out for the bus ride. We are combining with the Oaky Doaks this year for double the fun. We haven’t yet been able to find out where we are going, but we are sure we will have a good time getting there and dancing once we arrive!

Our Plus lessons will be finishing up at the end of the month under Scott Zinser’s able tutelage. The students are learning quickly and we are happy to have them graduate in time to come to our all plus level dance at the end of June.  We are having some mainstream FunShops on Mondays through the summer with Dan Nordbye. Check out the flyer on the OFN for the exact dates.

We have a lot of fun dancing at the Boring Barn, because we take being Cut-Ups seriously!
