Over the river and through the woods to Boring Barn we go.  Well, at least over the river to a visitation to Country Cut-Ups.  As with the visitations to other clubs, we had a wonderful time with delightful people who extended great hospitality.  Some of the hosting dancers were dressed up for the occasion, including one in a chicken costume and two with glow lights.  Glow light bunny ears I hadn't seen before.  We did earn our banner back, and we ate an outstanding potluck dinner.  Altogether, a delightful evening.
 Shifting the scene back to Winona Grange, it seems like old times with about five squares for Randy's lessons, with dancers from many different clubs.  Some dancers head for food when lessons are over, while many others stay for the dance.  People, even nonmembers, have been bringing a yummy assortment of snacks, all much appreciated.  Dancers who didn't come for lessons show up to dance with us.
