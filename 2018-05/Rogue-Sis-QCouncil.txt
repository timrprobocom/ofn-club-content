Hi Everyone,

Work is progressing nicely on Summer Festival. If there are any questions, please contact either Lorri McIntosh or Elaine Funk - the Co-Chairmen.

The next 5th Friday Council dance will be on June 29th, in Grants Pass with Wayne Weaver calling and Elaine Funk cueing.  Things are also in the planning stages for the next "Fountain of Youth" dance on July 6, 2018. Stay tuned for more information.

PLEASE support the Council and the clubs in the Rogue Valley. Everyone needs all the support they can get. Times are "skinny," so, please come out and help by supporting your local clubs. We don't want to lose any clubs because of non-support from the dancers.

The next Council meeting will be June 5, 2018 at Denny's Restaurant on Biddle Road at 4:30pm.

PS: Pear Blossom was a HUGE success this year - with close to 8 squares Friday and 10 on Saturday nite!! Eric Henerlau & Dan Drumheller did a fantastic job.  Be sure to join us next year for 2019 Pear Blossom with Jet Roberts & Christina Corelli!

Lois & Lorri
