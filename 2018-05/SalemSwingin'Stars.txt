We are a hopeful people, hopeful for better weather and more dances to attend.

Our 2nd Annual Hobo Dance was very well attended and a huge THANK YOU to Lanie Rickard for making the three delicious stews and Danny Rickard for his awesome decorations. The St. Patrick's Day dance was a fun one too. Our 52nd Birthday Dance is April 20 and elections will also be held that night for the executive board.

Our club has decided to go DARK on Friday May 4 and go as a club to dance at the Pacific Northwest Teen Festival dance from 7:00 - 9:00 pm at Silverton High School in Silverton Oregon.  Our very own Kailee Shields will be competing in the novice square as a Silver Knight. We hope to see many of you there as well.  The competition begins early in the morning of May 5. We will also dance on the third Friday in May.  

We dance all year.  And the Salem Square Dance Center is air conditioned.  We have three dances scheduled for June,  two regular dances on the first and third Fridays and a Plus Dance on the fifth Friday. See you all on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
