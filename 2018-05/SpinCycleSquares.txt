Spin Cycle Squares

We continue to dance Sunday nights from 5:30 - 8:00 at all levels with our competent caller and teacher, Tim Matteson.  We encourage dancers to come dance with us and get more floor time.  Please call our president, David Lajoie at 541-520-7311 or Tim at 541-988-0399 to make sure we are dancing as we go dark once in a blue moon.  We don't want to miss you.  Our dances/classes are always casual.  We always have a lot of food too.  Come for a fun evening almost every Sunday!

April 10 was the annual Dan Nordbye dance.  We had a small turnout, but oh my goodness, the dancers that came had a treat!  Dan called a varied, new and fun program.  Dan is moving to Oregon and let our dancers know.  Everyone cheered.  A big thank you to Lorna Mercer, Tim Matteson, Tim and Cheryl Hagey and Kathy Peters for their help with this dance.  Other dancers helped clean up as well.  It was a FUN dance!

Happy dancing!
