In March Tri Squares' Mainstream Lessons ended, and for the year we gained 7 new members.  We visited our cuer’s other club, the Braids & Braves, for their 57th anniversary at their new, easily-located hall in Dayton with a great dance floor.  Also in March my husband and I danced in Hawaii with a wonderful club called the Paradise Shufflers.  Square dancers everywhere are such nice people! 
 In May please join us for our "Fiesta Time" dance on Saturday the 12th, and for "Making Melody" dance (all singing calls) on Friday the 25th, with Terry Halley and Sandra Pinion.
 For your planning, this summer Tri Squares will be dark in July and August, due to the heat.  We’ll be visiting you!
