Hello everyone, 

Well, it has been a few weeks of hard work but the Oaky Doaks' Round Dance class on Thursday nights has just finished up learning how to Cha (or is that Cha-Cha?). Starting on Thursday, April 12th, we are getting ready to Rhumba. Connie Clark will be putting us through the paces just like she did with the Cha class from 7:00 to 8:30 pm. Hopefully we will be done in time for our first dance in May.
 
Our first dance in May, Saturday May 5th, will be our Anniversary Dance with the theme being “The Roaring 20’s”. It is the period of extreme power and happiness in America. Skirts got smaller and smaller which shocked the older generations and Jazz had developed and spread. Automobiles rolled down the streets and the US was strong and influential in the world. The flapper redefined the modern look for British and American women. It was the time of the 18th and 21st Amendments, Al Capone, Calvin Coolidge, and “The Great Gatsby” by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

Caller Mark Wheeler, aka “Nicky the Bouncer” has said that we can either square dance or sleep with the fishes. Capish?  The Friend of a Friend and Speakeasy Owner, Cuer Molly “With A Twist” Combs will be bringing satisfaction to every round dancer as long as there ain’t no trouble.

Dancing starts at 7:00 with Pre-Round and Mainstream with Rounds starts at 7:30. Break will be at 9:30.

Arthur C. Clarke said, "The only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible." 

On Saturday, May 19th, we will be having a “No Theme” dance where Caller Janienne Alexander and Cuer Molly Combs will lead us into the impossible as we attempt to go beyond the possible limit of fun with square dancing. 

Pre-Rounds start at 7:00 pm, Mainstream with Rounds starts at 7:30 pm and Break will be at 9:30 pm.

Hope to you see you across the square in May.
Gary
