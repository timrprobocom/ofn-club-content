 The TVC has been encouraging all member clubs to attend all anniversary dances.  A record of sorts is being tracked regarding attendance.  The Hoedowner anniversary set a high mark of 112 dancers but the Columbia River Dancers anniversary dance on March 10th broke that mark with 115!
 The TVC 5th Saturday Spring Fling Dance, on March 31st was attended by 15 different clubs.  It was held at the Kinton Grange featuring Janienne Alexander calling with Mark McDonald cueing.  This dance was co-hosted by the Tualatin Timber Squares.
 The next TVC event will be a very special dance with a very different format.  On the 5th Saturday, June 30th, there will be a Mainstream to Advance event at the Aloha Grange.  There will be mainstream, intro to plus, plus, and intro to A.
