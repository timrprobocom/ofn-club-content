Thank you to everyone who attended our April dance. This was also a Friday the 13th so we had a couple of black cats hidden around the hall.

Teen Festival is May 4 & 5!!!! We hope you are planning to come and watch. If you have already volunteered to help out - THANK YOU!!! For those coming, the Silverton Elks will have their food booth at the high school for those who want to catch a quick something without having to leave the school grounds. Their prices are reasonable.

On Saturday, we have two squares of our youth dancing to singing calls in the morning; one of the squares will be dancing to the "Mysteries" in the afternoon. Our youth callers compete in both singing and patter in the morning. Our cuer competes both morning and afternoon. We have two round dance couples who will do their "compulsory" dances (memorized waltz and 2-step) in the afternoon. One of the couples will dance to "Mystery Hash" in the morning. Our group will have an entry in the Exhibition category in the evening and our round dance couple will participate in the Display of Rounds in the evening. The Grand March starts early - at 7:00 am. The fun dance on Saturday will start around 7:00 pm and the Awards will start close to 8:30 pm.

Friday night fun dance will start at 7:00 pm and end by 9:00 pm - we want the kids to get some sleep since they have to get up and moving so early in the morning. Petrina Buchheit
