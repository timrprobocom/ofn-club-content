March 3 was a big night for the Lebanon Square Circlers as it was our  "Hippie Dance".  Lots of peace makers, crazy dudes and other creative costumes made the evening a lot of fun.  Charlotte Jeskey called and Jackie Gale cued with five squares in attendance.  Our next dance was on March 17 -- St Patrickâ€™s Day. Then on April 7 we had our Bunny Hop Dance and the first Saturday in May is Cinco de Mayo dance. 

Of course, we are already preparing for our Strawberry Festival weekend -- the first weekend of June.  There will be the Silent  Auction, Experienced Clothing Sale, potlucks, parade, dancing, and strawberry shortcake. Our guest caller on Saturday night will be Andy Garboden from Washington -- originally growing up in Lebanon.  Hope everyone is making plans to attend. 
Many of our club members also went on the Coast Trip weekend sponsored by the Corvallis Squares.

On March 31, 2018, the Lebanon Square Circlers went on its Mystery Trip.  We started our journey at 5:00 PM in Lebanon, then picked up other dancers from the Timber Twirlers, Corvallis Squares, and Sweet Home Squarenaders; and finally  a couple from the Silver City Squares in Salem as we headed north.  Our trip was planned by Frank Cawrse, with help from Wanda Frenzel, Barb Shaefer, and Marianne Cawrse.  It was a lively time with lots of crazy songs, jokes and stories -- up and back. Our destination was the Kinton Grange with a great dance sponsored by the Tualatin Valley Area Council.   
 
Our next dance will be a Bunny Hop dance with an Easter bonnet contest.  Our first dance in May is the Cinco de Mayo dance with tacos served. See you in a square!
