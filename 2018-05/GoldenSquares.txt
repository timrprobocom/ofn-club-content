This winter has been hard on Golden Squares as our attendance has been down.  We did welcome home our snowbird at the first dance in April.  Welcome home Dolly!  As I write this, I am hoping a lot of you show up for our Pie Night on the fifth Monday in April.  We always have fresh homemade pie and a good time. 
 We dance on the first, third and fifth Mondays so please keep us in mind.  Give me a call or text if you have questions. Happy Spring,  Teija
