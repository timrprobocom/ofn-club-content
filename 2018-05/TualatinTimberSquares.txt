Tualatin Timber Squares is celebrating our 2nd Anniversary on the 4th Wednesday in April.  This will be a basic level dance with every third tip Mainstream in order to include all the new dancers in the area.  Bring your students and come have fun with us!
 Our lessons are coming along marvelously.  Please consider coming out and joining us.  We love our guests and there is always food!  In May we will continue our weekly Wednesday lessons in a dance format.  No standing around during long explanations.  We like to kick up our heels and have fun!
