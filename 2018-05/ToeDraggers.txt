Life is looking good with this nice weather out.  We gathered our Irish shamrocks for our Shamrock Sashay Dance in March and shared them all around to make a fun and relaxed time for everyone.
 Bev and Harlan Flint finished up their last class of round dancing lessons.  The class so enjoyed their time and are now out practicing up a storm.  Thanks Bev and Harlan for a great time together.
 Hope you found the April 6th dance out at the Odd Fellows Hall in Hillsboro.  Our grange wasn’t available that evening but we will be back to the Kinton Grange for the rest of our dances, which brings us to our April 20th Cherry Blossom Festival Dance.  Let’s get into our Spring square dance clothes for this one and come for a fun time.
 May is set to go with May 4th Fillies and Lilies theme.  We always like sharing about the Kentucky Derby with Bev and Harlan leading the way.  They are the horse lovers of our club.   May 18th is our regular dance of the month.  Come join us for both dances in May with KC and Linda calling and Bev and Harlan cueing.  We love our caller-cuer team and enjoy dancing with them so much. 
 We have a Mystery Trip planned in May and looking forward to the ?????? of what surprises are ahead of us!!!  
 We’ll be voting on new officers soon.  Seems like this year has gone by so fast.  Hope to see you in a square.
