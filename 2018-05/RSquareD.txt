On March 9th, our St. Patrickâ€™s Dance, four squares were "Wear'n o' the Green" including visitors from Cougar Squares, Wave Steppers, Columbia River Dancers, Happy Hoppers and Ruff & Ruffles.  Guest caller Adam Christman called a fun dance as always.  Many Irish-themed rounds were cued by our own Lonnie Sykes.
 We had a visitation the following evening with Adam calling at the Columbia River Dancers third anniversary.  
 Then on March 24, we held our Spring Fling Dance and Progress Center fund raiser.  The Progress Center provides early intervention for developmentally delayed children 3 and under.  We collected nearly $500, way to go dancers!  Guest caller, Mike Stout from Hillsboro's Sunset Promenaders called a lively dance.  We got a bonus when Lonnie invited Mike's wife, Julie to cue a couple of rounds.
 On May 11th we will be having our Cinco de Mayo Celebration.  Come a little early and enjoy the taco bar at 6:00pm.  We will be dark on May 26th for the Memorial Day weekend.
