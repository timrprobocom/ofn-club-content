We are delighted at the participation of our outstanding 2017-2018 IWW Mainstream Class graduates and our new club members at IWW and other area dances.  We look forward to their continued contribution to the square dance community.

Our 58th Birthday Dance on March 10 was a fun dance with many guests.  Imagine!  58 years!  What will the next 58 years hold?  By press time, we will have had a Mystery Trip on April 14, our dance hall being unavailable that night. The destination is still a mystery but It is certain to have been a fun time. Speaking of fun times, we will also have enjoyed our annual Koast Krash by the time you read this. 

The new Board takes office on May 1. Many thanks go to the outgoing and incoming Board members for your leadership and hard work. 

We are excited that Patty Hermann has accepted our invitation to be our Club Cuer, and are looking forward to wonderful dancing under the leadership of the Hermann Dynamic Duo.  Be sure to join us for our “Kentucky Derby Dance” on May 5. Ladies are encouraged to wear a dressy hat, of the sort that you see the ladies wearing at the Derby. And come dance with us at our regular dances on the first and second Saturdays at the Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall. Dee and Bert Mackaman
