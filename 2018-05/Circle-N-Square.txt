We had a good time at our Swingin' to the Oldies Dance.  Annie Blaylock and Roger Slaikeu have started teaching rounds on our Monday nights and before our dances.  Great job you two.

There were a few of our dancers that made it up to the Pear Blossom Festival and had a great time dancing to Eric Henerlau.

We are looking forward to the many dances in May that we can go out and strut our stuff.  Our next dance is the Armed Forces Day Dance on Saturday, May 19th.

See you on the dance floor.
