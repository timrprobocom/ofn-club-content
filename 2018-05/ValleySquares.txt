Pirates & Irishmen danced their square dance jigs at our Pirates of the Caribbean dance on March 3rd, and the Luck of The Irish dance on March 17th. 
 Sandwiched between those dances we joined many other dancers at the Columbia River Dancers 3rd Anniversary.  Adam Christman called a very lively and interesting dance.  Fun was had by all.  It was a large dance with a great turnout.
 Our students are fast learners and had a marvelous time at the Sunset Promenaders New Dancers Jamboree on March 18th and then our Jamboree on March 20th. 
 Please join us for our dances May 5th & 19th at Aloha Grange.
