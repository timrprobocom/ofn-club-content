Our next scheduled dances are June 30, September 29 and December 29.  We'll have to decide whether or not we';ll actually have a dance December 29 since New Year's Eve is just a couple of days later. 

We have new officers for CCCA.  We want to thank Linda Putzler, Sandy Harris, Gail Jackson and Christina Corelli for being officers last year.  Here is our new board: President: - Pat Cox, Vice-President - Jackie Gale, Secretary - Christina Corelli and Treasurer - Gail Jackson.

Our March 31 dance was the annual area benefit dance for Honor Flight.  Around $2,700 + was presented to Honor Flight.  Thank you one and all!  What a great dance.  Thank you for your generosity.  Several dancers wore their Honor Flight T-shirts as they had gone as chaperones or veterans.  Thank you to all of our veterans for their service to our country.

Keep on dancing, calling and cueing for FUN
Christina Corelli
Secretary  - CCCA
