Summer is eagerly waiting for us just around the corner and I can hardly wait for all that it has to offer; warmer weather, longer days and many special square dance weekends.  Please consider attending at least one of these special dance events.

May 4-5 will be the Pacific NW Teen Square Dance Festival and competition at Silverton High School.  Read Karyn Buchheit’s article later in this issue for more information and a schedule of events.  Karyn still needs a few volunteers, so be sure to contact her if you are available to help.

May 25th is the kick off for the Charlie Brown’s annual Boatnik Festival at the Josephine County Square Dance Center in Grants Pass.  This weekend dance has something for everyone, from easy Mainstream to Advance.  There will also be Rounds and a Rounds Workshop.  Check out the flyer in the Special Dance section.

June 8-9 is the annual Buckeroo Round-up at the Buckaroo Square Dance Barn in Roseburg.  If you have never visited the Wildlife Safari in Winston, this weekend event finishes with a special benefit dance at the park on June 10.  Flyers for both events are in the Special Dance section.

June 22-24 is the Oregon Summer Festival in beautiful Grants Pass.  The committee has been hard at work planning many special events for us.  If you have kids and grandkids that dance, be sure to bring them with you.  While you are dancing, you can relax knowing your kids are having fun dancing and partying with other kids. You will find the flyer and a link to their registration form under “Summer Festival”.

July 25-28 brings the Star Promenaders’ annual Diamond Lake Festival in Medford.  This will be the 45th year of dancing outside at Diamond Lake.  This is a unique and beautiful setting for a dance weekend.   Their flyer is on their website at: [www.diamondlakefestival.com/Flyers.html](www.diamondlakefestival.com/Flyers.html)

August 9-11 is Central Oregon’s annual Central Oregon Roundup in Sisters.  They have many fun activities planned for your enjoyment including a Flash Mob, breakfast and a silent auction.  Their flyer is in the Special Dance section.

In addition to trying to attend at of these fun filled weekends, I’d like to invite you to visit at least one new club or a club that you haven’t visited for some time this month.  Don’t be shy, grab your square dance duds and go and visit – you will be glad you did.  You won’t find any strangers at these clubs, what you will find are friends you just hadn’t met yet.

Until next month,  
Kathy Roberts  
OFSRDC President
