March was a busy month for the Sunset Promenaders because of three sets of lessons on each Sunday: phase two Rounds at 2-4; then Mainstream lessons from 4-6; and then intermediate Rounds 6:30 to 8:00.
 This has been fun but exhausting in a sense, too.  We are really happy to see so many people interested in learning square dance and round dance.  Our club has been slowly losing members  and this new wave of people is refreshing to see.  Our club needs new people and we are now getting new people; WOW this is great.  Hopefully we can continue to keep them involved and they will want to help us be a good square dance club.
 On May 3rd, 17th, and 31st are our Thursday Plus Dances with Darrell Kalmbach and Ken Pratt calling and cueing.
 May 5th is the first of our Mainstream Dances for this month with the theme of Memorial Day with Mike Stout calling and Julie Stout cueing.  May 19th is our Roaring 20â€™s Dance with Mike Stout calling and Ken Pratt cueing.
 Our schedule for each dance is Intermediate Round dance at 7:00, Mainstream Square Dance starts at 7:30 until 9:30 with a break time following.  Additional parking is available at the bank across the street.  The Location is IOOF Hall (upstairs) at 267 E. Main St. in Hillsboro.  503-805-5867 for information.
