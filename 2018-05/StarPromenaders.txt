Well, Spring has sure sprung here at my house. A house 

I am getting to see a lot of with my well-broken arm/wrist substantially supported higher than my heart and iced as needed(which seems to be all the time).  So as I am happily one-handed typing this saga Pear Blossom is finishing up with the Sunday morning Sessions.  I have had one call from an attendee who was having a great time.  Sure hope it was a great success!!!!!

    Next comes Boatnik and then Mid-summer and then Buckaroo and the Diamond Lake.  WOW What a SUMMER. And there are other Festivals out there that are gleefully evading my mind right now.  So have lots of good summer dancing.

    Our Sunday New Dancer Class is doing well and having a great turnout. Last Sunday they had a potluck and Masquerade Dance which included a 75th Birthday party for our retiring caller. Phil did the calling and Wayne did the enjoying.  It was nice to see so many people gathered to have fun!!!!!

    Oh yes, Wayne is home and A1/2 classes are back on Wednesday.  Thursdays have a mainstream Workshop followed by a Plus Class.

    Hope to see you somewhere â€¦ Have a good Summer!!!   Oh Yeah....  Picnic still on at my place on Memorial Day after noon.  I can pitch horseshoes one handed so come on out and join us.  Bring food to go with hot dogs and hamburgers.  If you want to cook yourself something different, bring that and we will work it in on the grill.   160 Raintree Drive, Cave Junction.

Ladies to the center...
