Wasn’t that a great dinner/dance and play we had at the Cut-Ups March 18?  12 squares were in attendance, as well as some guests from the community to watch us dance between acts.  We got to guess who blew up the outhouse with the sheriff inside!  Then we got to guess who did it.  Some guessed caller Scott Zinser, who wasn’t even part of the play!  I have to admit he looked a little shady.

The endeavor will help the Cut-Ups purchase a portable outdoor dance floor for the summer months, and form a lot of camaraderie for the club.
