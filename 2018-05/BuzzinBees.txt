Greetings from the Buzzin Bees! I am amazed that it is already May and we only have three more dances in this season. We had a successful 60th anniversary dance, our Diamond Jubilee. We attended the Silver Stars anniversary dance in April. Our May dances happen to fall on 5 / 5 - Cinco de Mayo and on 5 / 19 - Armed Forces Day so we have built-in themes for May. We will have Hispanic themed treats for the break after dancing on 5/5 and possibly even some non-alcoholic Margaritas. On 5/19 we will wear red, white, and blue. We plan to decorate the hall with military uniforms. Come and show your appreciation for our military men and women.

Starting in May we will be making a format change.  On the first Saturday of the month we will still do our usual format with pre rounds at 7 p.m., mainstream starting at 7:30 with every third tip being plus. We dance from 7:30 to 9:30 with a break after dancing.  On the third Saturday dance we will start having a Pre Plus workshop at 7 p.m. followed by mainstream at 7:30 with every 3rd tip plus. Dorothy Lowder is our cuer on the first Saturday of the month and Lonnie Sykes cues on the third Saturday. Our caller is K.C. Curtis. If you have never danced to K.C. you're in for a treat when he pulls out his harmonica! We have a great time. Enjoy the spring!
