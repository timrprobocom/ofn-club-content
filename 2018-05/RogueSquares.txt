The Rogue Squares are now on a limited dance schedule. We are dancing only in January and July for now. We will give this a trial and see what happens. In the meantime, we are dancing at the other clubs in our Council and once in a while, we will go to Yreka, Klamath Falls or Roseburg and see what's happening there.

Our July 20th dance is "Potluck Birthday Party for the United States." The caller will be Phil Ramey and the cuer will be Elaine Funk. Potluck starts at 5:30pm. See the flyer for details. This dance is for any dancer who likes a good time and for the recent graduates (both September and January classes).

We are still working on the future for the The Rogue Squares.

See you in a square!!
