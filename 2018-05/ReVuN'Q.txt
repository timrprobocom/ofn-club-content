ReVuNQ is about to experience a BIG change. Our cuer, Cheryl Manley and her husband Geof, are moving to Blackfoot, ID in the near future, which means we will be on a search for a new cuer and instructor. They have purchased a home, but need to sell their home also. Cheryl will be near family and will come back on occasion to see Geof’s family and their daughter. It is a huge loss to our small club. We are going to work on keeping it going.
Our Jive class continues until the end of the month, when Cheryl is tentatively finished cueing for us. We are a small group but we are improving on what we already know. We have “railroaded” the officers into one more year of service.
Our birthday dance is on June 14, #42. Hope you can join us in a party night of dancing to our favorites. Cross your fingers that we survive this huge change. Marilyn Schmit
