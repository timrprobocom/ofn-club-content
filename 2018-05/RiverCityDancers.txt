At our general membership meeting later in May, we will decide whether to keep this new schedule. Next monthâ€™s article will include our decision about our dance time and also our list of new officers.

We dance every second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community Center in Milwaukie. This allows us to dance with most other clubs . Our members enjoy going on visitations to other clubs every month. In March , 20 of us visited Columbia River Dancers in Vancouver. Since we brought over two squares, they gave us back our own banner and one of theirs. We welcome them and all dancers to come visit us . Both couples and singles are warmly welcomed. If you come see us and bring at least 8 dancers we will give you one of our banners and then bring our gang to come visit you. Last month we had visitations from BnB and Country Cut Ups.  We enjoyed having them and are planning to visit them soon.
