Our 57th Birthday dance was great! We had three squares on the floor and visitors from several clubs. 

March is over and it’s supposed to be Spring, but it can't seem to quit throwing that nasty white stuff at us! April showers should be good for our May flowers.

Our new dancers are practicing their skills and even visiting other clubs, something I love to do. It’s a great way to support Square Dancing and meet new friends. Clubs will be offering classes so invite someone else to enjoy this wonderful activity.  Carmen
