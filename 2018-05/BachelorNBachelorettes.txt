Our bathroom remodel is underway, headed by none other than our beloved President, Glenn Hauskins.  He’s already enlarged the door so that we can go in and out without scrunching our petticoats on the door frame – so nice.

During our semi-annual meeting, we elected Glenn Hauskins, President; Gene Neils, V-P; Patricia Neils, Scty; Sue Harrel, Treasurer; Jim Schira and Mary Theirl, PAC Rep’s.
