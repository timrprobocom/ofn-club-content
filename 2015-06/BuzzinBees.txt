Greetings from the Buzzin Bees. Woo hoo!  Summer is here. As we are ramping up for summer activities; our club is ramping down for the summer.  We have our officers elected, our last dance planned. 

Our final dance is set for 6/6/15. We have a BBQ planned for before the dance and all are welcome.  We will be grilling hamburgers and hot dogs, have lots of salads  and chips. We will eat at 6:30, pre-rounds at 7:30 and squares at 8pm. 

We held elections last month and our officers for the next year are President Dennis and Julie Woods, Vice president Elmer and Betty Toops, Treasurer Bruce Prenguber, and Secretary Holly Grissom. I want to thank our outgoing secretary Barbra Meisenheimer for all her hard work as secretary, visitation planner , flier maker, and great idea person. She is an enthusiastic dancer and great fun.

We did a demonstration dance at Mallard Landing Assisted living in Battleground, WA. We had good resident turn out and they really enjoyed 2 of our special dancers, our youngsters. We went for pizza after the demonstration. We will have a club picnic in July for planning the next year.  

Bill Lundin has announced that he has accepted a position with the Lions and will be doing a lot of traveling on weekends so he plans to step down as club caller at the end of the year so the search is on. Bill isn't retiring from calling altogether and he will still be a member of the club.

We wish you a happy and safe summer.
