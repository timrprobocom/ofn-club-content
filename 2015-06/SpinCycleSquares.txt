Spin Cycle Squares, Springfield
     We are dark May 24, Memorial Day.  We are getting ready for the big recruitment dance, August 22nd, a Saturday.  We usually dance on Sundays, but we'll be dark on August 23rd.  The August 22nd dance is free to new dancers and is a welcome-to-square-dance fun day.  We'll have a huge potluck for which we are famous.  A more detailed schedule will be out next month.  This is a great opportunity to bring people to witness just how much fun square dancing is.  Christina Corelli will be on hand to cue a round or two and get folks involved in a line dance or mixer.
     Spin Cycle Squares had a huge percentage of our club help clean the dance hall recently.  We are so happy to be dancing there and we're happy to help.  David Lajoie and Kurt Jensen were up on the scaffolding again this year to clean the upper windows and install the new Danebo Circle 8 signboard.  Leah Firth climbed up there as well and helped.  It's amazing how much light comes in when the windows are clean!
     Come dance with us Sundays at 5:30.  All levels.  Tim Matteson, our caller and instructor, is so good about making sure dancers get floor time, no matter what level.  We are so blessed!  Please call David at 541-520-7311 or Tim at 541-988-0399 as there may be a slim chance we are not dancing.
     If you want floor time, you've got it with us!
