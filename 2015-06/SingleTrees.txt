Single Trees, Springfield
     Jim Voll called our April 10th Spring Bonnet Dance and prizes (potted geraniums) were awarded for 1st, 2nd and 3rd Place.  There were some very creative hats there.  Christina Corelli cued the round dancing.
     Terry Halley called our April 24th dance and Christina cued again.
     June 12th will be our Annual Reigning Cats and Dogs Dance, a benefit to support Greenhill Humane Society; Mike and Helen Halley on stage.  Scott Zinser is scheduled to call and Christina to cue our June 26th dance.
