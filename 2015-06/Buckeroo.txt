We began the month of May with our Mexican Fiesta celebrating Dos de Mayo. The May 16th dance found many of our dancers sporting red, white and blue as we recognized our Armed Forces.  So that our members can attend the Summer Festival and the Diamond Lake Festival the Buckeroos will be going dark both of our July dances.
The annual elections were held the first Saturday in May and the following officers were elected:
President -Doris Koozer, Vice President-Ray Blessing, Treasurer-Robert Reynolds, and Secretary-David Harman.  Three new Chairperson Heads were appointed as well and we welcome them to the Board.  Mary Upthagrove will be taking over the Special Dances, Bruce and Laura Knotts together will serve as the Membership chairperson, Jim Irwin will serve as the Lesson Coordinator and Robin Faltersack will be helping with Publicity. A round of congrats and thank you&rsquo;s go out to our Buckeroo Board who volunteer so much time to make the club run smoothly.  August will be here soon and we hope to see you in your square dance attire on the dance floor with us at the Douglas County Fair.   

Happy Dancing,
Rita Schuchard
