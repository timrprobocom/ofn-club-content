 The Tri-Squares are happily staying busy as we transition this next year. In late April we had our annual board meeting. During the meeting new officers were elected and past officers were recognized for their hard work and dedication. A special thank you goes to our past president Linda Ray-Keeney for the positive, progressive changes to Tri-Squares. Our annual board meeting also consisted of honoring six founding members of Tri-Squares. 
 Tri-Squares recently enjoyed a visitation from the Toe Draggers. They brought a total of 16 dancers and took home two banners. The &ldquo;Toes&rdquo; brought their club caller K.C. Curtis and Cuer Bev Flint which made for a very exciting dance. Thank you Toe Draggers for bringing a positive energy to our Fiesta Dance. 
 Our next dance will be on June 6th. We encourage all to join us on our "Blue Danube Cruise". The ship will leave port at 7:30 PM starting with 15 minutes of pre-rounds and 15 minutes of plus. At 8PM we will start mainstream with every fourth tip plus. We will end the dance with light refreshments.  
 We look forward to dancing with all of our friends, new and old this June!
