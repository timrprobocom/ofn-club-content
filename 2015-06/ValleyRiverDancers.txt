     A packed house welcomed Canadian caller Steve Edlund to the Valley River Dancers' stage in early May. Seven squares and double rings of round dancers filled the floor with international flair and fun. VRD also hosts the Mid-Willamette trophy banner dance on Friday, May 22.
     Tuesday night plus and advanced lessons/workshops continue in June; drop-ins are welcome.
      It's not too early to save the date for the annual Dance Under the Stars on Friday evening, July 24, during the Newberg Old Fashioned Festival. In the meantime please join us for our first-Friday plus and third-Friday mainstream dances.  Perrin
