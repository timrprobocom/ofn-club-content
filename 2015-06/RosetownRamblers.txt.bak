On May 2, the Ramblers enjoyed a Cinco de Mayo themed potluck at the Milwaukie Grange. We then graduated 12 fabulous and dedicated Mainstream students and proceeded to tear up the dance floor with Chuck Garner&rsquo;s up-tempo calling. Chuck taught our Mainstream class last fall, so it was great to welcome him back. We also received a visit from our current instructor, Mark Wheeler, and his wife, Enid. Mark delighted us with a singing call in his inimitable style. We topped off the evening with graduation cake honoring our 2015 class: Rainbow Knockout!
 
We neglected last month to report on the most recent recipient of our Rambler Extraordinaire award: Brian Arnzen. For many years, Brian has tracked all our members&rsquo; birthdays and made birthday cards for presentation at our monthly dances. Brian&rsquo;s tireless efforts have enhanced the camaraderie and friendships in our club, and we really appreciate him! 
 
We will continue with weekly dances on Wednesday nights at the Ankeny St. Studio at SE 9th and Ankeny in Southeast Portland. We will have Mainstream workshop nights on May 6 and 13 and Mainstream/Plus dancing on May 20 and 27. All are welcome to join us from 7-9 pm. We especially welcome solo dancers!
 
We&rsquo;ll be dancing at the Milwaukie Grange on Saturday, June 6, alternating Mainstream and Plus tips from 7-9:30. Don Wood will be calling. Our theme will be Rainbow Pride&mdash;all are encouraged to wear rainbow colors!
 
We will be dark in July. HOWEVER, we will be having an ice cream social and free taste of square dancing on Saturday, August 1 at the Ankeny St. Studio. All are welcome. Mark your calendars and keep an eye out for details in next month&rsquo;s OFN.
 
Finally, early warning that our September dance at the Milwaukie Grange will move to the second Saturday, that is September 12, to avoid conflicting with Labor Day weekend. We hope that some of our friends who normally dance elsewhere on first Saturdays will be able to join us as a result of this date change!
 
SYIAS!
