 GOING CASUAL STARTS EARLY THIS YEAR!   That's right.  Work began Wednesday, April 22, on new restrooms at Winona Grange.  For four to six weeks we will have PortaPotties, which don't mix well with petticoats.  Check our website, www.mixandminglesquares.org, for updates on the work in progress.   We hope to celebrate the completion with our annual Red, White, and Blue dance, strawberries, homemade vanilla ice cream, and blueberries on June 20.   Stay tuned!
