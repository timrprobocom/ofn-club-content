The Milton-Freewater Muddy Frogs will be dark in June.  Due to Mother's Day, State meetings, a wedding, and our caller and cuer Bill & Neva Reid's coming move from The Dalles to Wallowa Lake, the jive/swing social ballroom classes will end on May 3 and resume October 3, when new square dance lessons will begin.  Other than a special dance on July 4 in Yantis Park in Milton-Freewater, dancing, also in that park, on Sunday, August 16, a Blue Mountain Council meeting, barbeque, and dance, also in Yantis Park, on August 30, dancing on the float in the Walla Walla Fair Parade September 5, and a demo in downtown Walla Walla on September 19, the Frogs will be dark for the summer.  Times will be announced later.  The Muddy Frogs also help sponsor the Wallowa Mountain Rendezvous at Wallowa Lake the weekend of September 11-13, called and cued by Bill and Neva and Roger Putzler, so we won't be exactly twiddling our thumbs and renting out our dancing shoes!
