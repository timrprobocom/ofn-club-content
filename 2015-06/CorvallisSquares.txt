   Our co-president, Deb Hackleman, wants to extend her thanks to all who have sent cards, called, or come by to see her following her accident on April 18. Recently when I visited her, she said she had heard from former caller Stu Taylor, who called for the Promenaders back in the day. Deb has an upbeat attitude and we all wish her a smooth and steady recovery.
     Our spring dances have been a lot of fun, and it's been great to see several of our new dancers join in. We have a few demo dances planned for this summer to get the word out about square dancing and how enjoyable it is!
      In June, we will have our members' annual summer kick-off potluck and talk about plans for the fall. We'll be holding mainstream lessons again, and are already talking it up with co-workers, neighbors, and friends!   Karen
