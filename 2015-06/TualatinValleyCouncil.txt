 If you are reading this in May, you still have time to plan on attending the 5th Saturday TVC dance on May 30th.   The dance will be held at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro.  The scheduled caller was to be Jim Hattrick but due to health issues, will not be able to do the dance.  Our Council Caller Advisor, Daryl Clendenin will be the Caller MC and Tami Helms will be the Cuer MC.  Callers and cuers will be invited to participate from the floor.  The dance will begin at 7:30 with pre-rounds followed at 8:00 with a mainstream dance interspersed with plus and intermediate rounds.  There will be an open break from 8:30 to 10:30.
 The Council has elected officers for the upcoming year with President, Gary Clark; Vice-President, Dale Brabham; Treasurer, Lane Clem; and  Secretary, Tom Sminia, all continuing their roles from last year.  Thank you for your dedication.  Our Council delegates are doing a fantastic job in bringing their clubs concerns to the Council as well as taking the Councils information to their clubs.
 After the fifth Saturday dance, the next TVC event will be our annual Hahn Barn Dance on August 29th.  There will be a potluck picnic by the lake at 6:30 PM preceding the dance on the barn.  There will more details in future editions of the OFN.
