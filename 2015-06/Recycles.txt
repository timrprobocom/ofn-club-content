Well, the suspense is over and "the other shoe has dropped".   Our club has now closed its doors.

The Recycles' final Plus dance on May 8th was attended by our many faithful guests and six of our seven members.  A special treat for the evening was the presence of our past callers Dick Click (and Ruth H.) and Darrell (and Erin) Kalmbach, who both called tips. 

The Recycles was formed 20 years ago when the Mainstream clubs Circul-8-N Singles and Fun Lovers combined and held dances for singles and couples, first at the Frog Pond Grange and then in Tualatin at the Winona Grange.  After 11 years, the energies of the dwindling membership began to wane and they were going to close the club.  

In 2006 another small group decided to revitalize the Recycles and it became a Plus club.  Our membership remained small-but-dedicated---and determined to try our best to continue providing an enjoyable evening of dance.  We have lasted almost 9 years because of lots of hard work by our members and officers---but especially because our excellent callers, Darrell Kalmbach and Scott Zinser, and our cuer, Jeanine Norden, created such good fun for all!

Special recognition goes to past members Paul and Dianne Cap who organized a fundraiser for us, our Secretary, Sue Shoemaker, who created all of our charming flyers and was our Portland Area Council representative, and Ferrous Steinka of the Hoedowners who was our website's Master.  Ted Olinger (and Sally Knigge) faithfully opened our hall early and Don Green also arrived early to help.

 And of course, many thanks to all of our officers who have served so faithfully and well: Richard Smith, President; Harriet Livingston and Tom Dymowski, Vice Presidents; Sue Shoemaker, Secretary; and Cynthia Ekberg, Treasurer.
