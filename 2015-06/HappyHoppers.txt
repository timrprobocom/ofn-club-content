We are sad to note the passing of Brenda Martinez, on April 14th.  Brenda left us too early, at the age of 55, due to the ravages of a syndrome called calciphylaxis.  She and her husband, Jim, recently served the Happy Hoppers as club presidents.  Our hearts go out to Jim and the rest of Brenda's circle of family and friends in this time of loss.  Many of us joined Jim in a gathering on April 18th at the Hazel Dell Grange to share thoughts and memories of Brenda.

Our weekly square dance lessons are now on summer vacation.  We are proud of the fact that during this past school year (September 2014 through April 2015) we welcomed 91 new dancers, plus a group of 13 one-time dancers.   The Happy Hoppers work hard to make our education program a comfortable environment for newcomers.  Lessons will pick up again on Monday, September 14th.

As usual, we will hold two club dances in June, on the first and third Saturday evening, at the Clark County Square Dance Center.   Rounds start at 7:30 and Squares (at the Plus level) start at 8:00.

While our club caller, Jim Hattrick, is off dealing with his medical situation, we have been lucky to have various callers and cuers from the community coming in to take care of us.  On June 6, Les Seeley will be calling and Molly Combs will be cueing.  On June 20, for our annual "Strawberry Shortcake" dance, Richard Lane will be calling and Molly Combs will be cueing.  The "Strawberry Shortcake" dance is always a fun time, so you don't want to miss that one.

In July and August our club dance schedule goes "dark", allowing the Happy Hoppers to disperse to points unknown, spreading the joy.  We'll start up again in September.

The highpoint of the summer season, our annual club picnic will take place on Sunday, August 2, at Don and Joanne Oja's farm.
