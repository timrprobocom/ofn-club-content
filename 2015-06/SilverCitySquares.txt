Our club sent 21 youth dancers up to Langley British Columbia, Canada on May 1 & 2.  We had two squares competing in Junior Squares, two round dance couples and  two callers. The Silver Dragons placed second in Junior Squares. We don&rsquo;t know yet just where the Silver Knights placed – we are waiting for them to post the scores so that mom can get it for us.
      Our big surprise was that both of our round couples placed! Logan Williams and Audrey Meyerhofer tied for second place in Novice Rounds while Thomas Buchheit and Emily Meyerhofer took FIRST PLACE in Novice Rounds. Thomas and I don&rsquo;t know where exactly we placed in calling competition. We have to wait for mom to get the scores. Thomas was up against 10 others in Junior Level Calling and I competed against four others in the Pre-Teen Level Calling. Our adult club members and mentors are all pleased and very proud of us. We all had lots of fun going up to the competition and seeing our friends from the other clubs again.  Petrina Buchheit
