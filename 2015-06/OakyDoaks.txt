A warm thank you to all the guests who helped us celebrate our 55th Anniversary!  Hope you had fun dancing with &lsquo;Elvis&rsquo;!  Thank you to Scott Coon for coming from Seattle and giving us a matinee performance of Elvis hits, and then an evening of dancing to Elvis&rsquo; songs.  We enjoyed providing a big spread of Cinco de Mayo foods in between for a leisurely sit down supper together with our many friends who came along to share the fun and celebrate with us.

Our Picnic Dance on the 6th of June marks the beginning of our casual dress for the summer months; don&rsquo;t forget the Oak Grove Community Hall is air conditioned.  And we will be &lsquo;Springing into Summer&rsquo; by changing up the weather!

We&rsquo;ll continue offering Intermediate Rounds from 7:00-7:20 pm.  From 7:20-7:40 pm we will alternate a Square Dance workshop (1st Saturday) and a Round Dance workshop (3rd Saturday) followed by Easy Rounds from 7:40-8:00 pm.  These changes will enable all dancers to add to their dance moves repertoire in a gentle fashion.  Look forward to seeing and dancing with you!  Remember!  We&rsquo;re NOT dark all summer! And we&rsquo;re a cool place to be on hot summer nights.
Hope to see many of you at the PAC picnic on June 16 (6:00 pm at the North Clackamas Park!)
