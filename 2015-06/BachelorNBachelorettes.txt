Our new officers:  President, Mike Wagner; V-P, Sue Burns; Secretary, Patricia Neils; Treasurer, Cynthia Ekberg; Council Delegates, Jim Schira and Mary Theirl.

It&rsquo;s going to really hurt, to see our former President and Queen Bee go out to the Great Bookkeeping Pasture, but we&rsquo;ll assign a couple drones to keep her company.  She helped us immensely, as she did the Recycles.

May 29th is your BIG CHANCE to again enjoy the calling of the incomparable Jim Steele.  Many long-time dancers still remember him calling as a teenager and how he could call at breakneck speed.  Of course, we want more, nowadays, than fast calls.  His calling last year at the Juniper Jubilee showed he still comes up with cleaver combinations.

June 17th will be our Christmas in June Dance.  C&rsquo;mon out to request all your favorite Christmas music.
