The Bachelor Beauts have had a busy spring.  Ron Bliven&rsquo;s sense of humor and gentle teaching style gained us ten graduating new dancers.  We are so glad to have them with us on the floor at our dances.

And speaking of dances, the April highlight had to be the club&rsquo;s luau party.  We filled up the grange with friends, food, and gobs of door prizes, and then danced the night away with guest caller Dan Preedy and cuer Ken Pratt.  The decorations were fabulous, and the club members who helped make this special dance such a success deserve a big mahalo for all their work. In May we hosted the Oregon Federation state meeting, and we enjoyed visiting and dancing with friends from around the state during the evening&rsquo;s dance.

Continuing as officers for the upcoming year are Paul Ostrom, President, Marial Gertz, Vice President, Layne Milowe, Secretary, and Lonnie Waak, Treasurer.  We look forward to another fine year with this experienced team at the helm.

We&rsquo;ll be dancing in June and August but dark in July.  We&rsquo;d love to have any dancers from around the state who are vacationing in Bend this summer join us. Casual dress is just fine if you don&rsquo;t want to pack extra clothes.  Information about our club and all the other area clubs is online at http://centraloregoncouncil.org.
