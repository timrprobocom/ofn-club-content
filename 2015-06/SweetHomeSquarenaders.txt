Sweet Home Squarenaders, Sweet Home
     We recently returned from a wonderful weekend at Camp Koinonia!  It was a bit damp outside, but we still enjoyed fellowship with friends, all kinds of games, square dancing with Jim Voll and Leonard Snodgrass, round dancing and work-shopping the Jive with Jackie Gale, learning Plus with Leonard, listening to the music of Jerry Parks and "crew," and other fun activities.
     Our Wild, Wild West BBQ and Dance is May 9, and then our last regular dance is our Red, White and Blue Dance on June 13th.  We will also hold a dance during the Brownsville Pioneer Picnic celebration on June 20 at 7:30 p.m.  This dance will be held at a hall in the park and is free.  Bruce Lowther and Judy will be our caller and cuer.  Arrive early and enjoy Brownsville's delicious BBQ chicken dinner.
