We congratulate our latest board members, President, Keith Miles; V-P, Anthony Egan; Secretary, Angie Clark; Treasurer, Cynthia Ekberg; State Delegate, Janet Bellcoff; and Alternate Delegate, Tami Helms.  Each won by unanimous acclamation.

This month&rsquo;s club to fold is the Recycles.  It befuddles us on why that club folded.  It would be easy to deduce that dancers don&rsquo;t like a plus and mixed rounds club; however, the biggest club in our council follows the same format and does very well.  And it would be easy to deduce that dancers won&rsquo;t dance any night but Saturday; however, one of our clubs has danced Wednesdays for 50 years, and is also doing well.  Informal discussions continue on cause and effect.  It does seem apparent, however, that there are not enough dancers left to support all our clubs.  Clubs will need to change with the times to attract new dancers and retain the old.  Hopefully, those changes will not conflict.
