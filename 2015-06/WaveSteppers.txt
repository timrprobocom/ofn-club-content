One change in the Wave Steppers&rsquo; 2015 dance schedule&mdash;the club&rsquo;s September 12 dance will be called by Daryl Kalmbach, with line dance coach Gwen Kiel.  September is the club&rsquo;s anniversary; according to old (and sometimes sketchy) records, there&rsquo;s been a square dance club in Garibaldi going back to the early 1900s.
 Saturday, June 13 is the club&rsquo;s famous Elvis Dance, with caller Mark Wheeler as Elvis, and round dancing with cuer Connie Clark.
 The Wave Steppers will hold a Patriotic Dance on Saturday, July 11, with George Clark calling and Cueing.  Our Hawaiian Dance Saturday, August 8, will feature Harvey Hunsucker as caller and cuer.
 Club caller Joe Wrabek will call the Wave Steppers&rsquo; Fall Dance October 10, with Gwen Kiel conducting line dancing.  
 The Wave Steppers&rsquo; square dance classes, taught by club caller Joe Wrabek, continue every Wednesday evening at the Tillamook Elks Lodge, 1907 Third St. in downtown Tillamook.  The classes are free.
 All the club&rsquo;s dances are held the second Saturday of the month, on the Dance Floor at Garibaldi City Hall, 107 6th St. (one block off US 101).  The Garibaldi Inn and Suites, located half a block away, offers discounts for dancers spending the night.
