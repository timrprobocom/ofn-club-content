 Scandinavian Square Dancing.  That&rsquo;s what we did with KC Curtis in the month of April, as Bev Flint added flair and fun with her great cueing.  Thanks to the River City Dancers for bringing a large visitation from Milwaukie.  We had an energy filled dance hall with new and old friends.
 Our May dances had a Mexican travel theme.  I have never seen so many sombreros in a dance hall like that before.  The taco feed at our 2nd dance was a great success.  Those dinners before dances give us great energy to dance the night away.
 The Tri Squares gave us a special evening of dancing, laughing and making new friends on our May visitation.
 We are looking forward to traveling to Madagascar this month.  Hope you get to come to the dance in the Rainforest on June 19th. Watch out for those strange animals lurking in amongst the trees. 
 The Damons did an outstanding job for our Mystery trip on June 6th, never a dull moment for us.
 We welcome our new officers this month and are looking forward to a new year of square and round dancing opportunities. 
 See you in a square.
