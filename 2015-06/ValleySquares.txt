 Please join us for our annual Strawberry Dance June 6th and our regular club dance June 20th.
 If you want to put polishing touches on your Mainstream Dancing, we are offering a MS Workshop at 7 Tuesday nights throughout June.  Chuck Garner is instructing.  First class is June 2 and costs $6.
 Thanks to everyone who helped us celebrate our 66th Anniversary.  We hope the next year brings new people into dancing and strengthens one of the oldest clubs in the metropolitan area.
 We had a great crowd at our first dance in April - lots of Sunset Promenaders brought energy and fun to the floor.
