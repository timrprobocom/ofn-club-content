   June 6 is a Beginner Dance called by Roger Putzler.  We dance at the Emerald Dance Center at 2095 Yolanda in Springfield.  Cushioned wood floor and air conditioning.
     The beginner class has had as many as ten squares.  It varies from 5 - 8 squares now.  We do need more angels though and appreciate the ones who come Wednesday nights at 7:00.  Jim Voll does a great job of teaching.  It's just nice to see Jim and Joyce back into the swing of things.
     A number of our members helped clean the dance hall recently.  We didn't have enough folks to do the outside, but the inside looks very nice.  Larry Hampton painted a beautiful new board for Danebo Circle 8 which was put up during the cleaning.  It looks great from the outside of the hall since the windows were cleaned by David Lajoie and Kurt Jensen of Spin Cycle Squares.  Leah Firth was up there helping install the new board as well.  Leah is a Whirl-A-Way and learned rounds from Christina.  All clubs were involved with the cleaning. 
     The hall purchased three new heaters to replace the antiquated ones.  These are in the main hall and the kitchen.  A wise and sound investment for the dancers.
     We are dark in July.
Keep on dancing,
Christina Corelli
