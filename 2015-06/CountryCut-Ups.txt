Summer has finally come, and with it sunshine, strawberries, and Summer Festival. It is a time to dress casual, and occasionally dance outside. The Cut-Ups dance all year long in the Boring Barn on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Saturdays.

Richard Lane called at the boring Barn on May 2, to over five squares of dancers. His daughter was visiting and this is the first time she had heard him call a square dance. A lot of the Vancouver folks came over to support him. It was a lot of fun for everyone.

It is sad to see that more clubs have folded, mostly recently the Recycles and the Squaws and Paws. It is important that each of us support our own club, and the activity of square dancing in general. We need to be more creative in retaining students and keeping the activity fun for all ages. So get out there and dance, and speak up with any inspiration you come up with.
