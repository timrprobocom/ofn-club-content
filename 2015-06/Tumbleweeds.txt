The tumbleweeds have been very busy so far this year, as we dance 4 times a month and dance on the 5th Fridays it keeps us moving to the beat and having lots of fun.

Our elections are over and Doris Schnelle is our president, Carol Zellmer Vice President, Lela Harper treasure, Jerrie Rismoen Secretary and Verna France PAC delegate.

Our new board had their first meeting of their term and planning much more fun for the rest of the year. Our first dance in May brought us almost 5 squares.

May 8th is our mother's Day dance our theme is vintage attire.

June is shaping up to be a fun month with June 12th Elvis dance and some peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in honor of Elvis as his favorite sandwich.
