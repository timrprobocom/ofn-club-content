In honor of May Day, Willamette Squares danced around the Maypole at their recent dance. The colorful streamers were extra long this year so it took extended dancing time weaving over/under to get the ribbons all woven into place around the Maypole. Delicious snacks and finger foods were served and dancers enjoyed dancing to a variety of musical selections.  Jodee Howard
