As of April 30, our club changed the start time for dancing. Our new hours will be 6 p.m. to 7:20 p.m. for dancing, 7:30 p.m. to 8:20 p.m. for lessons, and 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. for the die hards to dance more. The last set of times will depend on who is still around or how many go home after the lessons. Each week will be dependent on how many people are still there.
     We are started Mambo lessons on May 7. By the time you read this, hopefully we are doing well and maneuvering around the floor in fine fashion.
     The big event of this month is the club&rsquo;s 39th birthday and the retirement recognition dance for Ray and Virginia Walz, who have given us many years of their time and instructions. We all dance better because we learned to dance intermediate rounds under their tutelage.  
      Ray and Virginia, from the club to you, THANK YOU!  We appreciate the friendship we have with you and will remain that way. You are welcome any time to join us and dance instead of teach. Marilyn Schmit
