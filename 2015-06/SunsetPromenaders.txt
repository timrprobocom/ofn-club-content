Come visit our club this month, we are having a Pie Night on June 20th which is always a good dance to come to.  Mike Stout and Ken Pratt, our Caller and Cuer, will be putting on a lively friendly dance for your pleasure.
 We now have 11-new dancers in our club; just graduated from class and hopefully will come dance with us regularly.  All of our students have joined our club and we had potluck dinner after their graduation to welcome them; they are a really nice group of people; the future of our club.  On the sad side, the Club is also having at least four couples that are leaving the club; one moving to Aurora, another to Bend, etc.  
 We had a visitation to the Toe Draggers this month with over a square going, and it was a fun dance, the Toes are really friendly dancers.
 Our Plus dances on 1st and 3rd Thursdays are really fun with Darrell Kalmbach calling and Ken Pratt cueing.  If you Plus dancers come to the dance we are sure you will enjoy it; give it a try.  We start at 7:00 and dance until 9:30 at the Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall, 267 E. Main St.
