 Rain, Rain go away...  All the dancers want to play.  R Square D started off the month of April celebrating 62 years of fellowship and dancing.  Visitors from Happy Hoppers, Fairway Village, Ruff and Ruffles and Cougar Squares joined us in the celebration.  We are gearing up for a Cowboy hats and boots Western Dance on the 25th. 
 R Square D thanks Dick and Sandy Sims for hosting the monthly meeting, lots of good discussion was had.   Thank You Toni Carroll for stepping up and taking over as lead for our yearly Oktoberfest Celebration.  
 We are looking forward to a visitation on June 6th to Cougar Squares Anniversary Dance. The club will be hosting an M & M dance on Wednesday June 10th, casual wear and on the 24th of July we will all be eating Strawberries at our Strawberry Dance.  July finds us having a freedom Dance on the 8th with root beer floats and the 22nd is our Denim Dance.   The warmth of August finds us enjoying a Hawaiian Dance on the 12th and our yearly back to school dance for the children on the 26th.
