We have two articles for you this month.  One describes the "Heaven Can Wait 5K" race
coming up in Bend.  The other is an article by Your Faithful Editor describing the process
of collecting club information for the Federation's state directory.  We see an awful
lot of mistaken and outdated information in the directory information.  Perhaps a
bit of background information will help explain why we go through this process every year.
<p>
This month has seen the demise of several clubs in the state (Columbia Gorge Plus,
Recycles, Squaws and Paws), but the addition of a new club in the TVC (Columbia River
Dancers).  Let's hope we can reverse that trend.

We have our first paid advertisement since going online this month.  Any feedback you
have is always welcome.
