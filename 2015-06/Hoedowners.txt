When I was a kid, my mother always said that thunder was the sound of the circus wagons crossing over a bridge.  Anyone hear thunder on April 11th when we held our &ldquo;Under the Big Top&rdquo; Dance?  The orange and white tent in the ballroom set the tone, while strong men, clowns, Spanish ladies, and lion tamers graced the floor.  There was popcorn and peanuts, hot dogs and circus cookies!  We heard a bit of calliope music while we danced.  The only thing missing was aerialist, maybe next year.
 Our Denim Dance is always a favorite as everyone has a bit of denim to wear.  For some of us it&rsquo;s a uniform.  The evening was relaxed……hmmmm as in relaxed fit jeans.  Who didn&rsquo;t undo the top button after the baked potato bar?  It was an enormous hit; more than a dozen toppings and deserts too. Everyone ate hardy and lingered after the dance; just what we love to see.
 As for June, we&rsquo;re looking forward to our Strawberries and Cream Dance on the 13th.  Fresh Oregon strawberries will be served and celebrated.  
 On the 27th, we&rsquo;re holding our first Dad&rsquo;s BBQ Dance.  Can you guess what we&rsquo;ll be serving?  Join us to celebrate all the Dads in our lives.
