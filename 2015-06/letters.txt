<p>
Calling all Square and Round Dancers in Central Oregon...
<p>
Again this year, we're going to have a "team" representing all dancers at the 
"Heaven Can Wait" 5K event on Sunday, June 7, 2015, at 9 AM, at Drake Park, 
in Bend.
<p>
You must register at <a href="http://heavencanwait.org">heavencanwait.org</a>
yourself and during that process, you'll have an opportunity to select a team.
Select "Central Oregon Square &amp; Round Dancers".  I, as Team Captain, will 
receive notification that you're walking with our team.  You'll also have the 
opportunity to purchase a T-shirt or Hat for additional cost.  The Council 
will supply a pink felt square we'll all wear on our back to designate us as 
Square/Round Dancers.  Also, I will be able to pick up everyone's registration 
material at Foot Zone in Bend so that not individuals will have to make that 
trip.   We will meet at Drake Park left of the Bridge in the park.
<p>
Last year we had over 25 dancers walking to benefit Breast Cancer Awareness 
for Sara's Project.  Let's beat last years numbers.!
<p>
If you have any questions, please email me, joycewelton@aol.com, or call 
541-923-8804.  Hope to see you on June 7th.
<p>

<li><a>Club Directory Information</a>
<div>
<p>
There are two times each year when the Federation asks its clubs and
councils to fill out information and pay fees.  One time is the annual
insurance process in October.  The other time is the state directory
process, going on right now.  I would like to spend a few paragraphs
here to tell you what information we collect, how we collect it, why we
collect it, and why you should be careful when entering it.
<p>
The state directory information is entered on the same pages you use to
update your OFN information, at http://squaredance.gen.or.us/ClubInfo/ .
The information we ask for includes the type of dances you hold
(mainstream, plus, rounds, etc), when and where you hold your regular
dances, when and where you hold your lessons, contact information for
your club officers, contact information for your caller and cuer,
your tax exempt status, information about your special dances, and
your number of members.  When you finish entering the data on the
various pages, a copy of your updated information gets mailed to
the 2nd Vice President, who uses it to produce the state directory.
We ask you to enter this information in May, after you have held your
new officer elections.  We collect all of it into a single document,
which gets printed and distributed at the September state meeting.
(Because the printing process is more efficient now than it used to be,
there is talk of changing the deadline to August.)
<p>
The information is used in several other ways.  All of the data is stored
in a central database, and several sections of the Federation’s web
page are generated automatically from that database, including the club
directory and the lesson directory.  Google searches for square dancing
in Oregon lead to our club directory, so it’s important to make sure
your contact information is accurate.
<p>
The state directory has always been a printed publication.  At the last
state meeting, the executive board voted to start including an online
version of the state directory on our web site.  When that happens,
any updates you make will be available immediately, instead of having
to wait until September.
<p>
One thing some clubs may not realize is that this information is also used
for any official Federation communication.  Our constitution requires
that, when we need to have a vote of all of clubs (for constitution
or by-law changes, or for the annual election of officers), those
ballots must be sent to the club secretary as recorded in the database.
Every year, some clubs do not receive their ballots because of inaccurate
or outdated contact information for their club secretary.
<p>
I am always amazed at how many people do not know how to spell their
city name, or their caller’s name, or their dance hall’s address,
or their zip code, or their email addresses.  We spend a great deal
of time proofreading and correcting the directory information, and
that job is getting more taxing now that information is being updated
throughout the year.  Please, folks, take a little time to double-check
the information before you enter it, and check it again after you type it.
<p>
Recently, a special situation has come up that deserves mention.  There
are people who, for legal reasons, have protective orders that mean they
cannot have their contact information appear in public.  We certainly
want those people to be able to volunteer for their square dance clubs.
This question has arisen specifically in relation to online availability,
but the fact is that the printed directory is also a public document.
If this issue comes up, you should enter their names, but no address
or email.  If we need to reach these folks, we can go through another
officer.
