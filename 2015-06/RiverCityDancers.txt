Our Mystery Trip was definitely an adventure.  A scavenger hunt, dinner in the Portland Ala Carts Food Vendors and wrapping up the evening with the Squaws and Paws for their last dance.  What a great evening and even the weather co-operated. 
 
We will celebrate our 25th Anniversary on June 20th.  Twenty five years ago the Barn Owls and Rose City Squares merged and became River City Dancers.  Les Seeley as caller and Tami Helms as cuer have been the hub of our wheel and we do love them.
 
We recently lost two past members that were instrumental in the success of our club.
 
Dick Palan and his wife Jeanette were originally Rose City Squares.  They were members of the teams from each club that worked to form a smooth transition.  They were the second President of the club.  They also lived near the dance hall and were the caretakers of the building.  Dick recently passed away.
 
Kathy Buczkowski and her husband Buzz were originally Barn Owls.  Kathy served several terms as Secretary.  Around the early 2000's they retired to their home in Gleneden Beach.  They continued to square and round dance and joined the Toledo 49ers.  Kathy was active at many festivals and both National Conventions in Portland in the Sewing Clinics.  Kathy also recently passed away.
 
On the brighter side, we look forward to fun activities this summer, as well as great dancing.  Come join us.
 
Gail Domine (and Gimpy Al)
