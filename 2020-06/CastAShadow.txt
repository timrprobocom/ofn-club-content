We have not had any dances since February nor do we know when we will be able to start dancing again.   Please go to our website at CAS-SD.yolasite.com to check for possible dates.  Please remember to call before driving into dance with us as we cannot always guarantee we'll be dancing if a poll taken the week before doesn't show enough interest.

We mostly dance from 2-4PM on Sundays, twice a month at the Emerald square Dance Center in Springfield at 2095 Yolanda in Hall B behind the building which faces Yolanda.  We welcome all dancers who can dance at the A-1-A2 level.  Sometimes we have a live caller but most of the time we dance to recorded tips.  It is always a lot of fun.
