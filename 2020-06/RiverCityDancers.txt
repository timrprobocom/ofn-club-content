I am sure we all share the same hope and dreams of ending this pandemic and getting back on the dance floor again. I pray that the day will come when this pandemic is over and it is safe to gather and dance again. Until then We hope you are all staying well and healthy. Keep your chin up.  We will get through this.

Due to state wide restrictions, all of our dances and activities have been cancelled from March â€˜till at least July 6. We will have to wait until the state restrictions are lifted before we can dance again. As soon as we know, we will post this on our web site. 

Meanwhile we are preparing for the day we open wide the doors to welcome you all back.  These preparations include repairs and prettying up our hall., Ceilings and lights have been replaced in basement, restrooms, stairwell, foyer and coat room.  Both bathrooms have been repainted.  Two worn areas of our ballroom floor have been refinished and everything has had a good cleaning. 

We are ready to welcome you all when that day comes. Meanwhile stay well.
