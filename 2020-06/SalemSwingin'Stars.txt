As of this moment we are still dark for the foreseeable future.  We are hoping to be able to do something, anything in June but it is not up to us at this point in time.

As far as we know, none of our club members have contracted the dreaded virus.  We are staying in touch, staying home and hopefully staying sane. We are looking to the future with hopeful expectation that dancing will once again be the highlights of our week. Until then, Yellow Rocks all around. Sheila Machado
