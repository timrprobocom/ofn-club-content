I hope everyone has stayed healthy.  Not much to report for the Charlies. Another month shut down and missing dancing!!

Now that we are in Phase 1 of reopening,  there might be a chance of dancing before the end of summer, but we just don't know yet. We miss everyone and hope to be back dancing soon.

Just in case, our currently scheduled dances for June are: June 6th Gumdrops & Yo-Yo's dance with J Domis & Bob Dingman.  Pre-rounds at 7pm and MS/Plus at 730. June 20th Soda Shoppe Hop with Chuck Simpkins & Mark McDonald. Please keep an eye out for updates on https://charliebrownsquares.com/  and the Charlie Brown Facebook page!!

Late breaking update -- the Charlies have voted to cancel all June dances.  We will try again in July.

We were disappointed to have to cancel Boatnik, but look forward to 2021 with Jet Roberts & Rey(Sherry) Gomez and will look forward to booking Bronc Wise and Peter(Chama) Gomez for a future festival!!

Hang in there and we look forward to getting back to dancing!!
