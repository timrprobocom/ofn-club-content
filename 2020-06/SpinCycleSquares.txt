One of our members is moving to Wisconsin to be close to his family.  We had a socially distanced gathering on a Sunday at the hall's parking lot.  We parked six vehicles in a ginormous circle with the tailgates facing in.  Patrick Finn drove down from Lebanon with his dog, Molly.  It was a nice couple of hours to share and send Patrick off to Wisconsin with good wishes and virtual hugs.  And, it was wonderful to see people too.
