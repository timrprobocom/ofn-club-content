We are now dark for the summer with our next regularly planned dance to be held in September.

Our competition youth went ahead and drew for their cash raffle winners, who are: Carson Clews, Sandra Thomas and Jean Goul. Thank you to all who bought raffle tickets from the kids this year. They really appreciate the support.

We are still in the process of picking a new club caller - harder to discuss and decide via emails. Hope to be out dancing again soon. Petrina Buchheit
