 Two of the TVC clubs, Eager Beavers and Hoedowners, were co-sponsoring the 2020 Oregon State Festival with the Oregon Federation to be held in Seaside on August 21-23.  Unfortunately the Festival has been officially cancelled.  This decision was based on the guidelines put forth by the Governor of the State of Oregon.  Oregon Governor Kate Brown announced on May 7th that all large gatherings, including festivals, conventions, and fairs, will not be allowed through at least September, until the state has access to a vaccine or reliable treatment for COVID-19.
 In keeping with the social distancing guidelines, the TVC dance which was to be held at the Kinton Grange on May 30th has been cancelled.
 The TVC and the TVC clubs have been active in ways other than dancing, getting together via Zoom, phone calls, and newsletters.  Many have volunteered their services sewing masks for donation to care facilities.
 We also held elections via email.  Taking office in June will be: President - Mike St.Clair;  Vice President - Jan Amerson; Secretary - Andis Garuts; Treasurer - Tammy Leblanc; and State Delegate - Josie Rosenbury.
 Some of our member club dancers have found a way to continue dancing, at least dancing for one couple.  There are currently five mp3 files available for download from https://buddyweavermusic.podbean.com/
 I hope every one is doing well.
