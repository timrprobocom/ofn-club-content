     Glory Be -- We held our elections by mail.  Never mind our council not having any constitutional provision to do so.  In this day and age, one needs to be flexible!  Parliamentarian Jeff Knapp conducted the election.

     Our new President will be Robert Lumsden and V-P will be Tami Helms.  The rest of the crew remains the same:  Treasurer, Jeff Knapp; Secretary, Eileen Petticrew; State Delegate, Betty Chips; Alt Delegate Tami Helms.

     The rumor mill has it that Robert has big plans for us, and so does our very popular cuer, Tami.

     According to my predication, the first club to begin dancing will be our Tumbleweeds.  This is because they usually have only one square dancing (which is why they might be the first club to dance).  Now just imagine what it would be like to have a couple hundred dancers show up for their first dance, and fill their coffer?  Oh, their caller, cuer and president would swoon, not to mention their treasurer.  Well, maybe later this year?

     And if we get too stir crazy, perhaps a flash mob?  Weâ€™ll have to figure out the social distancing in case the police get there before we disband.  Back in the day, callers used to tell us to tighten up our square; now they may tell us to loosen our square!
