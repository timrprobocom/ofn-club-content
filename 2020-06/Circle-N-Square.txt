Greetings from Yreka.
  I assume that we, like you are on hiatus from square dancing. I also assume like us, that you miss your square dance friends. Due to the on going guidelines set for social distancing, and Covid-19 We will be canceling our annual Gold Diggers dance. With schools remaining closed we were not able to get the usage of Evergreen School. At this point, we are hoping that our county fair will still be held. If the fair does go as scheduled then we will have our "Pepsi Booth" at the fair, we also have a dance at the fair as a demo and promotion for upcoming classes, so we hope the fair goes as planned. We hope every one stays safe, strong, and in touch with family and friends. I am confident that in time, this to shall pass. We will keep you updated as we get info and as things get back to normal.
Hope to see you soon 
Dean
