 The Toe Draggers, in a nod to reality, have canceled all dances through the end of August.  We also had to cancel our progressive dinner and our summer campout. Suddenly, our social calendars are wide open.
 We had our business meeting by Zoom this week, and it worked pretty well.  It was nice to see everyons's faces.
