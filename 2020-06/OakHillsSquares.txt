 As with everyone else, we are experiencing social distancing, and dances are cancelled until further notice.  In the meantime, Oak Hills Squares members are busy helping neighbors and friends, completing projects at home, and MANY are walking the 2-mile loop around the neighborhood daily, where we can chat a bit when meeting en route.  Several members have been making masks for the local hospital, and for a retirement home where one of our members is employed.
 Our club secretary, Anne Scott, organized a Zoom meeting for us last week.  More than fifteen of us participated, some wearing masks for fun (including one military gas mask!), our club shirts, and badges.  It was fun hearing about what everyone is doing.  It was such a success that another Zoom meeting is planned soon.  Our board will also have a virtual meeting via Zoom for May.
 Lane has been keeping us entertained with weekly emails directing us to fun dancing websites.  The latest showed three different dances with calls for one couple!  We tried it out, and it was great!
 Everyone stay safe; we look forward to that first dance after this hiatus!
