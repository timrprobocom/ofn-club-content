We missed calling and cueing for the Emerald Empire's annual benefit dance the end of May.  This year it was for Food for Lane County.  We hope to be back to calling, cueing and dancing this fall.  Our next scheduled 5th Saturday CCCA Dance is August 29, 2020, but we'll have to wait and see if it is even feasible to have that dance.  We err on the side of caution.  This virus business is just too scary to dismiss or think about lightly.  Then, the next scheduled 5th Saturday dance after that  is Halloween, October 31.  We've had the 31st fall on a Saturday before and have had fun dances with costumes and spooky music for rounds and squares.
