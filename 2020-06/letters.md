title: Seaside Sashay

Greetings from the Seaside Sashay Committee,

We are set up with a great Sashay planned for this year, however, with the “Stay Home, Stay Safe” order we all are currently experiencing we are proceeding cautiously.   October 23 & 24th of this year is the planned date and we know the Calling team of Ray Brendzy and Richard Lane are wildly popular with many dancers attending because of their talent.  Also, Debbie Taylor, our Cuer,  is a huge draw for all the round dancers who attend the Sashay.   We will be making a decision about holding our event based on conditions later this year.  We want to ensure the health of all our dancers as well as all the people we interact with in Seaside.  Also, we have to know that businesses will be open and ready with all the services our dancers need.

Most of the businesses in Seaside are temporarily closed right now so putting together  the program book as well as the Passport Promenade is not possible.  Our committee is working on solving these and other challenges to make this, our 20th annual Seaside Sashay as sensational as always.  

We welcome your continued registrations but will not send out ribbons until later this year.  We hope by mid-August we will be able to gauge the situation and make a decision.  We hope to bring you a wonderful, affordable weekend of fun in October 2020.  

We have distributed registration forms to many clubs in Oregon and Washington but if you don’t have access to one, contact us and we can send a registration form via e-mail or snail mail to you.  
Our e-mail address is gaclark42@gmail.com  or you can call us at 503-647-5742 or 503-310-3538.

We will continue to work to make the 20th Annual Seaside Sashay the best one ever, we hope you will all attend.
