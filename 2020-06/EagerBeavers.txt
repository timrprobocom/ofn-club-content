 March 9th was the last time we were able to dance.  When we have another dance is a question for which we have no good answer.  We hold on to hope, keep calm, and carry on until the good times roll again.  I think when we start the callers should give us refresher lessons.  I think I am forgetting everything I ever learned.  Look and you will see I wrote “when” not “if”.  There is a future for us. 
 I have called a few of our members to learn how they are coping without dancing.  Everyone is missing their regular contact time talking as well as the time dancing.  I learned I should be calling more.  Everyone I called seemed to be glad to hear a familiar voice asking how they were doing.  You also hear some good stories.  Some of us do things we have never tried before.  I did ZOOM for the first time!
 We were electing our officers remotely on May 4th.  Our new slate of officers are President Sally Duyck, Vice President Ferrous & Karen Steinka, Secretary Judy Martin, Treasurer Mike Duyck, Delegates Leslie Tallman and Alice Hendricks.
 Keep your eye on the OFN news.  I am sure there will be headlines when it is deemed it is safe to resume contact sports such as ours.  Right now please stay 6 feet from me and stay healthy.  I want to be dancing with you in the future.
 The following message is for your information when life as we used to know begins again: We dance on most holidays.  Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 p.m. - 3:00, at the Aloha Grange, 3425 SW 185th, Beaverton, 97006.  Please check for up to date information at www.EagerBeavers.info.
