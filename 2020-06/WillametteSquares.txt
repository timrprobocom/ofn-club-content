I have no new news. I have not heard from anyone in our club, but I am assuming everyone is taking precautions and that no one has come down with the virus. I myself have been sick with an acute case of bronchitis and a concussion from a fall that fractured my skull. I am still in recovery mode. Hope you are well. Jodee
