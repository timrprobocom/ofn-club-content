 In April we were supposed to have our annual general meeting with elections and dinner out, but with the pandemic of course that couldn't happen.  So we did nominations and elections by email.  Our new officers are:  President - Dale Brabham;  Vice President - Gloria Davis;  Secretary - John Prouty;  Treasurer - Edith Prouty;  Dance Coordinator - Lynnea Loveberg;  TVC Reps - no volunteers yet.  
 We continue to have our monthly board meetings over Zoom.  You know, I feel we are very lucky to live in our two beautiful states, with no hurricanes, tornadoes, stifling humidity, etc.  Plus we have several months of nice weather to be outdoors, even if we're just walking in the neighborhood.  So lucky in this way.  But we must keep social-distancing, because the more we do that the sooner we can get back to square dancing.  I find inspiration myself by listening to Governor Cuomo's daily press briefings (CNN approx. 8:30am, 30 minutes) because he takes it step-by-step and gives me hope.  And if he can handle 19 million people in New York City plus the people upstate, then we as Oregonians and Washingtonians can handle this, like our ancestors handled the wars and pandemics and the Great Depression before us.  Stay safe, and stay apart from each other - even though we hate that - to make it sooner that we'll all be dancing together again.  One step at a time.
