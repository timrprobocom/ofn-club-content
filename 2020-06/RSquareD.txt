 Dear Dancers,  The last dance we had was on March 13th and was surprisingly successful, before Social Distancing really kicked in.  We had 3 squares dancing.  Jim Raupp was guest caller for this B51 dance, a wonderful opportunity for new dancers to experience what we all know:  that square dancing is fun and worth the learning.  It will keep up their anticipation for more dances after this time of social distancing is behind us.
 Decisions for new officers have been made.  Our new leader for the coming year is Chris Poole who will take the helm as our President,  Marv Pope for VP,  Pat Faires as Treasurer, and Judy Howland Secretary.  It will be an interesting season for Chris'  reign.
 Well, dear friends, there won't be anything to report for awhile so, please adhere to safety guidelines so that we will meet again in a square soon.  For current information see: www.r-square-d.info.
