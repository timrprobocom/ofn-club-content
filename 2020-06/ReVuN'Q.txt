Hi everyone. I think all of us are ready to get back to dancing sooner rather than later. 
As President of the club, I have tried to send out an email about every two weeks to see how everyone is doing and to keep them updated on what is happening with the clubâ€™s business transactions. 

I sent out an email with a slate of officers and asked for approval from the paid membership so we could complete the Club Info form on the Federation website. That has been completed and the Corporation Division bill has been paid. So business continues even though we are not dancing soon until the Governor opens up the state more. 

Hope you are all doing well and are ready to get back to dancing very soon. Marilyn Schmit
