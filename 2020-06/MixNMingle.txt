 The M&M’s will be dark this summer from June 20th thru September 5th.  We will start up again (fingers crossed for mandates to be lifted) on September 20th.  Our Red, White and Blue Dance, scheduled for June 6th, was to be our last hurrah before summer but it, too, is most likely canceled due to social distancing.  I guess we’ll have to find another way to ring in the Summer!
 We will keep you updated on calendar changes thru this OFN report as well as our website:  www.mixandminglesquares.org
