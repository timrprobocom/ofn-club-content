Our last dance was our birthday dance Feb. 14 when we celebrated 56 years of dancing in Eugene and Springfield.  We all miss getting together and dancing twice a month on the 2nd and 4th Fridays.  We miss our callers, our cuer and our fellow dancers.  There is no way to tell when we will once again be able to enjoy our "contact sport".  Meanwhile we urge everyone to stay safe by practicing social distancing and wearing masks and gloves when out in public.  We may at some point try dancing with masks and gloves to see how it might work.

We do hope to be back to dancing by next September at which point we expect to be dancing only once a month on the 4th Fridays at the Emerald Square Dance Center at 20th and Yolanda from 7:30 to 10:00, starting with plus at 7:30 and mainstream from 8-10:00PM.  Once we can all get back to dancing it will be a blast to see all our friends once again.

Stay safe,
Gaynor Hintz
