Not much to report from CCC. To my knowledge thus far, we have all avoided the virus. We haven’t met to dance since the end of March and we are all missing it deeply, but we do have the ability to practice at home by going to YouTube or our website. 

From what I am hearing from the Governor’s report, we may not be dancing until sometime in September. That being said, our demo season will be on hold as well since many of our venues have now been cancelled.  Not sure if we'll have a beginner’s class in September or not as many of our new people come from the demos we are able to do during the summer. Georganne Pfnister
