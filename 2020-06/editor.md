I don't think any dances were held in May.  Some counties are slowly opening up, but it's not clear anything will happen in June, either.  Stay healthy, and we'll get back to normal sooner or later.

Be sure to check on your club members once in a while.  Since we're not seeing everyone regularly, it can get very lonely.
