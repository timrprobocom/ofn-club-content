We are still not dancing and don’t anticipate being able to dance until the Governor lifts some of the restrictions on gatherings due to the pandemic which may not happen until most of the population has had a chance to get vaccinated.  It could well be we’ll need some make up lessons to get back in stride!  Most of us are champing at the bit to start up again but will continue to play it safe.
Hope everyone is doing likewise and looking forward to dancing once again in the new year--perhaps by next spring.
