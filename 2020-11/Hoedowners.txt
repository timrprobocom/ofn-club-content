This month’s Hoedowner report will be brief.  If nothing else, these past few months with the pandemic have taught me is to expect the unexpected.  I wish I were reporting on our annual fall Dinner Out when the Hoedowners typically get together for a nice evening out, catch up on everyone’s summer adventures and prepare for fall lessons.  I wish I were telling you all about our new students and how quickly they were learning.  
 Instead I’m telling you what I’ve learned in the last month; staying home for Covid-19 is has been a depressing experience but staying home and staying in because thousands of acres of Oregon and the entire west coast are burning was unexpectedly depressing.  The bonfire smell we enjoy on the beach or on a camping trip wasn’t as pleasant when it filled our homes. The smoke made for great sunsets but eventually we couldn’t see the house across the street. Our eyes were burning, and throats were scratchy, but the tragedy was being played out elsewhere where homes, business, neighborhoods, and entire towns burned.  If the folks in Detroit, Phoenix and other cities and neighborhoods can regroup and start again, we can too and I will stop complaining, and count my blessings. 
 The Aloha Grange is going to sponsor another family this year for Christmas just like they always do so keep that in mind.  I don’t know when we’ll square up next, but I’ll be waiting to see you across the square, smiling back at me.
