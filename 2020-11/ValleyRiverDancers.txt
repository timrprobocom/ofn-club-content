While square dancing is still suspended for Valley River Dancers, our Cuer, Leonard Snodgrass has been teaching Waltz round dance lessons so that our new members have been able to learn and recently started cha-cha lessons following the waltz classes.  Due to the COVID19 restrictions these lessons are limited to couples only and the number of couples in order to maintain safe distancing. 
 It is good to keep connections and we look forward to returning to dances when it is safe.
