November is here and the M&M’s are turning 36.  This year, unfortunately, we won’t be wishing ourselves a happy birthday by dancing in a festive hall decorated with puffy handmade M&M pillows (thanks, Mom), or having a contest to see who can guess how many M&M’s are in the jars, or dancing our hearts out to our dynamic duo Randy & Jeanine. 
 We can, however, take time to reflect on our history and remember how we got to where we are today.  We can think about all the great club callers, club cuers and numerous “guests” who graced our stage over the years.  We can remember all the good times dancing together, the fun club activities that were organized and the great lifelong friends that have been made.  We can, even in this pandemic,  celebrate!  Although we aren't a new young club anymore and we don't have the 80+ membership that we did on that long ago November 3rd night, we, who remain dedicated to the M&M’s, are still here after 36 years. We have a great home at the Winona Grange, and we are part of a wonderful square dance family.
 And of then course, we can always have cake....,  and if you have a piece of cake (or favorite dessert) sometime this month, you can consider yourself celebrating with us!  After all, it is a birthday and you can never go wrong with cake.  
 We will keep you updated on calendar changes thru this OFN report as well as our website:  www.mixandminglesquares.org
