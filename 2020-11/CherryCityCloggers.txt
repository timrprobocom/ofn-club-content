There is still not much going on with the Cherry City Cloggers. Anyone clogging is doing so by going to YouTube and getting instruction there. 

Mary Ellen, our President, did a remarkable job of putting together a newsletter for us all. She had members send her pictures of things they had been doing during the past few months to maintain their sanity, along with a short explanation of the pictures. It was really great catching up on what others had been doing as well as a great way to bring us all together in a time where we can't be together physically.  Well done Mary Ellen!
