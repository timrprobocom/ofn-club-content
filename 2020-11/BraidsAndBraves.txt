We continue to meet about every other month, both in person (with masks and social distancing) and virtually. This month we will be discussing Callerlab's 'Sustainable Square Dancing'. Hopefully other clubs are, too. It is in response to the complaints that classes take too long so people lose interest. Stay healthy, friends, until we meet again in a square.
