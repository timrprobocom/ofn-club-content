Well, here it is a few months into my 12th year as TVC Editor for the OFN and I find that I have virtually nothing to say!  Many of my reporters are in the same boat but several are finding something to report.  For that I want to express my profound thanks.  We are in a difficult time for our square dance activity and it does not appear that it will end soon.
 For a "blast from the past", here is an excerpt of the TVC report from November 2009....
 Thank you to the Coast Swingers for serving as hosts for the State Meeting Dinner and Dance at Garibaldi.  It was a huge success, having over 100 people in attendance.  The Officer/Delegate meeting was held on Saturday afternoon. The Coast Swinger’s had a dance that evening and the State meeting was held on Sunday.  All of this activity and it proceeded without a hitch.  The Coast Swinger's did an absolutely fantastic job.
 Another past highlight was our annual Hahn Barn Dance.  Sunny skies and warm breezes greeted the dancers as they arrived to mingle and enjoy the potluck before the dance.  Donna Byars and Vivian Fairburn greeted and signed in about 11 squares who danced to the calling & cueing of Harold Kleve and George Clark.  Congratulations to the Sunset Promenaders, who won the “Most In Attendance” TVC Banner. 
 Previous Oregon State Goodwill Ambassador (2007), Genevieve Churchill, will turn 98 on November 22nd!  Genevieve, an active member of multiple clubs, can be found dancing Monday's with the Eager Beavers as well as other clubs in the area.  
 The report ended with a reminder of the upcoming TVC’s New Year’s Eve Dance held at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro. The Caller was to be Bob Ewing and Cuer, Connie Clark. The cost was $12.00 per person, which included a pre-dance dinner and dancing until after midnight.
 Remember when we danced until or after midnight?
