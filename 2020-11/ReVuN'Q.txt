Our club continues to do well on Thursdays with the new Bolero lessons. We started with about 7.5 couples and we are now up to about 10 couples per week. We are growing in attendance and the friendship is wonderful to watch. 
We are talking about a special dance sometime in November but are waiting for more input from the dancers for a date and time. Stay tuned for information and a flyer with the necessary details.
We will need to start negotiations with our cuer to see where we stand as of January 1. We would like to have him continue past that date but will wait to see what the status of his program in the Beaverton/Hillsboro area is and if he wishes to continue with our club.
Thanksgiving is around the corner and we give grateful thanks to the dancers who are supporting our club and continue to come and dance with us weekly.
