We are continuing to rent the parking lot at the dance hall for a short visit on Sundays. We back our vehicles in a huge circle and either sit on our tailgates or bring a lawn chair. We can visit and see each other and maintain a safe distance. It works.  
Tim Matteson's mom is not doing well.  Tim is our caller.  Our hope is for Tim's mom to regain health and strength soon.
Stay safe and healthy,
