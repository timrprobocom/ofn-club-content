The Promenaders had their yearly campout planned for the Lincoln City area on the second weekend.  Clay & Kelly McCaw found some openings in Castle Rock Washington at the Toutle Resort RV Park. They met with Donna Evers, a past Promenader who now lives and dances in Rainer area.  Judy Schnase and Floyd Wolf showed up for a day.  The traditional taco lunch was served, trails were explored and a game of farkle with outdoor dice ensued. 
 We will be having a remote club meeting at our regular meeting time on to discuss if there will be any November functions.
 Thank you, 
  Dan Browning
