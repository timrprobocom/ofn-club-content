Well, it seems some of the clubs around are venturing into dancing - modified of course.  The Star Promenaders are going to attempt a "Peaceful Demonstration" in November.  If we have a dance, we are limited to the number of people who can attend. If we demonstrate, the attendance is unlimited - GO figure.
Plans are moving ahead for 2021 Diamond Lake. They aren't moving very fast, but they are coming along. The featured caller and cuer are Ray Brendzy and his family and Christina Corelli. Should be a great combination.
Come on out and join us.
See you in a square
