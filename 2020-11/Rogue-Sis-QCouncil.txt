As COVID-19 numbers continue to rise, we are hopeful to proceed forward with our activities.  The numbers have been low down here, so we might be able to start slowly dancing with a few squares at a time.  Round dance lessons start up at the Star Promenaders Hall in October.  They will be following the guidelines for COVID-19 regulations.

The council has cancelled our October 30th, 5th Friday dance, but we hope to have the PajamaRama Dance in January.  We look forward to seeing everyone dance in their pajamas.  COVID-19 has affected our activity but not our spirits.  We have begun having our club and council meetings again.  Star Promenaders had a small but fun dance using all the COVID-19 requirements of social distancing, contact information, and good hand hygiene. Dancing with 2 foot pool noodles may be a challenge, but it was a challenge that several dancers wanted to conquer.  We had 2 squares of square dancers come together and dust up our dancing skills, and the caller, Phil Ramey, was kind enough to keep it basic for the first dance since March.  Everyone kept their social distancing, wearing face masks or face shields, hand washing stations used by all, noodles disinfected between tips, bring your own treats and drinks, and enjoy the fellowship.  Each couple received the same color noodles(green, yellow, blue, lime, orange, tan, etc) and squared up.  Each noodle was disinfected before they could be used again.  All COVID regulations were looked up, researched, and followed.

Pear Blossom for 2021 is still planning to go ahead with the festival the 2nd weekend in April.  We will keep you updated with any changes. Please plan to attend.  Boatnik is also planning a wonderful festival Memorial Weekend in May.
