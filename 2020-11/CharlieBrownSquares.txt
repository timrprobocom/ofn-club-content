The Charlie Brown Squares are still waiting to get back to dancing ---we are really missing everyone!!!!  We are extremely sad that we've had to cancel so many wonderful events; and they just keep coming.  We have cancelled all events thru the end of 2020 - this includes our Birthday Dance in December that was scheduled with Randy Dibble.  We've got him back on the schedule in 2022; as next year (2021) we have the wonderful Pat Carnathan already scheduled for our birthday dance!!  Hoping that 2021 can get back to "normal" as we have so many wonderful dances scheduled!!!  This includes an entire weekend with Mike Seastrom in Oct 2021~~see flyer!!  The Boatnik Festival is going to be a great time Memorial Weekend with the wonderful Jet Roberts & Rey (Sherry) Garza!!
We hope everyone is doing well and that we will see you soon and/or when we can get back to dancing!!
