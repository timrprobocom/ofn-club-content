Hello from Hopper-Land!  We hope everyone is weathering this extended bout of isolation.  We are all doing our best to stay positive and connected.  Our next board meeting will be Wednesday November 11 at 7pm via Zoom.  It will be the first meeting since the summer.  Not sure what we have to discuss but it will be good to see faces and reconnect with the board.  Tom and Liza Halpenny have been doing a really great service by putting on zoom meetings every Monday evening.   During those meetings we've had the pleasure of dancing to Jim Hattrick's recordings of squares for one couple.  Also, Tom and Liza continue to teach some line dances and folk dances which get us all moving and usually laughing as well.  It's now tradition for folks to bring a joke or two to the meeting.  Groans abound but it's all in good fun.  Some of us asked if Jim would record some round dance cues and he agreed.  So, we have more to look forward to.  Jim has also been sitting in on the zoom meetings to see how things are going.  Thank you, Jim!  

So, as always, stay safe but stay active and we'll meet again some day!
