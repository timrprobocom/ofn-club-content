 Our club is still having board meetings, bimonthly on Zoom, and it is nice to check in with each other.  This last meeting was only 30 minutes because there's so little business.  But we did come up with an idea, to reach out to all club members and have a monthly virtual square dance chat, so to speak.  That is, to gather together on Zoom, and then break into small groups on Zoom (apparently you can do this) and then scramble the groups up again, so you can chat with different people.  Kind of like different squares in a square dance?  Maybe?  Anyway, we're giving it a try!  We will probably give these chatty get-togethers a monthly theme to go with holidays, like our dances did.  Hope the rest of you stay safe and stay social, the best you can - and exercise!
