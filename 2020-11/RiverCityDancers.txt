We hope everyone is staying safe and well. We are all in this together and look forward to the day that it will be safe for us to be square dancing and socializing once again. 

Here at River City Dancers, our board meets virtually on Zoom.  Our club also is holding social get together chats on Zoom twice a month just to check on one another. 

Until we can meet again in a square, stay well, keep your hopes up and your dancing shoes ready.
