Like most of the clubs in Oregon we are not dancing but will again as soon as it is safe to do so.  Since we were unable to muster much interest in a picnic this past July or August we decided to hold a simple get together at Suzanne Peterson’s country property where we could practice social distancing and wear masks or not as we pleased.  Everyone brought their own lawn chair and snacks, and we sat in a large circle to chat and catch up with what one another have been doing.  We had 22 members and guests, including the hosts, Suzanne and Renee and our club president and his wife, Larry and Carol Reetz.
Larry tells us they are moving into town on River Road in the month of October.  They won’t have such a long commute to the hall for dances and meetings.  We wish them well getting settled in.
There are a few pictures of our September get-together elsewhere in this issue.
One of our members is in rehab right now (Oct. 11) but will be out on the 14th.  Marguerite Zolman suffered a mild stroke and has some weakness in her left side.  We wish her well soon.
Stay healthy, everyone.
