Several IWW members participated in a “noodle” dance recently. The dancers each held ½ a pool noodle so they were able to keep a distance from each other and there was no touching. It was held outdoors and limited to two squares. The reports were that it was a lot of fun.
Some members are working on setting up line dancing lessons. They will be able to keep socially distant but still participate in a fun activity. The big advantage to line dancing is you don’t need a partner. I did it years ago and really enjoyed it.
