Many of our clubs have not met in several months.  I suppose we all have provisions to keep our clubs going.  In our case, the committee heads simply conduct the club business with our best judgement.  (It’s amazing how fast decisions can be made by not waiting to consult a board, snicker.)

     We’ve suspended dues as we don’t have the nerve to ask members for dues to a dance club that doesn’t dance.  No dues also saves a lot of time and paperwork.
