The Hayshakers are dreaming about dancing again someday. In the meanwhile weâ€™re studying Taminations.
 We like Scoot Back and want to do it from a Quarter Tag position where all 8 of us are trailers ending in a Three-quarter Tag position.
 Some Hayshakers dance Plus and enjoy Following Our Neighbors modeled on Scoot Back where everyone turns three-quarters instead one-half.  Right-hand waves become left-hand waves, so we frequently Spread to make right-hand waves again since left-hand waves are difficult.
