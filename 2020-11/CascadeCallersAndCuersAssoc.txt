Our next scheduled dance was supposed to be October 31, but with the coronavirus/COVID-19 still active and growing, especially in Lane County, there are no scheduled square and round dance activities through October.

We have heard that there will be no Buccaneers Plus or Mainstream or round dance classes for the remainder of 2020.

Buccaneers will not sponsor the New Year's Eve dance as previously scheduled.
We trust everyone is doing what they can to be safe and that everyone is well and healthy.

Our hall in Springfield was closed around March 9 and will remain closed until further notice.

You can never be too safe with this virus business.
Wishing you all good health,
Christina Corelli, Secretary
