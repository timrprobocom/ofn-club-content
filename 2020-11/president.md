It’s a strange year to find myself President of the Federation.  I expected to be traveling the State and enjoying all your club dances, festivals and potlucks and getting to meet all of you personally.  Instead I’m “Living the Dream” in NE Montana doing what I like to do on my Brothers Ranch.

These are unprecedented times and as I pick up my pen, or computer, to greet you all, my thoughts are mostly what I have learned being in lockdown.  My friends, life is precious and short.  While dancing is the world to many of us, there are other things that are so important to and we can use this time to evaluate and change or tweak what we dare to align closer with our dreams.

We have been given a unique opportunity to stop and reflect, to slow down. To quiet our lives enough to be able to think about things that is important, while staying safe.  What are those things for you?  Your family?  Most likely we need each other more than ever and in some more intimate ways, so don’t forget to be loving.

What about our friends?  We need each other.  We are going through some unprecedented times as we adapt to our new world, we need some social aspects, perhaps in a different way, but it’s a very needed thing to be available for each other.  Depression and suicide are up and people need to be reminded of hope and better times.

Your country also needs you right now to stop and think what it really needs in leadership.  Your country needs your thoughtful vote on who should be in leadership to guide us into a way of life that will bring about peace and tranquility and a world we want to leave to our children.  The decisions we make today will shape our tomorrow, so stay encouraged and keep this in mind.

It may be difficult to focus on our jobs with all that is going on around us, but our employers need us when we are on to give to dedicate our best efforts.  Sometimes it takes a little sweat to smooth out the rough spots.  To accomplish all of this, we need God.  He’s only a whisper away.

I encourage you to reach out to members of your club to check in with one another, to post positive social media on the Federation web site.  Make others smile and don‘t lose hope.  There are brighter days ahead, and we will be dusting off our boots, fluffing those petticoats and fastening our dancing shoes soon.  Keep remembering how special it will be to swing your partner.

If you are excited about dancing again, you could ease into this now by engaging in some round dance lessons.  It takes some time to learn dance gracefully, and since there is not a lot of other activities, you could learn some new rhythms.  Get some exercise in the meantime.

Make each day GREAT and “Swing Your Partner”.
