In case you didn't know, the Rogue Squares are on a limited dance schedule. We are having dances only in January & July, for now. We will give this a trial run and see what happens.  Since our caller, Phil Ramey, has completed a "Caller School" and has some pretty good sounding ideas, the Rogue Squares are going to stick around and see how the situation is after January & the annual "Pajamarama."

In the meantime, we are dancing at the other clubs in our council. The Stars Diamond Lake Festival will be lots of fun. We went to the Buckeroo Roundup in Roseburg and the Gold Digger Dance in Yreka, and had a great time at both dances. We will be going to the Potato Festival in Klamath Falls in the middle of October, and Harvest Hoedown in Yuba City at the end of October. The list goes on & on!

Our July 20th dance was "Potluck Birthday Party for the United States." The caller was Phil Ramey and the cuer was Elaine Funk. The dance was for any dancer who likes a good time and for the recent graduates, both September & January classes.

We are still working on the future for The Rogue Squares. Come on out and help us make a come back. You won't be sorry.

See you in a square!!!!
