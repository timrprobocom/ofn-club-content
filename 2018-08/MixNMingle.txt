In the week before I wrote this the summer weather has shifted from comfortable to way too hot and back to comfortable.  Remember if it shoots back up to too hot again, check the M'n M web page for whether it's hot enough to cancel.
 Please note on your calendar that we will offer cooling, refreshing watermelon on August 18th to wind up the special summer dances.
 By the time you read this our Plus DBD classes will be over for the season.  We welcomed eighty different dancers to the classes.  We hope that they will all come dance with us often.
