We continue to dance Sunday nights from 5:30 to 8:00 at all levels with our competent caller and teacher, Tim Matteson.  We encourage dancers to come dance with us and get more floor time.  Please call our president, David Lajoie at 541-520-7311 or Tim at 541-988-0399 to make sure we are dancing as we go dark once in a blue moon.  We don't want to miss you.  Our dances/classes are always casual.  We always have a lot of food too.  Come for a fun evening almost every Sunday!

So many Spin Cycle Squares members were in attendance at Kirby's memorial service June 9,  Thank you so much.  A bit thank you for all of the help from so many. 

Happy Dancing,
