There was a lot of excitement in the air here at River City Dancers as we welcomed Les and Paula Seeley back for a visit to us from their retirement home in Arizona. Les called our June 14th dance and will be calling for us again on September 8. 

June was also the time of our 67th National Square Dance Convention  which was held in Kansas City this year. Our River City Riders were there representing our area and put on four performances. We are so proud of them.
We recently elected new officers . Ron and Barbara Whitworth are our new president couple.

We continue to dance every second and third Saturday at Millwaukie Community Center 42nd  and Jackson in Milwaukie. Our hall is air conditioned. We enjoy attending visitations to other clubs every month and love having visitors attend our dances. Come dance with us.
