We are enjoying our well attended dances.  We now have 14 new members and they are coming to our dances and dancing very well.  Our new graduates are coming and enjoying our dances and it is refreshing for our other members to see them dancing after their lessons.  It is an investment in time and energy on the angel’s and instructors Mike’s and Julie’s part to help the students in class for those weekly classes and see the new dancers enjoying themselves now is great.
 We are also happy with the turnout to our Plus dances too.  We appreciate all the visitors and it does make it more fun with more dancers on the floor.  
 In August we have a Mainstream dance on the 4th and the theme is Hot August Night with Mike and Ken calling and cueing.  With our air conditioning if it is hot outside it does not slow us down inside.
 Then on August 18th our Mainstream dance theme is ’50s Sock Hop.
 Our Plus dances are the 2nd, 16th, and 30th this month, that is three dances this month.  Darrell Kalmbach and Ken Pratt calling and cueing, intermediate Rounds from 7:00 to 7:30, and Plus dance from 7:30 to 9:30.
