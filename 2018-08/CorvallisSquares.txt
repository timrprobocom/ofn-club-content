Our club is dark for July and August, but we're happy to see there are a variety of dances up and down the valley that we can visit. 

We enjoyed a club potluck in June, and at the meeting we voted to offer a 'yearly dance pass for the 2018/2019 dance season. This will cover all of the Corvallis Squares hosted dances, including the coast trip. Normal price is $6 per dance, or $90 for the entire year. The yearly pass will cost $75.

We look forward to our fall lessons. We've found that most new dancers have been personally invited by a club member, so we're focusing on that and also making business sized cards with lessons information to hand out. We plan once again to dance a demo at the Corvallis Farmersâ€™ Market, on August 4. 

We hope you're enjoying summer in Oregon; some say nothing else can compare! Karen
