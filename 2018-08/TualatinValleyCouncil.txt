The TVC 5th Saturday, June 30th dance had over 8 squares enjoying a Mainstream to Advanced event at the Aloha Grange.  Scott Zinser called an hour of Mainstream with intro to Plus while Jeanine Norden cued Level 2-3 Rounds.  Then they switched gears with an hour of Plus and intro to Advanced with Level 3-5 Rounds.  When the dance was supposed to end at 10, everyone was having such a good time that Scott and Jeanine continued until 10:30.  The Valley Squares won the TVC Banner by having the highest percentage of their club present.
 Our next Council event will be our annual Hahn Farm Potluck and Barn Dance on Sunday, August 12th.  Potluck by the lake begins at 5:30 followed by dancing in the barn from 6:30 to 9:30 PM.
