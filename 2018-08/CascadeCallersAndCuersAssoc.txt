Our new president, Pat Cox from the coast did a fine job heading up the CCCA meeting and dance June 30. 

Our next scheduled dances are September 29 and December 29.  We'll have to decide whether or not we';ll actually have a dance December 29 since New Year's Eve is just a couple of days later.  Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli are doing the New Year's Eve dance December 31 at the hall.  Any callers or cuers present at this dance are invited to call and/or cue.

Kirby Goode's memorial service June 9 was attended by ​a great​
many dancers, teachers, church friends, former school principals, relatives, neighbors, etc.  A big thank you to Roger Putzler for managing the sound and the mic for sharing.  Thank you to so many for helping out with decorating the hall and for taking care of the potluck.  This was truly a fun celebration for Kirby.  He would have loved it! 

Keep on dancing, calling and cueing for FUN
Christina Corelli
Secretary  - CCCA
