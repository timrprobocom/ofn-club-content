As the interim club reporter, I do not have much to report on my own as I was on vacation for both club dances in June.  But according to our club historian Vonda Clayton our first dance held on Friday, June 8 was a success.   It was our annual Reigning Cats and Dogs Dance held as each year as a benefit for Greenhill Humane Society.  Jim Hattrick called the dance and Jackie Gale cued as they normally do on the second Fridays.  Over 4 squares were present and over $200 were raised along with donated pet supplies gathered to help our homeless, furry friends.  We want to thank everyone who donated cash and goods to this good effort.

Our 4th Friday dance was called by K.C. Curtis and cued by Jackie Gale.  While this dance was not as well attended (perhaps because it was held on the same weekend as Summer Festival and our sister clubâ€™s June campout), we know K.C. did his best to entertain everyone with his wonderful voice and good humor.  Next year the Summer Festival will be in July and not on our dance weekend, the Whirl-A-Ways will hold their June campout the previous weekend so we hope this dance will be better attended.  Our club president, Larry (Carol) Reetz, as chair for 2019 Mid-Winter was, of course, in Grants Pass promoting Mid-Winter Festival and square dancing in general.  Don (Yvonne) Schimonitz, our vice president, was in charge in place of Larry. Thank you Don and all who came out to support the caller, cuer and club.  In future we will try to go dark for Summer Festival but as we line up callers so far in advance we never know on which weekend Summer Festival will be held.  We do hope that the tradition of Summer Festival will continue.

We will be holding dances as always through the summer except for Diamond Lake weekend and as always we go casual for July and August and on days when it gets over 80.  We do have air-conditioning and a great dance floor!

Happy dancing this summer wherever you happen to be.
