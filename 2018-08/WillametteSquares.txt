Willamette Squares met at the Salem Square Dance Center in June for their monthly dance entitled  “The Great American Pastime”. Baseball caps and Cracker Jacks adorned the tables, and hot dogs were served. Many dancers represented their favorite baseball teams by wearing the team's colors and logo. Sandy Harris ably called and cued. Everyone present enjoyed the square and round dancing.

At their quarterly meeting club members discussed their upcoming dances for July and August and their Maypole storage. They also discussed their involvement in hosting the state Square Dance meetings and dance taking place on Saturday Sept 4.  Following on Sunday morning Sept 5 will be the State Federation meeting.  
   
On the agenda were Square and round dance lessons scheduled every year in the fall on Sunday evenings. We've learned that Independence Wagon Wheelers will tentatively be offering free lessons at the hospital on Sunday nights which would conflict with our schedule. We were wondering if lessons would be better served by foregoing our lessons and offering to help with the lessons at the hospital. We will be investigating this proposed idea.
   
On a sad note we are grieving the loss of the 14 year old sister of some of our club members. Our heartfelt condolences go out the Rudolph family.  Steve Hoots for Jodee Howard
