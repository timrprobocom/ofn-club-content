August is usually our warmest month and we have our outdoor dance floor ready in time. We inaugurated it with Jim Hattrick on July 7th with a great kickoff dance for our annual summer picnic and dance to celebrate our nation's birthday. We open it to the public and had several new people there who may be potential new students for our mainstream lessons this fall. The floor behind the Barn is shaded by evening and lighted. There are benches around the floor. It was a most pleasant evening with a lot of smiling dancers. Thanks to Marc De La Bruere who put in a lot of hard work and to his many helpers!

Dan Nordbye has been doing Funshops on Monday nights at the Boring Barn to help mainstream dances hone their skills. He teaches us how to break sloppy dancing habits and he works moves from different positions and patterns to sharpen us. Come join us. These workshops will continue throughout the summer, and the dates are on the flyer on the OFN.

Come out this summer and dance under the stars with us on these warm summer evenings. We dance 1st, 4th, and 5th Saturdays.
