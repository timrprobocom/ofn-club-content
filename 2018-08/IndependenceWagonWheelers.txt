By press time, we will have enjoyed our mid-summer July 14 Pie and Tie Dance. We’re sure it will have been a grand evening with lots of delicious pie, good fellowship, wonderful dancing, and with many of the gents sporting “heirloom” neckties. 

Don’t miss our upcoming special dances:  November 3, Halloween Dance; December 8, Christmas Dance; March 9, IWW Birthday Dance; April 13, Easter dance. 
We will celebrate the end of another great summer at our annual IWW Picnic at Maud Williamson State Recreation Site on August 26 and Fall lessons will be in Building D at the Salem Hospital. 

We will be dark in August but you are invited to come and dance with us on the first and second Saturdays at Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall. Mark your calendar – Our kick-off dance of the new dance year is September 1.Hope to see you across a square!  Dee and Bert Mackaman
