Our August 4th dance is "T-shirt Dance", wear your favorite T-shirt.  I should have several, I used to print them.  Scott Zinser is calling.  August 18th dance is "Summer Fun" with Dan Nordbye calling.  Come join us, lets have fun together.
 Valley squares had a very busy month in June.  Tuesday, June 3rd we had our last Jamboree.  Then the rest of the Tuesday's in June we had Mainstream Workshops.  We finished our classes before our dance in June.  June 2nd was our Strawberry Dance with lots of Hood strawberries - they were good!  June 16th was busy, we had a Community dance for a group from 2-5 pm, then our last class from 6-7 pm then our club dance from 7-10 pm.  What a day of dancing, we were tired when we got through.
 And last, but not least, TVC's dance, "Mainstream, Plus and Advanced".  We had a good turnout and lots of fun, we danced until 10:30 pm.  Of course, because we were co-hosting, we had the most members attending and won the TVC banner.  See you in a square!
