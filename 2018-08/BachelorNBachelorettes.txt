It’s getting into the season when we don’t know when we will dance and when we won’t.  Like many dance clubs that rent granges (with little or no air conditioning), the summer temp’s can get too hot to dance.  Basically, if the temperature is over 90 degrees better call our President, Glenn, at 503-829-3062, or consult our Facebook page to see if we’re dancing.
