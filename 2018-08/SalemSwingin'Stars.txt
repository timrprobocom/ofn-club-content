Salem Swingin' Stars dance all summer long. Come join us in the air conditioned Salem Square Dance Center on the first, third, and fifth Fridays of the month. August brings us another 5th Friday Plus dance on the 31st.

We have been busy, busy, busy dancing all over Salem. A group of 20 of us danced at the World Beat Festival on June 30. We had a great time and they want us back next year!  On July 4, a group of us danced at the Lancaster Village Retirement Center. The residents enjoyed the dancing and the group enjoyed the food afterwards. We have also been asked to dance at the Mt. Angel Towers in August for their Western Days.  
We are looking forward to Mainstream Lessons starting on September 12. A flyer will follow soon.

Several of our younger dancers are learning Plus this summer so they can better compete at the Teen Festival next year. See you on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
