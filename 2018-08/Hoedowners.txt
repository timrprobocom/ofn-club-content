June was here and gone so quickly.  We had an abundance of strawberries June 9th for our "Strawberry Dance" and everyone had the opportunity to make theirs special with a selection of favorite cakes and whipped cream.  We danced to "Somebody's in the Strawberry Patch with Sally" along with our "Sally".
 June 23rd found us celebrating "Parenthood".  We brought pictures of our parents to see if we could match members to the pictures.  Some were more difficult than others.  We thank our visitors for joining us for this dance and always.  We love seeing your smiling faces.
 Nothing says summer like an evening baseball game and the Hoedowners are scheduled for an outing on Sunday, August 5th to see a Hops game.  We have done this for several summers now and it is a fun evening.  We will have our private party deck, dinner, sodas, and no host adult beverages.
 Join us for dancing in August.  Our "Here's the Scoop" dance with ice cream sundaes will be August 11th.  Also, "Elvis' will be in the hall.  Mark Wheeler will be our guest caller, and Randy Lewis will be our cuer.
 August 25th will be Hoedowners "Hot August Nights" dance with refreshing cool melons and fruit. 
 Wow, summer goes by far too fast.  Our Mainstream lessons start Wednesday September 12th.  Daryl is a wonderful instructor and even experienced dancers will enjoy the review/brush up.  We especially invite Hoedowners' recent graduates to come be an angel to help our new class, while helping themselves.
