With August comes warm, Really Warm, weather.  As many know, the Hazel Dell Grange does not have air conditioning.  That said, if the temperature is above 90 degrees at 5 PM on a dance or lesson day the club will cancel the event.  The grange received money from the Silver Stars that has gone toward the purchase of new windows and perhaps to window coverings which will greatly assist in keeping things cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.  Kudos to the Stars for their help.  At the same time all of us in the square dance community are sorry to hear they have disbanded the club.
 The Columbia River Dancers will be offering a beginning class, as we do every month, for first time dancers and a class for those wishing to go on to mainstream.  The classes start the first Tuesday of each month.  Since some classes are small our instructor, Jim Hattrick, will call to the level of those in attendance.  This usually means that students advance quickly.  If anyone has the desire to brush up or learn, please come join us.
 August 11th will have Craig Abercrombie Calling for us.  By then the windows will be in and some of the heat may be outside and not in.  Nevertheless, Craig will keep us going hot and heavy.
 On the 25th, Jim will be wearing his Hawaiian shirt and having us dance to music of the Islands as we celebrate our 50th state with our Hawaiian theme evening.  So it will be just fine to have our ladies in their muumuus and the gentlemen in their Hawaiian shirts.
 We look forward to having you come dance with us.  Singles are welcome as the club strives to make sure everyone gets to dance and have fun.
