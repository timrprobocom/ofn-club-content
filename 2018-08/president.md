I hope all of you have either had an opportunity to visit a new club or attend a new special dance this summer or have plans to this month.  In the May OFN, I listed the special summer dance weekends that I was able to find information on.  Following, is a brief description of the special dance weekends that are sponsored by our Oregon clubs through the end of the year.  Most of these dances have registration forms in this issue so if you are planning on attending some, please register early so they know you are coming.

August 31-September 2:  Beachcombers Battle Rock Festival in Port Orford.  KC Curtis will be the caller with cuer Dave Cooper.  Check out the registration form in this month’s OFN for a schedule of their fun events, which includes dancing in the surf and a pie making contest – I believe a challenge was issued during the last state meeting by the last year’s pie making champion!  Please note that if you wish to join them for the BBQ dinner on Friday evening, you must pre-register prior to August 22.

October 12-13: K.C. Squares 43rd Annual Potato Festival in Klamath Falls.  Their festival will have something for everyone.  Their evening program includes mainstream dancing with plus tips and rounds.  During the day, they will have workshops.  On Saturday evening, they will have their annual yummy Baked Potato Dinner.  Please note that you need to preregister in order to join them for the dinner.

October 12-13: R Square D’s annual Octoberfest Weekend in Kelso, WA.  Callers Craig Abercrombie and Adam Christman will be joined by cuer Susan Healea for mainstream dancing with plus tips and rounds in the evening.  In addition to casual dancing during the daytime, their registration form lists many special Saturday activities including a garage sale tour and a German dinner.

October 26-27: Hayshakers and the Sunset Promenaders’ Seaside Sashay in Seaside.  Callers Darin Keith & Scott Zinser will be joined by Cuer Debbie Taylor for a very full weekend including dancing at the Turnaround and the Factory Outlet.  Check out their registration form for their schedule of events.

October 26-28: Rosetown Ramblers’ annual Scares and Squares in the Portland area.  Callers Gary Monday, Kris Jensen, and Michael Kellogg will be calling from Basic to C-2 during this square dancing weekend.  This year, the weekend events will be held in two different locations – please refer to their registration form for information. 

Hope everyone is staying cool this summer!
