June 13th was our Strawberries and ice cream dance.  So many clubs wanted to participate in our strawberry dance!  Wave Steppers, Saddlebrooke Squares, Harbor Haylofters, Cougars, Prairie Steppers, Stardust, Columbia River Dancers, and Independent dancers.  Did you all come for the berries?  I, personally wish strawberry season lasted all summer.  Everyone was having too must have fun for it to have been just the berries.
 June 27th took us "out to the ball game" dance.  There WERE weenies, popcorn and yes, Cracker Jacks.  As well as 52 dancers!  Cougars, Prairie Steppers, Buzz'n Bees, Valley Squares, Ruff and Ruffles and Harbor Haylofters all joined us dancing with 4 squares on the floor. We enjoy a good turnout early for our Plus session from 7-8.  Craig always has ways to stretch us and gives us a good challenge in Mainstream too.  
 We hope to continue with such wonderful variety of clubs dancing with us for August, the last month of our summer dances. (Remember us on 2nd and 4th Wednesdays.)  It is getting close to school time so on our August 22nd dance we will be collecting school supplies for our charity contribution.
 Plan to come for our big Octoberfest weekend October 12-14 at Rose Valley Grange, Kelso.
 Lessons will be a little different this fall: twice a week â€“ on Monday and Wednesday evenings. Plus starts at 6:30 and a combined basic/mainstream class from 7:30 to 9:00. The lessons will start on September 17th and will finish on November 7th.
