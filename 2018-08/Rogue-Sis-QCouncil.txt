Hi Everyone,
The 5th Friday Council Dance on June 29th with Wayne Weaver calling & Elaine Funk cueing was successful. This was the last time Wayne would call a dance before he retires, that is, unless we can catch him on the fly for a dance in the future.

The "Fountain of Youth" dance on July 6th had 3 squares. There were 14 children dancing. Dean Black, from Yreka, did not make it up to Grants Pass for the event due to the Klamathon Fire. They were afraid they would not be able to return home after the dance.

The next 5th Friday Council Dance will be November 30th in Medford with Lawrence Johnstone calling & Rikki Lobato cueing. This should be a great dance with Advanced at 6:30, pre-rounds at 730 and Mainstream w/Plus tips at 8pm.

Please note the change in our meeting place. Starting in August, we will be meeting at Round Table Pizza in Poplar Square.

Please support the Council and the Clubs in the Rogue Valley. Everyone needs all the support they can get. Times are "skinny," so come out and help by supporting your local clubs. We don't want to lose any clubs because of non-support from the dancers.

The next Council meeting will be Aug 7th at 4:30pm at Round Table Pizza, Poplar Square (Medford).

Lois & Lorri
