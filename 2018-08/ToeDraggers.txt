WOW!  Summer is almost over!  Say it isn't so!  What a whirl of activity the toes have had, visitations, birthday celebrations, progressive dinner, club picnic meetings, just to name a few.
 Looking ahead, our dance on August 3rd sounds like a lot of fun... we're going on vacation!  "Vacation Fun With The Toes" so wear your favorite vacation attire and join us, please!
 August 17th is our regular dance, with KC Curtis (Linda) calling and Bev Flint (Harlan) cueing.  The Toes are looking forward to our summer campout at Anderson Park, in Vernonia on August 24th & 25th.  Its always a great time with our Toe family.
 We love visitors & we dance casual in the summer, so see you in a square.
