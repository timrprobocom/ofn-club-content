The Lebanon Strawberry Festival Dances and Weekend were a great success.  The weather was perfect, dances were well attended and our Silent Auction fund raiser was the best ever. 

Our club goes dark for July and August, but members will be attending special dances in the area. We are scheduling demonstration dances in September in preparation for lessons starting on September 16. The Labor Day Weekend at the Cawrse farm is our next big event. There will be potlucks, dancing and lots of fun. Have a great summer!
