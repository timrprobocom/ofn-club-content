We are dark for July and August but have a Camp-out in Vernonia and will be doing a demo at Yamhill Valley Heritage Festival in August. We plan to visit some other clubs, too.

To encourage dancers to take lessons in the fall, we are hosting a free Community Dance on August 18 with free food and lessons. Hopefully we will attract some new dancers for our September lessons. Carmen
