Summer has arrived and we are enjoying the new cooling system that we installed last year! It is great to be dancing and staying cool throughout the summer months. If you are looking for a cool place to dance, come give the Buckeroo Barn a try!

Our mainstream class just graduated and we are enjoying seeing them out on the floor dancing. We will continue with a “funshop” to provide our new graduates with additional floor time until our new set of lessons begin in September. If you know anyone in the Roseburg area, be sure to let them know about the wonderful benefits of square dancing. Check out the flyers as they get posted for more information.

The Buckeroos are lucky to have the Umpqua Area Council sponsor dancing at the Douglas County Fair. Dancing at the fair is always a good time and provides an opportunity to expose the whole community to an activity we all love. If you are in the area, please plan to come and join us at the fair this year. We will be dancing each evening from 7 pm to 9 pm. Check out the flyer as there will be a different caller each evening. Friday evening the 10th of August will be a special evening as we will have Dale Roberson calling for us. He has over 50 years of calling experience and is a lot of fun! Hope to see you there! If you are a square dancer and wear your dance outfit and badge, you will get free admission to the fair…with the understanding that you will dance from 7 pm to 9 pm.

Happy dancing,
Robin Faltersack
