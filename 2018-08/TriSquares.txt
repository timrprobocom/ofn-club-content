In June Tri Squares had a great time on our annual mystery trip.  Sixteen of our members caravanned from Tigard to Fort Vancouver and danced in the gazebo on Officers Row.  Then we took a scenic drive up the Washington side of the Columbia River Gorge to Stevenson.  Taking a very slow trip across the Bridge of the Gods (what an incredible view!) we had dinner at the Bridgeside Restaurant in Cascade Locks.  Afterward we drove to Milwaukie to dance with Darrell Kalmbach and the River City Dancers whose hospitality was amazing! 
 In July and August we will be DARK but we've scheduled air-conditioned visitations to Valley Squares, Bachelor & Bachelorettes, Sunset Promenaders and the Hoedowners.  Also in August we will have our annual picnic at Sherwood's Snyder Park again, up on a hill and under the trees to relax and share time together.
