We are still adjusting to the new schedule but now we need to shift to what we are going to do for the fall season. Our sessions have been well attended and much needed for the phase 2 dancers who need some floor time. Hopefully that will continue.

The dancers seem to enjoy the phase 2 dancing and quick, short workshops on steps that show a need to be improved. We are enjoying plenty of variety and fun. Ken continues his second and fourth Thursdays with phase 3-4 dancing and slow two- step for the summer. I have been out of town so donâ€™t know how they are doing but will find out shortly, now that I am home from Missouri. Hot and Humid! Glad to be back.

Come and see us and join in on the fun of a relaxed evening of dancing and nice people to be around. Marilyn Schmit
