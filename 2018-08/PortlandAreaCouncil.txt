We had three whole squares at our council dance last month.  Then (next evening) we were longingly contemplating the TVC council dance across the river.  The PAC had a couple levels of squares and mostly phase two rounds.  The TVC had three levels of square dances and progressively high levels of rounds all night.  And the result?  The TVC had three times as many attendees!  Weâ€™ll need to consider that.
