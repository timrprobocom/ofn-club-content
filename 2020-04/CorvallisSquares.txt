February held good times for our club. Our birthday dance was a fun evening and we’re grateful for all who came to share in the festivities! Our mainstream square dance graduation was at the end of February—quite a celebration! Many thanks to our class coordinators and angels who shared their enthusiasm for the fun activity and camaraderie that square dancing brings. New members add to the energy of the club! 

By the time this OFN comes out, we will have had our annual Coast Retreat the weekend of March 13-15. Highlights include the dancing, of course, and the social time including the group potluck on Saturday at noon. It's not too early to save the 2nd weekend in March for next year's Coast Retreat!
