 Well, we are back in swing with 2 dances this month: April 4th & 18th.  This is a special month, too, as it was in April that Randy and Jeanine did their first dance with us!  Of course back then they were hired as a guest caller and guest cuer but it was very soon after that they became our permanent caller and cuer and a great team.  That was 20 & 21 years ago; they just get better and better.  Here's a heads up,  M&M’s are dancing May 2nd but,. . . . . M&M’s  WILL  BE  DARK  ON  MAY  16.  We will keep you updated on calendar changes thru this OFN report as well as our website:  mixandminglesquares.org
