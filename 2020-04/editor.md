The coronavirus pandemic has hit the square dancing world particularly hard.  Unfortunately, our world is like the worst case: it is a very physical activity, necessarily involving a lot of personal contact, and our population is demographically way older than average, thereby making us more vulnerable.

It can be difficult to see the justification for all of these cancellations.  After all, you are in charge of your own health, and ought to be able to make your own choices.  However, with a virus like this, the stakes are substantially higher.  It's true that, statistically, you will be just fine if you contract the virus.  The problem is that you are contagious before you see symptoms, and in some case the virus runs its course without causing any symptoms at all, while you remain dangerously contagious.  During that time, you are spreading the virus to others, and a percentage of those people will die.  That's the result we're trying to avoid.

The CDC has now asked that all gatherings of 50 or more be canceled, and any gathering with more than 10 "vulnerable" people (meaning those over 60 and those with existing health conditions) be canceled.  Unfortunately, that means virtually every square dance event.

Hang on tight, and we'll all get through this.
