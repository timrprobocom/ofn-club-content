As of this writing, we have not canceled any of our dances due to the threat of the novel coronavirus. We have bathrooms right off the dance floor to make hand washing easier and always have hand sanitizer out and ready to use. We will pay close attention to wiping down commonly touched surfaces like door knobs and drinking fountains. Remember to be considerate and stay home if you have any fever or respiratory symptoms. We understand the dances may be smaller, but many of us need the exercise and social contact. Our dances are never over 250 persons, which is the size cut off set by our governor. If we do need to cancel an event, it will be on our Facebook page, our website, and on the OFN. You can also call Marc De La Bruere at (503) 502-8478 for the latest.
At this time, we are looking forward to our Murder Mystery Play and Dance on April 19th, performed by the Crazy 8 Players. Patricia Neils has a broken ankle and may be playing her character in a wheelchair. Pray for her speedy healing! It is another original play, so come and be part of the fun. Tickets are on sale now! If you have not gotten yours, contact Bev, Marc, Young, Patricia, or Carol.
