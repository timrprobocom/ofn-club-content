The Buzzin' Bees are continuing with our mainstream lesson.  We are still excited about our students and all the support from our Angels.  
April 18th is the Buzzin' Bee anniversary Dance.  The Theme is Honey Time!   This will be our 62nd anniversary and we will have  KC Curtis calling and Lonnie Sycks cueing.  We start dancing with pre plus at 7pm and Mainstream with rounds at 7:30 pm.   Come and join us!
