The TVC fifth Saturday Dance on Leap Day, February 29th, "Celebrate Winter Ending" at the Aloha Grange was well attended with over 100 dancers.  Adam Christman and Joyce Hooper made the evening special.  The dance was co-hosted by the M 'n M's who did a very good job!  The club with the highest percentage of their members present, the Oak Hills Squares, took home the TVC banner.  Well done!
