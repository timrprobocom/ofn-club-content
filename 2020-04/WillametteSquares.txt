The Willamette Squares had a great time at their regular monthly dance. Everyone seemed to be in a jovial mood as we twirled and boxed and promenaded! There were a variety of refreshments and a number of announcements plus split the pot! As we prepared to say good night in our large circle, Sandy, our caller, ran around the inside of the circle giving everyone a hearty high five! It was a fun night! Jodee
