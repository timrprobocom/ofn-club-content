In February we held only one dance but it was a good one!  It was our Sweetheart of a 56th Birthday Dance with quite a few visitors to swell our ranks.  Jim Hattrick was his fantastic self and we welcomed him back along with his current protégée Melissa James and former protégée Mark Wheeler.  We had six squares in the hall and lots of birthday cake to celebrate.  A good time was had by all.  Thank you all who came and made this so much fun.
 
We did not hold a dance at the end of February as the hall had been rented out to the Eugene Opera for rehearsals.  Jim will be back calling our 2nd Friday dances and we look forward to having Darrell Kalmbach call our 4th Friday dance in April.  I got to dance to his fine calling at the Independence Wagon Wheelers 60th birthday dance March 8.  He is such a fine cller—he along with George Hermann and Bruce Lowther made it a special dance for sure.
 
Keep on dancing, everyone, and stay well.
