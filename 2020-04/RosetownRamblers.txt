The Ramblers already planned to be dark in March to support the Puddletown Squares dance weekend in Seattle on March 14. Then, the darkness of the coronavirus descended, and the Seattle weekend was canceled—as were most square dance events for the month of March, including our club’s lessons. Our fervent hope is that things will be back to normal by the time this news is published.
 
If we’re able to resume dancing, we have a real lulu teed up for April 11. This will be the Rosetown Ramblers Spring Formal* (*formal attire optional), a mash-up of Easter bonnets and prom and cotillion and however else you interpret “spring” and “formal.” Creative attire admired! The caller will be international phenom Gary Monday, from Seattle. We will alternate Mainstream and Plus dancing from 7 to 9:30. The second tip will be an Advanced star tip.
 
Our graduation dance is scheduled for May 9—stay tuned for more info, as that date could change depending on when we resume lessons.
 
Wishing good health to all and much dancing delight!
 
Jeff Knapp, President
