This has been an interesting year for us so far and it looks like that it will continue to be so for a while.

Leonard Snodgrass is resigning as our club caller as he has decided to accept a position as club cuer for Valley River Dancers. We wish him luck. His last dance as our caller will be our May dance. Since this is also usually one of our dinner dances, please come out and join us in sending Leonard off with a smile and as full a dance floor as we can manage. Please watch for our flyer for our May dance for more information.

We are taking advantage of the dances we have left with Leonard to have prospective club callers come in to share the stage and "audition".

The Knights and Dragons are practicing hard and we are still fundraising since our competition is May 1st and 2nd. Mom (Karyn) has had to do a lot of rearranging with practice schedules for us this year so that we can have as much time as possible together as teams. Petrina Buchheit
