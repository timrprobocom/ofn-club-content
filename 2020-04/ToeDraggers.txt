The Toe Draggers are having fun with new dance themes this year.  In January we all danced with masks on during our Masquerade Ball.  In February, we danced among the Cherry Blossoms and served foods featuring cherries during our break.  In March, we were planning on another new dance theme featuring the March Hare and Alice in Wonderlands, but due to concerns for our dancers and our guests, the Toe Draggers will be rescheduling our Alice in Wonderland theme for April 17 (hopefully).  Theme clothing or costumes are encouraged as you join us for our tea party after a great dance.  During our break, we will have different kinds of tea for you to enjoy along with all of the yummy finger foods that you might find at tea parties. After our Alice in Wonderland Dance, we will have a Raining Cats and Dogs Donation Dance for the furbabies in local shelters.  More fun themes will be coming your way so stay tuned for more details.
 
The Toe Draggers decided to cancel our March 20th and our April 3rd dances due to the COVID-19 Virus concerns.  We hope and pray that all of our square dance friends and family will stay healthy and safe.  We are looking forward to dancing with you again when all of our clubs resume dancing.
