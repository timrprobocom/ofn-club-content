We continue to dance two Sundays a month as long as we can muster a square or two.  On February 9th we were treated to the calling of Dan Preedy who was passing through our area.  He is such a fine caller and we enjoyed dancing to him a lot.  He even called a C-1 star tip for those of us who know C-1.  We hope he’ll come by our way again soon.  But in April we will have Dan Nordbye back in the state and  hope he’ll call for us once a month like he did last year.
 
On Saturday Feb. 29 a whole square of Cast A Shadows members danced to Randy Dibble in Woodburn.  Everyone had a great time and look forward to doing it again on the next 5th Saturday. 
 
When we don’t have a live caller, we dance to recorded tips by nationals callers.  We dance at eh Emerald Square Dance Center at 2095 Yolanda Ave. in Springfield from 2-4PM in Hall B behind the center.  If you are in the area, please come join us.  We’d love to have you in one of our squares.  To see a tentative schedule of our dances go to CAS-sd.yolasite.com.  Be sure to call ahead of time if you are not on the email list so you know for sure we are dancing.  Call Fred Beisse at 458-221-3564 or Gaynor Hintz at (541) 741-4149.
