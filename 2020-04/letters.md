title: Pacific Northwest Teen Festival Canceled
---
To All Oregon Councils and Clubs from Silver City Squares Youth:

This is to let you know that the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival for May 1st & 2nd, 2020 has been cancelled. This is the first time in their 70 years of history that this has occurred and was decided by the PNTSDF Committee during their meeting on March 15th. The cancellation was made with the condition of a 1-year age extension also happening – any youth who was eligible to compete in any category this year will be able to do so next year in the same category.

This was not an easy decision for the Committee. There were several reasons involved in this decision, including: The clubs/participants from Canada are by order of their National Government under a mandatory 14 day quarantine upon return if they leave Canada as well as current school closures and a ban upon gatherings similar to Washington and Oregon – these are all from their National Government and not the Province/local and are in place until lifted by their Prime Minister; many of our participating clubs have been unable to practice for at least 2 weeks at this time and are looking at not being allowed to hold any practices until close to the end of April – due to most of them using schools to practice in; uncertainty of actually having a location May 1st & 2nd to hold the Festival – Auburn Mt. View High School had indicated that IF school was back in session, they would still rent to the Festival but if schools were still closed we would be out of luck; judges were backing out; no indication if Washington would have the gathering ban fully lifted by that time.

There was discussion about the possibility of just postponing this year’s festival to June or summer or fall – this was not going to work for most of the participating clubs, so it was discarded as an option.

The Silver City Squares youth are going to continue with practices at a slower pace for this year as well as continuing to fundraise. In view of this, their Fundraiser Dance, cash raffle drawing, brunch has been postponed to Sunday, May 3rd and a new flyer is posted. All funds raised this year will be rolled over to help with next year’s expenses. Please disregard the letter that the kids sent out to the clubs and councils for this year – this was sent out prior to the Teen Festival committee making their decision.

Thank you for your understanding and support of our youth.
