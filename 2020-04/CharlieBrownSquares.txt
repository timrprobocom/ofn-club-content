We hope everyone is staying healthy during all of this chaos!!  March started out well with a fun dance on March 7th w/Phil Ramey & Sarge Glidewell. We had a great visitation from the Star Promenaders and they stole another of our banners - so when things settle down - we will need reciprocate!!! Our classes & workshops are going well; unfortunately as with most, if not all other clubs in Oregon; we've had to shut down thru at least April 8th. We remain optimistic that we can pick things back up after that. We have the April 18th Rainbows & Roses dance still scheduled at this time with Chuck & Elaine. 6pm A1 w/Chuck & PreRounds @ 7pm followed by Alternating Plus & Mainstream.  We hope that our dancing will return to normal soon!!  Of course we have the Boatnik Festival; and that is still on schedule and will be a fabulous & fun weekend w/Bronc Wise & Peter(Chama) Gomez - what a way to celebrate!!
