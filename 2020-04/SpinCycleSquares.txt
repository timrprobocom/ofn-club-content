We were dark a couple of Sundays end of February and the beginning of March when the Eugene Opera was using the hall for their rehearsals. 
 
We dance every Sunday with very few exceptions from  5:30 with Tim Matteson calling all levels mainstream to advanced.  Tim is very good at adapting levels for whoever shows up.
 
Remember, our hall has a cushioned wood floor, air conditioning and even heat!  We always seem to have a lot of food too! 
Come one, come all and join us for FUN dancing and camaraderie. 
Call Tim Matteson at 541-988-0399 or David at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are dancing.  We'd hate to miss you!
 
Come and dance with us!
