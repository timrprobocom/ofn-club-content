Welcome to April.

As we move through situations around us and across the country, please take a moment and check on people you haven’t seen or heard from in a while especially those who you know live alone or don’t have relatives in the area. It doesn’t matter where you know them from: long time friend, church, square dancing or other activity, another family member – just check on them and make sure they are ok. If you yourself live alone, please make sure that you have made arrangements to check in with someone regularly too.

There are several reasons for checking in with people – it is comforting to know that there is someone who will call for help if they don’t hear from you (or the other way around); you or someone else will know that you or they are not forgotten; and it will give someone actual human contact if they are currently self-isolating. We all need this reassurance even if we won’t admit it.

A check in can be by phone call, email or text. Just reach out. Your contact may be the only one they get that day.

Let us continue to use good sense – if you aren’t feeling well, please stay home if you can and take care of yourself. But on the other hand – don’t panic and do a year’s worth of stocking up on supplies. 

Have someone from your club keep the “Where and When” updated so others know if you are dancing for a particular night. If you are looking at going out – check the “Where and When” first and then, if you still aren’t sure – call the contact number to double check.

Keep safe and hopefully see you out and about again soon.
