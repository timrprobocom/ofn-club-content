 Thank you for all you lovers of dance joining us for our February Valentine dance which fell on Valentine's Day this year.  February 22nd, we had 2 visitations: Columbia River Dancers and a bus load from Independence, Oregon Wagon Wheelers so we had a total of 71 dancers, 5 and 6 squares on the floor all night long.  Guest caller Mark Wheeler brought in nostalgic music for our 50/60 theme dance.  You should have seen all the poodle skirts.
 April 1st through May 20th Craig will be offering a new set of Plus workshop/lessons on Wednesdays at 6:30 pm-7:30pm.  April 10th is "Spring Celebration" theme dance.
April 25 we will be dark for the Yakima Sashay.
 It is not  too soon to remind you of our OCTOBERFEST weekend, October 9th and 10th.  Please note the location will be Catlin Grange in Kelso!  You can start checking GPS now, it is a closer location for most.  RV parking is available, but dry camping.
 Come loosen up those gardening muscles and join us at a dance.  See you, Annie
