 In February our classes in Mainstream and Two Step continued along well.  We had a great turnout for our annual anchor dance, the “Mardi Gras Masquerade Ball” (which happened to fall on Valentine’s Day this year) and gave away beads and special prizes for best costumes and masks.  We went dark for our second February dance just so that we could visit the Valley River Dancers in Newberg, to welcome them into the TVC because both our clubs will be dancing on the same Friday nights now.  Fourteen of our members showed up for that visitation, which is half our club! 
  In April we plan to visit the double-anniversary dance for the Valley Squares on the 18th and Eager Beavers on the 19th.  On the 26th we have our annual general meeting and election of officers, once again at Dundee’s La Sierra Mexican Restaurant which has a terrific side room and great food.  Please join us at the Tigard Grange on the 10th for the “Spring Up and Pay It Forward” dance when we collect donated goods for the Tigard Good Neighbor Center, and on the 24th we dance to “Grace Notes” which is all Gospel and Singing Calls.  Both dances are with our caller Terry Halley and cuer Sandra Pinion.
