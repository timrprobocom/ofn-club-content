The month of February was a slow month for our club. We continue to work on Fox Trot and review other previously taught rhythms. The later class is working on dances taught at recent dance weekends. The cuers continue to work on adding more dances to their available listing so we as dancers have more variety.

Once the Federation ballots are received, we will hold a meeting to vote on them and to work on club officers and thoughts for what we want to do in the future. Our club is small but steady. Come and join us soon. Marilyn Schmit
