 Our February 15th "Valentines & Soup" dance was great.  We had lots of soup for everyone and a great time visiting before we danced. 
 Our classes are coming along very well, everyone is having a great time learning and getting to know each other.  Tuesday, April 14th will be our Jamboree, 7-9 pm.
 Our April 18th dance is our "71st Anniversary" dance.  Come join us for a great dance.  Scott Zinser is calling , Connie Clark cueing.  7- 8:30 pm Mainstream, 8:30 to 9:30-ish pm Plus (we dance until we no longer can).
 See you in a square,
