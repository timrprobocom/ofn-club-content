Greeting s from Yreka
   Once again I begin with sad news. Long time member Linda Hayes passed away due to the many complications of Muscular Dystrophy. She and Ron dedicated countless hours helping our club, volunteering as officers and board members, along with heading and running our "Pepsi Booth" over the past several years. She will certainly be missed.
   Thank thank you to everyone who attended our Valentine's dance we had three squares. we danced Advanced, Basic, M/S and Plus A big thank you to our Oregon dancers, as well as many of our Monday night dancers. They really had a great time showing off their new clothes that Peggy got off of the Stars clothes racks. A very special thanks to Elaine for doing our rounds, we look forward to having her do our future dances.
We hope you will join us for our St. Patrick's Dance with a splash of Mardi Gras thrown in. We are planning our Easter Bonnet Dance in April. We had great fun last year modeling Bonnets and Hats. So be sure to dig out your best Bonnet or Hat and plan to attend. There will be a special prize for the best Bonnet and hat.
    We are working on something special for our 52nd Gold Diggers Dance. We plan on raffling off another custom locket. Even with the conflict of the Nationals we hope to hold the dance but are shooting for the 4th weekend. Who knows this year it may be a two day event  :-0  :-)

  We hope to see you on the floor
  Dean
