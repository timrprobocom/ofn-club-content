Again, I can't remind you all enough. Don't forget July at Diamond Lake in 2020. We will have a real "TRIFECTA" and a Bonus with 3 callers of National status. We will have Mike Sikorsky, Michael Kellogg and Mike Haworth, with the bonus of Rikki Lobato as the featured cuer.

Our March "Game Night" was a lot of fun. Attendance was a little thin, but we all had a great time anyway. The next Game Night is May 8th and the potluck theme is "Hillybilly Fixins'."
That is something like beans and cornbread, or some such, I think.

The "Teddy Bear" Dance originally schedule for March 28th, is going to be postponed. There is not a new date available yet, but we will advise everyone when it will be. This is such an important event for the kids in Jackson County. The Stars are once again collecting stuffed animals for the Jackson County Sheriff's Department to give to children in distress. Las year we collected and donated 200+ animals. I think we can do better. There is a tote on the stage at the Rogue Valley Square Dance Center to put the animals in. PLEASE HELP!

We are once again going to sponsor the Alzheimer's Benefit Dance. It will be Sunday, June 7, 2020 from 2pm to 5pm.  This is a very worthy cause and hits home to a lot of us in the square dance world. All proceeds will go to Alzheimer Research. The Callers & Cuers are donating their time and the Stars are donating the hall.  A challenge has been issued. Last year we raised $520+ and the challenge is to double that, at the very least.

See you in a Square!
