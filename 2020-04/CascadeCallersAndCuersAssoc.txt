We had a nice Fifth Saturday dance February 29, leap year. It was one of our dancers "17th" birthday so he got in free and had a cake and ice cream to celebrate too.  Rosco Isbell is 68. That was fun! 
On a sad note, Gail Jackson, one of our newer callers, lost her partner and best friend, Richard Kinkle.  Richard suffered a heart attack unexpectedly.  Gail is also our treasurer.  Gail always felt so blessed to have Richard in her life, and we all are so sad for her.  We will have a fifth Saturday Amateur Dance August 29.  We encourage anybody who wishes to call and/or cue for fun to let one of us know. 
 
Our next Fifth Saturday Dance is also the Area's Benefit Dance for Food for Lane County which will be  May 30, 2020.
7The format will be the same as usual with 7:30- Pre-Rounds and 8:00 Squares and Rounds.
 
Calling and Cueing for fun,
Christina Corelli, Secretary CCCA
