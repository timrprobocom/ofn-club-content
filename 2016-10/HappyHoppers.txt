The Happy Hoppers are celebrating Harvest time this month.

We work hard to make our education program a comfortable environment for students.  Many of our club members volunteer as "Angels" to help make it an easy and productive experience.  Every Monday, Plus lessons will be given at 6:30, Basic lessons start at 7:30, and Mainstream lessons are available at 9:00.  We are committed to serving both beginners and continuing students with our lesson format.  Square dance lessons for new beginners will start on Monday, November 7th at the Clark County Square Dance Center.

As always, we have Plus dances on the first and third Saturdays of the month at the Clark County Square Dance Center, with our club caller/cuer, Jim Hattrick.  This month, it is the 1st and the 15th.  Pre-rounds start at 7:30, with squares at 8:00.  Our Harvest Days dance will be on the 15th, with pumpkin themed treats at the break.  

There will be a Tri-Council dance on the fifth Saturday, October 29th, at CCSDC with Craig Abercrombie and Adam Christman officiating.

The future of our venue, the Clark County Square Dance Center is still very much up in the air.  A sale is pending, but before that can be culminated, there is some litigation taking place about property boundaries.
