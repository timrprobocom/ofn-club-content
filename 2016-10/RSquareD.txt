Where has the summer gone?  R Square D had a busy summer.  In August we had two "Demo" dances.  One was at Canterbury Park where one of our members, Jean Turner, lives.  The next day we danced for the Castle Rock Senior Center's annual picnic.  Food was served at both of these demos and you know how square dancers love to eat.  Some of our members also visited River City Dancers and enjoyed the calling of Les Seeley & Rene Rudd and cueing of Tami Helms.
 At our Back to School Dance on August 24 we collected over $100 worth of school supplies to be donated to a local school.  Also that evening our Caller, Craig Abercrombie work shopped the dance "Running Bear".  We had fun with it and hope that we will be able to play with it again at a later date.  We had visitors from Las Vegas, and Cougar Squares.
 Lessons are starting in September.  Craig will be teaching "fun" starting on the 19th.  Let's see how many lessons people we can share the fun with.
