By the time you read this, we should be back to more moderate weather.  This summer we had to cancel once in June, once in July, and once in August due to the excessive heat on those days.  It helps having a webmaster who keeps our website up to date so dancers can check online for such happenings. 
 November 5th we will celebrate our 32nd birthday with lots of great dancing, as well as birthday cake and ice cream.  Come join us.  Four charter members are still members.  Lindie Noonan has offered to put together three containers of M&Ms for the usual chance to guess how many little candies are in each one.  The best guessers take home their prizes.
 We are happy to welcome new members Rick and Robin Faltersack.
