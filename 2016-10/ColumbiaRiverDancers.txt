Members of the Columbia River Dancers met in a park-and-ride lot on September 10th to take a bus ride to the Washington State Fair where we met with what some said were 400,000 fair-goers that day. Almost 600 of us planned a surprise square dance. At exactly 2 PM in three different locations on the fair grounds (one place could not accommodate us all) dancers began what is going to be classified as the largest mob square dance in the world. We danced for about fifteen minutes and then tried to melt into the crowds. After signing in to show that we were indeed there and danced we had time to see the exhibits and have a burger loaded with Walla Walla sweet onions. If interested in seeing what the mob squad looked like, you can go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrtGoR7tXN8 and catch the action. 

We rejoined our bus at 6 PM and traveled to Olympia where we visited the Do-Si-Dos and danced to callers Craig Abercrombie and Jim Hattrick. We finally arrived home about 12:30 AM tired but happy to be with so many of our great friends. Thanks go to Danny and Carol for making the busride so enjoyable, supplying us with BINGO games and snacks.

We were dark on the 24th of this month as the hall was used for an annual Clogger event. Being dark does not mean the CRDs do not dance. Instead, we made a visitation to the R Square D's.

The month of October is also unusual as we will be dark on the 22nd as most of our members will be attending the Seaside Sashay. WE WILL BE DANCING ON THE 8TH, HOWEVER. Darrell Kalmbach will be calling, and Dorothy Lowder will be cueing.

Another reminder that after you eat all of your turkey and zone out with Thanksgiving Day football Saturday, November 26th we will host national caller Dan Nordbye with Julie Stiers cuing... our first annual "Turkey Burn-off Dance!"
