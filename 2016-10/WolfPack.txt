It’s that time of year again and our Tuesday night classes for new dancers with Sandy Harris are underway since September 13th. Next set of Basic 51 square dance lessons starts in mid-November.

 We had our “Back to School Dance” on September 3rd.  Due to Labor Day weekend and the Ducks season opener, the turnout was light as expected, but those who came really enjoyed the dance.

 Our next dance will be October 1st.  Thinking ahead, November 5th will be our “Harvest Dance”.  Hope you can come and join in on the fun.
