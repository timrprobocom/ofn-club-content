With Summer now over and Fall in full swing, we are settling into our dance year. Our new dance hours seem to be working out well and the dancers are really enjoying the change.
We had a great time at our second annual Sock Hop.  The costumes were terrific. Our next special dance will be our Veterans Day Dance on November 12.  All veterans will be admitted to the dance free of charge as a token of appreciation for their service.
Our new dancerâ€™s class is off to an amazing start and the students are very enthusiastic. Happy Dancing.
