<p>Hello everyone. Here&rsquo;s hoping the first dances of the new season have been successful with everyone anxious to dance and clear out the cobwebs if they have not been dancing a lot during the summer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I write this, it is raining and a good day to stay home and get caught up on paperwork, which is what I have been doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was installed two weeks ago, I mentioned I was the sender when I spoke to the officers and delegates and they were the receivers. Then all of them would be the senders when they went back to their areas and shared all the information they learned at the state meeting.&nbsp; As you read this, you are the receiver. You will be the receiver when a dancer approaches you for information or asks a question of you for you to follow up on with the area council or state Federation. Do so with a smile on your face and get back to them as quickly as possible with an answer or a direction for them to follow to get more information on their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still have a few state directories for sale. First come, first served.</p>
<p>They were done camera ready this year and the result was OK but still needs a little tweaking to make it perfect. Corrections will be listed elsewhere for what I have received so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be doing some traveling during my presidency and if you would like me to attend a particular event, give me enough lead time to make plans around my regular schedule of home club and part time care for my mother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See you at Mid-Winter, if not before. Come say hi and let me know who you are and where you are from if I don&rsquo;t already know you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
