The Tri Squares had a very fun summer visiting other clubs.  We also had our Annual Summer Picnic.  At the picnic we had one of our members play music, another told jokes and we played lawn games.  Our lessons started in September.  If you’ve already tried square dancing and want to give it another try we’d love to have you.  Our lessons are on Sundays at 3:30PM until 5:30PM.  The Tri Squares is also holding Waltz lessons from 2:00PM to 3:00PM.
 We now dance on the Second Saturday and Fourth Friday of every month.  Our Caller is Terry Halley and our Cuer is Sandra Pinion.  We look forward to seeing you at one of our dances.
