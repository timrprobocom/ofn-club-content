Our last dance of the summer was a “Lick the Heat” dance. I think it worked as it was cooler and we got some rain. So we celebrated with ice cream and all sorts of goodies so we could “split it, float it, and a la mode it” in style. Pictures were sent to the OFN to show happy faces, and some pretty good imagination for what was put in the bowls to fill them up.
August has been spent on floor time in various rhythms to get better for the fall season. Next we start Foxtrot in the lesson time of 7:30-8:20 and continue on with Tango in the 8:30-9:30 time slot to finish off where we left off in July. 
We have reserved the dance center for New Year’s Eve and will start making plans shortly so we can get some advertising out and get some attendance working.
