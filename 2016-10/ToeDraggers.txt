The Toe Draggers cancer fund raising dance, ”Are You Man Enough to Wear Pink”, is coming up on Sunday, October 9th.  Proceeds will be donated to Breast Cancer Research at OHSU Knight Cancer Institute.  As in years past, in addition to the dance, there will also be baskets of treasures raffled off.
 The Toe Draggers are looking for a new club reporter.   Pat Olson has done a stellar job over the past few years and is now club secretary, requiring her to step down from the reporting duties.
