Wow! Summer really hit in August!  Once again, our camp-out was without campfires due to high fire danger. Luckily, this year we were still able to have one. Thousand Trails at Pacific City includes a lodge with a swimming pool and an upstairs area we could dance in so we took the chance to invite campground guests to dance with us Saturday night. We had several folks among the observers who tried Square Dancing and they all said they enjoyed it very much. The Campground would love to have dancers come do this regularly! Leonard is really great at encouraging and teaching people and keeping it fun. Sandra cued between tips to showcase Round Dancing as well. We danced and laughed a lot!
Six club members also visited the Sunset Promenaders and had a wonderful time there. We are looking forward to dancing and hope to see you in a square!  Our new dance year on the third Saturday as well as new lessons began in September. We bought a huge banner that is hanging on the main street of McMinnville and we hope it brings us lots of new dancers.
