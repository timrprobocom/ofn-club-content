The Wave Steppers’ last dance of the 2016 season will be a Fall Dance Saturday, October 8th, with club caller Joe Wrabek and the Club’s line dance instructor Gwen Kiel.  Dancing starts at 7 p.m.
 The Wave Steppers’ dances are held at Garibaldi City Hall, 107 Sixth Street (just a block off US 101, 9 miles north of Tillamook).  About two-thirds of the second floor of City Hall is a dance floor, built in the 1940s for the old Firemen’s Balls.
 A new round of square dance classes started September 21, taught by club caller Joe Wrabek; these are on Wednesdays, 6 to 8 p.m. at the Tillamook Elks Lodge, 1907 Third St. in downtown Tillamook.  Classes are free.
