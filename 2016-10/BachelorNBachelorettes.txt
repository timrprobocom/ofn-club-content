Aug 16 marked our community event at Burgerville.  We brought in $211, half of which weâ€™ll donate to the PAC.  We also got $12 in the tip jar.  There was no caller to call a tip, so weâ€™re not sure where that money went.

We had a great visitation to the Valley River Dancers Aug 26.  Even the illusive B&B limo showed up!  Club chauffeur, Mo Mopar, was at our service.

We had a good representation at the Oregon State Fair dance demoâ€™s.  Free dancing, free fair â€&ldquo; what else could a person want?

And weâ€™ll have a good representation at the Seaside Sashay.  Former mud wrestling champ Mary Theirl has gotten out her bikini, ready to make a comeback.  You donâ€™t mess with Mary!  You gotta come see her, covered with mud, and maybe nothing else.  5:AM Saturday morning, at the turn-around  (so Iâ€™m told).

Plans are being finalized for our new bathrooms at the grange.  The guys already have a great sauna and hot tub (so Iâ€™m told), but the new ones will be even better (so Iâ€™m told).  Just listen to Ace Reporter Lotta for all the latest B&B news!
