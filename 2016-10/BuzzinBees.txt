Happy fall you all! It has been cool a rainy this past week so I am having to face the reality that fall is coming. As I write this, we haven't had our first dance yet but lessons start Sunday and the next weekend is our first community dance party. We are trying something new this year. Our first 4 dances will be community dance parties that are open to everyone.  Casual attire. We will be teaching some basic moves so everyone will be able to be on the floor to dance. Those dances will be on 9/17, 10/1, 10/15, and 11/5. We'll keep you posted.  Better yet, come join us. 

We are adding plus lessons at 5pm on Sundays followed by mainstream at 6pm.

We dance to the fabulous KC Curtis, caller  and Debbie Combs, Cuer extraordinaire at the Hazel Dell Grange on the first and third Saturday with pre-rounds at 7:30 and main stream at 8pm. See you in a square!
