During the summer, our club seems to have had lots of fun -- gathering, eating, playing games, and some dancing.  
Charlotte and Bill Jeskey entertained lots of dancers at a variety burger barbecue /potluck on Sunday, August 21 at their home. Great food and great fun!  
Labor Day weekend at the Cawrse farm was also a wonderful time. Potluck on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights meant lots of super food. There were 10 campers staying with Frank and Marianne for the weekend. Then on Sunday afternoon, Charlotte called from the heights of the silo -- Silo Dance. What a glorious weekend! Besides the Lebanon Square Circlers, other clubs represented were Silver City Squares, Sweet Home Squarenaders, and Willamette Squares.   
Our first dance of the fall was on September 17, 2016 at the IOOF Hall in Lebanon  
See you in a square!
