It has been a busy month of dancing for us here with a regular dance, our Annual Corn & Cluck and a 5th Friday Plus Dance. Next issue will have news of the Chickenâ€™s appearance at the Corn & Cluck!
We also have a Mystery Trip planned for Saturday October 15.  We will depart from the K Mart parking lot on Mission Street in Salem at 4:45 pm.  Cost is $15.00 per dancer.  Please call Nancy Donaldson at 503-581-0029 or Sheila Machado at 503-884-0158 to sign up or for more information.  We are going to have a BLAST!! 
Mainstream lessons have started again and Randy is also offering Advanced lessons on Wednesday nights at 8:00 pm.  He is teaching A1 and A2.  If you have already had Advanced but would like to brush up or add to your skills, come join the group! See you all on the Dance Floor.
