Now that summer is over, we are planning several seasonal dances including the Halloween dance on the 28th.  Look for our flyers at your dances.  The clothing resale is October7th and should be a success.  It is always nice to unload some clothing and get something new to wear.

We had many wonderful summer dances with air conditioning.  So nice and cool even though it was so hot outside.

We have excellent parking in front of the hall as well in the back.  We welcome couples and singles.
