Grab your saddle shoes and join us for our annual 50s dance on Friday, September 23. Randy promises to dig out his 45s and spin some rock and roll to keep us jitterbugging in our squares. A half hour of plus starts at 7:30 with mainstream and rounds at 8:00. 

Welcome home, Jan and Terry, from the cruise adventure of a lifetime around the British Isles and France. Speaking of cruising, spotted frequently off the Oregon coast cruisin' for salmon are Stan and Teija. Many club members will cruise up to Bend for a September 30 benefit dance at Pine Forest Grange where Randy is calling Friday night and holding a workshop on Saturday morning. Once again, Lori and Don are opening up their home and ranch for dry camping. 

We expect a great turnout from our club at the Seaside Sashay in late October. Between dancing and catching up with square dance friends, it's always a weekend full of great fun.
