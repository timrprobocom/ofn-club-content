The Club had an enjoyable picnic at Noble Woods Park with lots of good fellowship and great potluck food.
 Several of the club went down to the Wave Steppers on the 13th of August for a good time.
 In August the Sunset Promenaders went to the TVC Hahn Barn Dance and won the TVC attendance banner for the highest percent of the club.
 Several club members went to the State Fair and did a demonstration of round dance with Ken Pratt our club cuer doing the cueing.
