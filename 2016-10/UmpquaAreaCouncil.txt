Veteran’s Day Parade
Mark your calendars to come join us on November 11 th in the Veteran’s Day Parade. Doris generously volunteered the use of Neil’s truck again this year. You can sit in the back of the pick up, walk the route, or take turns dancing along the parade route. Dust off your red/white/blue square dance finery and comfy walking shoes and come out to show your support for our local veterans. See our flyer for more info.
