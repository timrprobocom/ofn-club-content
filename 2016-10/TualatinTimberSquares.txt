Tualatin Timber Squares has had a wonderful summer with visitations from clubs and new dancers.  Everyone agrees the ice cream parties each dance was a big hit!  We graduated 3 new dancers who are loving it and became new members of our club before their lessons were over!
 First time coming to our club?  Let us know at the door we have a special dangle for you!  
 Now is the time to start shopping for your Ugly Christmas Sweater or skirt.  Don’t wait! They go fast at the thrift stores.  You’ll want to have one because we’ll have prizes at our big party in December.  Details to follow.
 September 14th we had up and coming caller Courtney Sewell from New Mexico sharing the stage with our club caller Janienne Alexander.  What a privilege to host her during her vacation!
 Come join us in October when the weather is cooler, the club's chili and cornbread hits the spot and we'll kick up our heels and dance the night away!
