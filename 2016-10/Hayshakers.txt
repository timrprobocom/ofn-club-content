We are dancing twice a month, the 1st and 3rd Friday at 6:30.  We have not been able to get enough people together to have lessons for several years, but we have had one or two people want to start lessons every once in a while so we have been doing half lessons, half dancing.  It is not the best solution, but hopefully we will be able to get a few more members.  Please call before you come to visit to make sure we have enough people for dancing.  We do thank the Wave Steppers for helping us.  Remember the Seaside Sashay in October, the 21st and 22nd.  It is a lot of fun.
