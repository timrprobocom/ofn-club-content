<b> Last minute update: the dance mentioned below honoring our award winners has been rescheduled due to a conflict, from October 9 to April 8 </b>

Hello from the Milton-Freewater Muddy Frogs!  The M-F Community Building, 109 NE 5th, home of the Muddy Frogs, will be the site of a dance on Sunday, October 9 honoring Bill and Neva Reid for the Parker Award and Merri Anne Huber for the MacGregor Award.  We are a small club, so we are especially proud that half the awards at the last Washington State Festival went to Muddy Frogs!  The dance, which will be sponsored by the Blue Mountain Council, will begin at 2:00 p.m. and will be called by Jim Swanson.  We would love to see your smiling faces!  As we are on the border with Washington, our club belongs to the Blue Mountain Council of Washington, as well as the Blue Mountains Council of Oregon.  How's that for confusion!   For further information, please call Merri Anne at 541-861-9055.

Keep on dancin'!
