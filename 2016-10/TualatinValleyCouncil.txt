We had over 8 squares attend our Hahn Barn Dance with a wonderful respite from the hot weather.  Thank you to Gary and Bette Hahn for their hospitality and the use of their barn and to caller Terry Halley and cuer Julie Stiers for a fun dance.  Thank you also to everyone who attended and for the delicious potluck by the lake.  The Sunset Promenaders won the TVC Banner for having the highest percentage of their club in attendance.
 The next TVC event will be the Tri-Council Dance on October 29th.  This fifth Saturday dance will be held at the Hazel Dell Grange in Vancouver Washington and will be hosted by the Evergreen Council.  The Front Porch Trio, Jim Hattrick, Adam Christman, and Craig Ambercrombie, will be calling and cueing this dance.  It begins at 7:30 with one half hour of pre-rounds and continues until 10:30 Mainstream with every 3rd tip Plus.
