As I write this, we're looking ahead to our fall lessons starting on September 26, and we're hoping for a good-sized class. Our dance season started on Sept. 10 and we're grateful for the refinished wood floor at our dance hall. Later, in October, we're having our yearly Halloween dance on October 22 and it will be a fun and festive time! Happy Autumn everyone!
