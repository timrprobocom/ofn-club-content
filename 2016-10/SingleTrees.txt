 Greetings for the fall season:
On the last dance of August we experienced excellent dancing with Jim Voll's smooth calling for our Western Hoedown dance. He was in peak performance and we all enjoyed it. Thank you Jim. And on first dance in September with Jim Hattrick, we had scads of visitors. It was wonderful to have a big crowd to welcome Jim as our 2nd Friday caller. And a big thanks for the other callers who did their turn for a tip. Thanks to everyone who came, participated, brought food, worked in the kitchen, and enjoyed the free dance. It was a real winning formula.

Hope to see some visitors for our Halloween dance on October 28th. We will have prizes for the best costumes in several categories. Come and have a "bootiful" time.
