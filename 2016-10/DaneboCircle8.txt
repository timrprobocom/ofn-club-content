Danebo Circle 8 lost one of its long time members when Pat Preston passed away on September 4th. Pat was Past President of Circle 8, was active with Mid-Winter Festival and with the Emerald Area Council. She will be sorely missed. Our condolences to her husband John and her sister Linda Curtis.

Our September 17th dance with the State Board in attendance will have happened by the time this issue is released.

We are looking forward to our dance on October 15th with Bruce Lowther calling and Judy Russell cueing. All of our dances are at the Emerald Square Dance Center, 2095 Yolanda Avenue in Springfield. Pre-rounds are at 7:30 and mainstream squares run from 8:00 to 10:00
