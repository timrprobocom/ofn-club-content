Annual Retreat
The Oaky Doaks will be having their annual retreat October 7th â€&ldquo; 9th at the Sun Lodge Retreat Facility in Wemme, Oregon (near Welches on Mt Hood).  It will be a great time to get together with everyone who attends. There will be time for visiting, table games (bring your favorites), as well as opportunities for outdoor games and hiking (weather permitting). As usual, there will be some planned entertainment for Saturday afternoon and evening. 

As far as accommodations are concerned, there are three dormitory style rooms with bunk beds (one female and one male). There are restrooms, complete with showers, in each area and are furnished to accommodate each gender. A room for co-ed sleeping is also available. There are also two rooms to accommodate those with physical needs that need special attention (electricity for machines, etc.)  

The cost will be $40.00 per person / under 18 is $15.00 for the weekend.  Saturday only will be $10.00. Money should be paid by Oct. 1st (or make arrangements with Bonnie Ivy).   The names of anyone that will be attending the retreat is needed ASAP so we can plan activities for that many. This year the Oaky Doaks are opening the retreat up to anyone that wants to attend.
