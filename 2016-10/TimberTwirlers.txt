Timber Twirlers are back dancing after a long fun summer. Lessons started Sept 20 and we hope to have a good class this year. Thank you to the State Federation for passing along the great division of money they received. We are making plans to use a lot of it for class promotion next year as we gather ideas on what best to do.
Oct 7 will be our annual Talk Like A Pirate dance. It is always a well attended dance and great pirate gear worn by a lot of our visitors make it even more fun.  
We have lots of creative themes for our dances this year so come join us the first and third Fridays of the month at the IOOF Hall, 738 SE 5th in Albany.
