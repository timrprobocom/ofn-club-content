The Charlieâ€™s are back in the swing of things!! New classes started on Sept 6th for Beginners. We have 2 more free classes on Sept 13 & 20th.  We have a DBD Mainstream class following the beginners class to help improve our dancing skills. We started a new Plus class Sept 8th followed by A1 class. We were dark for Saturday dances in September at our hall; but many of us are headed to Yreka for the Circle N Squares 62nd birthday dance on September 17th. Will be a fun celebration.  We had our club picnic on September 11th with about 30 members in attendance and 2 squares dancing. Thanks to Phil for helping to secure a location for the picnic.

We will be back dancing on the 1st & 3rd Saturdays. Oct 1st is our Stone Soup Dance & Oct 15th is our Cake Walk The Plank Dance.  Ray Holmes will be calling and guest cuers will be Steve Murphy & Bob Dingman.  Check out the flyers!

Hope to see everyone at a dance soon!!
