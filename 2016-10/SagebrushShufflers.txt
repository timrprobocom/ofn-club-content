Summer has been quite busy for the Shufflers. We started off by cleaning one mile of the highway coming into Prineville as part of the Adopt A Highway program. In July we visited the Red Rocks in Redmond and danced on the council float in the Crooked River Round-Up Parade. As we were dark in August we had a picnic in the park with Jim Steele calling a few tips. We had a good turn out of club dancers with two squares at the picnic. We ended the summer with a few of us going to the 3rd Friday Night Stroll demo dance in Redmond. We are moving our club dances from Powell Butte back to Prineville in September. Our new dance hall has a cork floor covered in Pergo; the sound is great. We are happy to be back in our own stomping grounds. Shufflers beginner square dance lessons begin October 6. If you are ever visiting Prineville come check us out.
