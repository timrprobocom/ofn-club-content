Fall has arrived and things are settling down here at the Buckaroo Barn. Lessons began a few weeks back and we have 25 new students. Most of our students are brand new dancers, but we do have few recent graduates acting as angels. Our youngest new student is 10 years old….our oldest is 78 years old!
Our dances went great this past month with lots of dancers out on the floor. We also had a few visitations this past month.  All of the practice is helping our newest members become awesome dancers! 
The Buckeroos are looking forward to joining the Umpqua Area Council and marching in the Roseburg Veteran’s Day Parade. 

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
