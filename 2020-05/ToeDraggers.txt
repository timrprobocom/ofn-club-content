 Toe Draggers are showing the remarkable ingenuity, resilience, and courage, indicative of square dancers everywhere.  They are enjoying many activities: volunteering, baking, sewing, home improvements, gardening, yard work, exercising, on line schooling, games, puzzles, and getting things done now that they didnâ€™t have time to do before.
 Chin up everyone, this too shall pass. Until we all meet again in a square, stay well.
