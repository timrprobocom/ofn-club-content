Where to begin? We cancelled our April dance. We are hoping to be able to hold both the kids' rescheduled fundraiser dance on May 3 and our regular dance on May 8. Please watch the Where & When to make sure that we haven't had to cancel or reschedule these.

The kids have had to pause on practicing and will hopefully keep working together some over the summer. Fundraising will continue for next year with everything that we raised this year rolling over to next year.

May 8 is our last dance with Leonard as our caller. If we are able to hold the dance, please come out to help us wish him well as he moves on as a cuer. Hope to see you soon!!!  Petrina Buchheit
