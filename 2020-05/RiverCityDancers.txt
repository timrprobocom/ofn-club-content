We miss you all and miss square dancing but health and safety is a main priority during this coronavirus outbreak. None of us know when this will end and we will be together again on the dance floor with our fellow square dancers. Please stay home and stay safe.

While our hall has not been in use, we have used this opportunity for maintenance, and improvements to the hall.  The old ceiling tiles in our basement have been replaced with a new ceiling and new lighting. New paint was also added. . We hope that when it is safe to gather and dance again that you will visit us and enjoy these lovely improvements to our hall.

We will post our dance dates on our website as soon as we know, meanwhile we wish you all good health. Stay home and stay safe.
