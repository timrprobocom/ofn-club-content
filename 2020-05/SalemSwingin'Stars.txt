We hope that all of our Square and Round Dance friends are doing well during this unexpected and uncertain time. The Salem Square Dance Center will remain closed for the month of May so that means all of our dances in May are cancelled. We hope to resume in June, (with the rest of the world). Take care of each other. Yellow Rocks to all. Sheila Machado
