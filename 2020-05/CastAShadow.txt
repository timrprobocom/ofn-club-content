We have had no dances in March due to the coronavirus pandemic and the governor’s banning social gatherings of more than 10 and the social distancing rules going into effect...  We all can’t wait to get back to dancing as soon as this crisis is resolved.
 
Stay safe wherever you are sheltering in place.
