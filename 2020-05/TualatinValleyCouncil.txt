A message from the TVC President, Mike St.Clair: "Just a note to reach out to our family of dancers.  I know everybody is missing our dances but we have to do what we can to keep everyone safe and healthy.  Please let us know if anyone needs help we will do what we can to help.  In my life I have not seen any thing like this but if we stick together we will come thru this and get back to what we do best dancing and having comradery with all of you.  Stay safe and in touch"
 Three of our TVC clubs had to cancel their Anniversary dances in the past two months; the R Square D 67th anniversary on the 28th of March, the Valley Squares 71st Anniversary on the 18th of April, and the Eager Beavers 45th anniversary on April 19th.  All TVC clubs have suspended their dances and lessons due to the Covid19 pandemic.  The Sunset Promenaders have set up a weekly conversation via email with members and any other dancers who want to join in.  It is moderated by Ed & Ginny Mickelson.  They can be contacted via the Promenaders webmaster for www.sunsetpromenaders.com.  Other clubs may want to do something similar.  It helps to keep everyone in touch. 
 Perhaps some light on the horizon... The Indianapolis 500 has been rescheduled for August 23rd, the same weekend that the Oregon Summer Festival is to be held in Seaside.  Two TVC clubs are co-sponsoring the Summer Festival, which at this point, has NOT been cancelled.  Hopefully, groups will once again be allowed by late August.
