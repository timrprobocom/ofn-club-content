 After our March 2nd board meeting, everything was cancelled due to the COVID-19 virus pandemic which is covering the world.  We hope to continue board meetings, at least, over the internet.  Our elections are due in the meantime but the pandemic looks like it will last several months at this point.  We hope all of you stay home and stay well, and that we might all be together again in the fall.
