We did not hold a dance in the month of March.  Our Friday evening dance March 14 was to have an Irish theme and we were all eager to get a taste of the baked potato bar to be held before the dance at 7PM.  Alas, all the preparations went for naught when we got the word to cancel on Mar. 13.  We hope we did not catch anyone unaware as we tried to get the word out to our members and fellow dancers.
 
We have small hope of having a dance in May.  That dance would have been the Mexican Fiesta dance we put on with the help of the Whirl-A-Ways.  These combined dances have been held annually for about 5 years now and are always a great success, rivaling only our birthday dance in February.  Perhaps by June we will be able to have dances once again but one cannot predict at this point when this virus will wear itself out.
 
Single Trees has made some very huge changes that will take effect starting in September.  We will stop holding dances twice monthly and drop to only the 4th Friday.  Because so many holidays fall on the 4th Friday weekends along with Mid-Winter Festival we will only have 9 dances in the coming dance year.  We hope to retain Jim Hattrick along with other guest callers to offer some good dancing on the 4th Friday of every month except December, January and May.  Our door fees were raised to $6 this past dance year.  Our dues will go up to $20 starting in September.  We are hoping to stay viable for several years to come.  Weâ€™ll see.
