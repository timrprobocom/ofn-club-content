Cherry City Cloggers have suspended their dances indefinitely until the restriction on social gathering has been lifted and it safe to do so. We give tremendous cudos to Glee Johnson and Grace Allen as they are continuing to do videos of dances that we can access via YouTube or our website cherrycitycloggers.com to keep us all dancing and our skills sharp.

There was a group of our dancers who were considering going to the National Clogging Convention in New Orleans, Louisiana in July. However, we haven't heard anything as to whether that will be postponed. 

We're hoping things will be back up and running somewhat normally in the near future so that we can continue to have our lessons for beginners starting in September. Georganne Pfnister
