We did have a Fifth Saturday Dance February 29 just before the coronavirus business hit us all hard. 
    
We are supposed to have our annual Emerald Area benefit dance May 30, but time will tell if that happens.  Our beneficiary this year is Food for Lane County.
 
Our hall in Springfield was closed around March 9 and will remain closed until further notice.
 
We trust everyone is doing what they can to be safe and that everyone is well and healthy.
   
Wishing you all good health,
Christina Corelli, Secretary
