DANCING IN HEAVEN Doris L. Murray
November 17, 1932 - April 4, 2020

Doris Murray was born November 17, 1932, in Climax, Saskatchewan, Canada, and passed away peacefully at the age of 87 in her home in Coos Bay, Oregon, on April 4, 2020. Doris and her husband, Marvin, were married in 1954 in Bagley, Minnesota. Their honeymoon was a one-way drive to Coos Bay, Oregon ...... the honeymoon never ended as they remained residents the rest of their lives!

Doris and Marvin began square dancing in 1978 and were Charter Members of the Saints-N-Aints Square Dance Club, under the caller Ron Bliven. In 1984 they earned their “Rover Badges” dancing in Bagley, MN, and in 1987 earned their “Double Rover Badges” dancing in Hawaii. They attended the 30th National Square Dance Convention in Seattle in 1981 and the 43rd National Square Dance Convention in Portland in 1994. They held several offices within the club and were “angels” in all beginner classes.

Doris is survived by her son Michael (Cecilia) of Houston, TX; her daughter Barbara (Dennis) Ivey, of Eugene, OR; and her sister Esther (Maynard) Gulbranson of East Grand Forks, Minnesota. She was predeceased by her loving husband of 58 years, Marvin, in 2013, and her sister Ruth Nyhus in 2006. 
May Doris and Marvin frolic in the joy of square dancing in heaven and be your “angels” from above!
