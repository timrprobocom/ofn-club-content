 I don't know what to say for May.  We write this the first of April so we have the entire month to go before we can make a decision about dances or classes in May.  Everyone is in this same situation, unfortunately.  So all I can say is stay home, stay safe and we will all get back to dancing when we can.  When we make a decision about our May dance it will be reflected in the OFN Where & When.  
 Take care, miss everyone, hope to see you soon,
