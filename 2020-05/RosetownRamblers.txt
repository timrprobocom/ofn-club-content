The Ramblers have been in suspense since March 11. We were having so much fun teaching our latest group of Mainstream students to dance when the novel coronavirus decided to rain on our parade. We’ve experienced some heavy weather in our club’s history, but this is unprecedented. We miss the dancing and camaraderie, but keeping everyone healthy is our top priority. We will follow guidance from the state and federal health authorities as to when, and how, it’s safe to resume dancing. When we’re able to start dancing again, we will post updated information on our website, Facebook, and Meetup.
 
We’ve been keeping in touch with our members through a phone tree and by email messages. A couple of our members have had symptoms consistent with COVID-19 but were unable to get tested, so we can’t say for sure whether they had it. Hopefully, if they had it, they are immune now.
 
Our members report that they are reverting to simple pleasures such as planning and preparing home-cooked meals, knitting, writing poetry, reading, gardening, cuddling their dogs and cats, sewing, and catching up with friends and family by phone or trying out newer video technologies such as Zoom.
 
We wish good health, fortitude, and perseverance to all our square dance friends and colleagues all around the world.
 
SYIAS!
