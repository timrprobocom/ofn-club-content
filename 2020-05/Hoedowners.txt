 Where ever did March go?  Out the window!  In response to the Covid19 pandemic, Hoedowners cancelled all planned May activities.  We’re on hiatus until we’re given the go ahead for large group activities.  
 This is temporary.  Let’s look ahead, stay safe and keep the welfare of the entire square dance community foremost in our minds and keep our distance.
