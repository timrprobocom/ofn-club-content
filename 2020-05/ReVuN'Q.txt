Happy Spring, everyone (I think!) Wish we were dancing and enjoying good weather. Time to shed the winter clothing and be comfortable, but we are not able to do that yet. We have been dark since March 12 and wonâ€™t start dancing again until the first part of May. The dance center is closed down for a deep cleaning and furnace replacement at the end of April. 
We are looking forward to getting back to dancing and continuing on our way through the Fox Trot steps. We will change to our summer schedule in June through August. Just have to wait and see how this virus stuff hangs on. If things go well, we will have a 44th birthday party in June. Stay tuned for more details as time goes by. Marilyn Schmit
