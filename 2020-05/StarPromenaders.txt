Again, don’t forget July at Diamond Lake in 2020. We will have a real “TRIFECTA” and a bonus of 3 callers of National Status. We will have Mike Sikorsky, Michael Kellogg & Mike Haworth, with the bonus of Rikki Lobato as the featured cuer. There will also be the “Crazy Hat Contest” organized by Becky Petetit and the Friday afternoon Taco Bar organized by Lorri McIntosh.

The Stars held their annual election of officers on April 9th. They will officially take office in May. President: Phil Claudson 1st VP: Pierre Petetit 2nd VP: Thom Gilsdorf Secretary: Frank Krause Treasurer: Frances Ramey & Asst Treasurer/Rental: John Olson

The “Teddy Bear” dance originally scheduled for March 28th, is going to be postponed.

We are once again going to sponsor the Alzheimer’s Benefit Dance. It will be on Sunday, June 7, 2020 from 2 to 5pm. This is a very worthy cause and hits home to a lot of us in the square dance world.  All proceeds will go to Alzheimer Research. The Callers & Cuers are donating their time and the Stars are donating the hall. A challenge has been issued. Last year we raised $520+ and the challenge is to double that, at the very least.

See you in a square
