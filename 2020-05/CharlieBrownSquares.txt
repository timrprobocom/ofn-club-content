We hope everyone is staying healthy. We certainly miss our dancing and our dancers!!! Classes and dances have been on hold since Mid March - and at this point we don't know when we will be able to return to our favorite activity.  We were scheduled to be dark already for the 1st dance in May. We have had to make the very difficult decision to cancel Boatnik, as well as our special MidWeek dance with Don & Marie Wood on May 13th.  We were hoping to have Boatnik, but with all the uncertainty; we had no choice but to cancel. We appreciate Bronc Wise & Peter Gomez's understanding; and we look forward to having them at a future event! If you already purchased your ribbon; please consider rolling it over to 2021 Festival with Jet Roberts & Rey(Sherry) Garza.  If you would like a refund, please let  us know.  Whatever you choose; please let Jeanne know so that we can keep track for next year. Her email is: slickjeans54@yahoo.com 
Our May 16th dance is in limbo at this time; we will let everyone know as soon as we can if we will be able to have the dance. No flyer - just keep May 16th as a possibility - Chuck & Elaine are the scheduled Caller & Cuer and it's our Hug A Hero Dance!  Again - we miss everyone and look forward to getting together and dancing again!!
