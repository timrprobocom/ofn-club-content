M&M’s will not be dancing in May.  In line with other clubs, we are going to be dark until further notice while the “stay home” order is in place.  We hope it won’t be long until we are all up and running again.  On a lighter note, we did hold our elections - all electronically this year.  Our “old” Board has shuffled to these new positions: Dan will take over for Lindie as President and Lindie will take Dan’s place as Treasurer  (they’ve been swapping for years!).  Our VP is Rick, our Secretary is Pat and Robin is Member at Large.  All are looking forward to getting back into the swing of things.  Until then,  please stay well and take care of each other.
 We will keep you updated on calendar changes thru this OFN report as well as our website:  mixandminglesquares.org
