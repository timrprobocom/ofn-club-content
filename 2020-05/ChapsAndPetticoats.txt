Hello Everyone, are you observing “stay home, stay safe” as a precaution to the CoronaVirus pandemic?  Thank goodness for the OFN, huh?  At least we’ll keep in touch.

We are monitoring the closure or our dances on a dance-by-dance basis and cancellation of a dance is dependent on whether the COVID-19 “lockdown” is still in effect or lifted.  At the time of this publication, Chaps and Petticoats has cancelled three dances thus far:  March 20th, April 3rd and April 17th (our Go Hog Wild dance), thus our May 1st dance may also be cancelled - check our website or Facebook page for future status.

On a humorous note:  I saw a post of a business mascot whose face was covered by a medical mask. This does, indeed, make us feel like we are in an alternate universe, thus a good time to stay in touch with your members and friends - you are at home, just pick up the phone.

These are our upcoming dances through June, IF the COVID-19 “lockdown” is lifted - we will be ready to dance with you:

* May 1st  (no-theme)...our Caller/Cuer is: Scott Zinser & Sandra Pinion
* May 15th, “Flags of Valor” dance with:  Roger Putzler and Dave Cooper - wear the    Red, White and Blue, 		
* June 5th (let’s just dance)...our Caller/Cuer is: Scott Zinser & Connie Clark,
* June 19th (to be determined … we were previously DARK to support Nationals).    INFO:  Since Nationals closed, we hope to dance … see June’s OFN.

DO check the OFN and the Chaps and Petticoats Web or Facebook media for future closure announcements.  

Stay healthy, 

Betty Chipps
