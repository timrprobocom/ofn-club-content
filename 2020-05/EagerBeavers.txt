 John Lennon said, “Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans.”  LIfe is happening all too suddenly and dramatically for most of us right now and nobody knows when we will feel normal again.  We had all kinds of plans for April and May but now everything is stopped cold with no idea when we can dance again.  
 Our last dance was March 9th so there is not much to report. We had planned to vote on and install new officers in April and May but I am not sure how we will accomplish that task.  Sadly, we also had to cancel our Anniversary Dance in April. 
 We started our plus classes in February and I have been amazed at how quickly our students have progressed. There are times when you cannot tell the students from the members and I think I might be one of those.  Lessons will be rescheduled when we can safely start dancing again.
 Remember Mother’s Day, May 13th.  If you happen to be a mother look in the mirror and say,  “I did the best I could with the information I had at the time.”  Rules of parenting have changed quite a bit in the last fifty years and I am speaking of personal experience.  I also ignored a lot of my mother’s advice, didn’t you?
 Keep yourself well and healthy so you can join us when life becomes nearer to normal.  We dance on most holidays. Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Remember, our new dance hall is the Aloha Grange.  Please check for up to date information at www.EagerBeavers.info.
