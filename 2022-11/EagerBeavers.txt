Eager Beavers are grateful to Craig Abercrombie, Darrell Kalmbach and Jeanine Norden for filling for Jim Hattrick’s while he was recovering from surgery.  We have been cheering Jim on during his recuperation from the broken hip, and look forward to having him back on the stage soon.

Our club was finally able to have our annual picnic in the cooler weather of mid-September with plenty of fun and games, including the ever-competitive board baseball.

On September 17th, a number of Eager Beavers attended founding member Paul Swenson’s 101st birthday party in the backyard of his home, and enjoyed sampling the three different cakes in the shapes of 1 0 1 that were made by his talented granddaughter!

We dance Plus with Rounds every Monday afternoon from 1:00 to 3:00, including most days. Come dance with us in November and enjoy Jim Hattrick calling and cueing on the 7th and 21st, and Darrell Kalmbach calling with Jeanine Norden cueing the 14th and 28th.   Most of  our dancers are vaccinated, we currently do not require proof of vaccination.  For current information, please see our website at http://EagerBeavers.info. (see link above)
