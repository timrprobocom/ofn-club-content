Our Round of the Month (November) is “Stripes”, a two-step.

The council is planning to have visitations to clubs on their anniversary.  We’re also trying to arrange joint visitations with the Tualatin Valley Council.  We’d do this in hopes we can double the number of visitors to our mutual clubs.  Accordingly, our next joint visitation will be to the M&M’s November 19th.

It was also mentioned that specialty dances need to be highly publicized, so they are not in competition with regular dances in the area.  (Hopefully, other clubs might cancel their own dances to support the specialty dances, as they take a lot of work to organize.)
