We are back to calling, cueing and teaching squares and rounds.  It's been a LONG two years, and we've all managed to get through it!  Whew! 
  
Our next Fifth Saturday Dance is October 29, 2022.  We'll have pre-rounds at 7:00 and then a mainstream dance with rounds at 8:00.  Can you believe 2023 is just around the corner?! Unbelievable! 

The Fifth Saturdays in 2023 include April 29, July 29, September 30, and December 30. 

We are continuing to stay safe with our members being vaccinated, etc.  We continue having hand sanitizers available as well.  Individually wrapped snacks are welcome.  Our water fountain has been turned back on, but we realize some will opt to bring their own water. 
 
Welcome back to calling, cueing, teaching and dancing! Continue being safe, everyone!
 
Keep on calling and cueing!
