It is with pleasure that the CRD's let everyone know that Jim Hattrick is back calling and cueing.  He is walking a little slower but has not lost anything but weight.  We need to keep him in milk shakes. 

We had our first set of lessons starting in October.  Round dance lessons in 2-step have returned and had a small but enthusiastic group for our beginning square dance class.  

November will have our annual Thanksgiving fling so come dance with us.

On a personal note, I was disappointed last month when we had only two squares of our core dancers dancing to a national caller.  It was discouraging that dancers seem to stick only to their club dances and not venture out.  We have basically lost two clubs this past year and that troubles many of us.  I wish I had an answer.

Well, as an optimist  I want to think that people will get back into dancing and next year will be the best ever.
