Tri Squares’ first dance of the year had to be cancelled!  That weekend was hot and smoky, and fire danger was so high in our area that PGE was planning to cut power in some places.  At the very same time our caller suddenly came down with Covid and we couldn’t find a last-minute substitute.  So, with all that confusion the dance just wasn’t meant to be.  But our second dance was great!  It was our anniversary dance and lots of visitors came, including ten from the Sunset Promenaders!  In addition in September we began lessons with approximately 15 Mainstream students and 10 Waltzers.  And we visited the Chaps & Petticoats at their Trails-In Dance.  

In November our lessons will continue (but please check our website (link above), because we couldn’t get the Kinton Grange for one of them, and there’s a possibility we may find another venue.)  Lessons are on Sundays, Nov. 6, 13, and 27 at Kinton Grange, at 2:00 for Waltz and 3:30-5:30 for Mainstream.  And for all dances and lessons this month our caller is Terry Halley and our cuer is Sandra Pinion.  Our two dances are on Fridays:  Nov.11, "Grateful Harvest Pie Party" (yum!)  and Nov. 25th, "Black Friday" (black & white dance).  7:00 Plus & PreRounds, 7:30-9:30 Mainstream & Rounds with one Plus tip.  Donation: $7.  Break is at 9:30.  (Masks are optional for now; please check our website for any masking updates.)
