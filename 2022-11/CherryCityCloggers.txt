We are now three weeks into our Intro to Clogging Class. We are excited about how many have joined this class. It is still not too late to join if there are others who would like to learn to clog. We hope those who have joined us will continue through to graduation, which will occur just before Christmas, and that they will desire to join the club come January. Glee is doing a wonderful job getting them all started and excited about learning to clog. We continue to have our 4:00 class, the Intro class at 5:45 and the Intermediate/Advanced class at 6:30. 

It is great to see the dance floor beginning to fill back up after being so restricted due to the social contact requirements of the pandemic.
