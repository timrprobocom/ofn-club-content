We had a good turnout for lessons that began in September, averaging 9-14 students per week. They are enthusiastic and coming right along. A big thanks to all the Angels who show up to assist each week.

Our Corn ‘n Cluck dance on September 16 was a great dance with six squares. We had chicken and corn on the cob plus lots of other tasty dishes. Mike Kious was our Guest Caller and Leonard Snodgrass our Guest Cuer for the evening. The wind-up chicken races were a blast and we had two winners. So much fun!!!

Our 5th Friday Plus dance was a good one. There were not many Advanced Dancers, so we went with Plus for the entire evening.

The first Friday in October was another fun dance. Four of our six Youth dancers were in attendance. So much energy!

We will be DARK for the third Friday, October 21, because Randy Dibble is calling for the Seaside Sashay and several of the club members will also be attending. November 4 is our next first Friday dance. See you on the dance floor.
