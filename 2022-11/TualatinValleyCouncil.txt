Since the OFN is published about the 20th of the month, you still have time to plan on attending the October Harvest Dance on the 29th, perhaps the last Tri Council Dance.  It will feature Jim Hattrick and be held at the Aloha Grange, 7:30 to 8pm rounds then 8 to 10 Mainstream with every 3rd tip Plus.

Tim Keck, President Oregon Federation, was one of 19 participants of the TVC monthly Zoom meeting on September 26th.  Officiated by TVC President Ursula Kuhn, topics included upcoming dances, reimbursements to clubs for class lessons, reporting of State meetings and Festivals, and after the Evergreen Council decided not to host the Tri-Council Dance, what to do next year.  Also, the Hahn Barn dance will be in September next year in an attempt to have cooler weather.

November has two member clubs celebrating an anniversary.  On the November 3rd the Sunset Promenaders Plus celebrates their 8th Anniversary at the Hillsboro IOOF hall.  Then on the 19th, the Mix 'N Mingle celebrates their 38th anniversary with a dance on at the Winona Grange in Tualatin.  Although a Plus club this will be a  “Floor Level” dance so all Mainstream & Plus dancers are welcome.  The Council highly recommends that all TVC dancers attend the anniversary dances held by other member clubs.

Our next dance will be New Year’s Eve at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro featuring Darrell Kalmbach & KC Curtis calling with Tami Helms cueing.   Pre-rounds begin 7pm, Mainstream from 7:30 to 9:30 with celebration at 9pm.  Every 3rd tip Plus.
