We will have a special Halloween Dance with the fabulous caller from Albuquerque, Kris Jensen from 4:00 to 6:00 October 30 at the hall in Springfield.  Costumes are optional but also a lot of fun!  There will be individually wrapped snacks only--no potluck.  We encourage dancers to be responsible for their own safety which may mean wearing a face mask and socially distancing off the dance floor.  There is a $5 donation for everyone for this dance.
 
We dance every Sunday from 4 - 6 at the dance center in Springfield at 20th and Yolanda.  Tim Matteson is a great caller and will call whatever level we can muster.   We have individually wrapped snacks on hand.   We invite you all to join us!  We're a fun bunch-- that's for sure. All dances are casual.
 
Please call our president, David Lajoie, at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are, indeed, dancing.  Once in a blue moon we are dark.
