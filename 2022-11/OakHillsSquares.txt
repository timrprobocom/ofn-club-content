The Oak Hills Squares continues to meet every Monday from 6.30 -8.30pm at the gym in Oak Hills. NW 153rd Ave, Beaverton

Our new beginner classes started on October 3rd , 6.30 – 7.25pm. We were thrilled to have 10 new dancers come along. We will be taking new students through October 17th and have already heard that more folks will be coming along. It is a very exciting time for our club.

Our caller is the amazing Mark Wheeler, who makes every Monday a fun time.

Our goal over the next couple of months is start going as a club to some dances. We plan to go at least one a month so we can meet up with everyone and introduce our newly graduated dancers.

November will see us doing a demonstration dance and beginner class at the LDS church in Lake Oswego. We haven’t been for a few years, so it will be good to go back and spread the fun of square dancing.

We hope as we move into the Fall that the positive trend continues and we can see our club grow.
