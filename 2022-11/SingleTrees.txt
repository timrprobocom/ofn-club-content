On Sept. 23 Single Trees held our first dance of this season with Scott Zinser calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  What a fun night!  We had two very strong squares on the floor until the last tip just before 10.  Scott had to review a few moves as we had some “rusty” dancers on the floor.  We were so pleased to see one couple from Lebanon Square Circlers and three couples from our sister club the Whirl-A-Ways.  Perhaps we’ll see more visitors now that the season has begun.

Our caller Jim Hattrick as many of you know had a bad fall and broke his hip this summer.  He is now recuperated and tells me he is back to calling and teaching.  We look forward to seeing him in October for our Halloween Dance October 28.  Costumes are optional and we will at times award prizes to most original, etc.  Jim is our club caller and always makes the dances fun along with our fabulous cuer Jackie Gale.  We will have a 4th Friday dance in November, the day after Thanksgiving so come dance those calories off!  We will be dark in December and January for Christmas and Mid-Winter.

Please remember that masking is optional and that hand sanitizer continues to be made available.  Snacks are provided for the open breaks for those who need a little sustenance.

Please come join us for a fun night of square and round dancing from 7:30 to 10:00 at the Emerald Square Dance Center in Springfield.
