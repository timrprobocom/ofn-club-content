I’m sometimes amazed at how few people direct our club.  We have club officers (elected) and committee members (volunteers and appointees).  Several of our helpers are both officers and committee members.  We all step in and help where needed, and that’s how we quickly get our work done.

And we’re the only club I know of who has three callers in our club!  We plan to feature them calling next year.

We revel in our history.  At our inception, we were the only club in the tri-county area that would allow single dancers to join!
