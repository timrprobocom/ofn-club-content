M&M's are celebrating their 38th birthday on November 19th. It will be a Floor Level Dance with Randy calling and Jeanine cueing.  Mainstream and Plus dancers are heartily welcome to attend.  Please come help us celebrate with dancing, cake and ice cream.  Oh, and remember that we no longer have any COVID related rules or restrictions in place.
