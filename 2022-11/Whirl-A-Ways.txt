It's been a long two years for Whirl-A-Ways!  We are happy to be back dancing at the hall in Springfield!  We dance the second and third Saturdays.  Our first dances for the new dance season were September 10 and 17.  Mike Kious is the caller. Christina Corelli is the cuer.  Please come and join us!  7:00 is Plus and then Mainstream and rounds begin at 7:30.

I'm sorry to let you know that the October 8 dance had to be cancelled because Mike Kious was in a three-car accident up in the Portland area and is recuperating.  We pray he is well soon and back to calling.  We are all concerned for Mike and Camille too.  This is too scary!
    
Our cuer's new husband, Jake Westra, is taking square dance lessons from Roger Putzler.  That would be so cool to add him to our Whirl-A-Ways roster! 

All dances and classes are at the Emerald Dance Center, 2095 Yolanda in Springfield.
 
Happy dancing!
