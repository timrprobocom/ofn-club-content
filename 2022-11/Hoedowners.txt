Ever heard of Christmas in July?  This year we’re having July in September.  What a blissful month it was, wonderful weather, 70’s and 80’s, beautiful sunsets, farmer’s markets still full of fresh produce.  Crazy as it may seem, we started our fall lessons on September 13th.  We started with students and angels filling the floor. Craig Abercrombie is the instructor and he had everyone out on the floor, in squares, dancing by the end of the evening!!  Each week we’ve had more new and renewal students.

We did have our regular dances on the September 10th and 24th. On September 10th Scott Zinser was our caller and on the 24th it was Jim Hattrick. Randy Lewis is our regular cuer but he’s having a hip rebuilt. We’ll see him back as soon as he’s able.

What’s coming up in November with Hoedowners at the Aloha Grange? Lessons every Tuesday evening for our new students and a brush up for all you experienced dancers. And on November 12th, we’ll have Scott Zinser and maybe Randy Lewis, On November 26th K.C. Curtis will call and Randy Lewis will cue.

Hope to see you there.
