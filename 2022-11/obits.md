10/17/1930 - 10/22/2022 

Patty Bonney started square dancing in the 1970’s and after lessons joined the Circulating Singles and then later Single On Saturday (SOS).  In 1984 she became a charter member of the Mix and Mingle Square Dance Club (M&M’s) serving on the Board many times over in every office except Treasurer (“you can’t pay me to do that job”).  Patty was a regular on 1st and 3rd Saturdays at the M&M’s and during the week she danced Advanced and C-1 as well.  When she decided she shouldn’t be driving her car any more  she took the bus!  Family was very important to Patty and she talked often of her 5 grown children, her grandchildren and great grandchildren.  Her Church was important to her, too and she always looked forward to attending their Family Camp every year.
    
Patty died from heart failure on October 22 just 5 days after her 92nd birthday.  We’ll miss seeing her walk into the Grange with her backpack (stuffed with a book to read and her current knitting project to work on), wearing her holiday socks and carrying a tin of her home baked cookies for the dancers to enjoy.  She will remain a part of the heart of the M&M’s and fondly remembered by those who knew her.
