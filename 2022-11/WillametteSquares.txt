Willamette Squares enjoyed our monthly dance in September. We had our annual Oktoberfest dance, which is always fun, and we served Oktoberfest sausage with the traditional German flair including cream puffs.

Our birthday dance is coming up Sunday afternoon October 23. We will be celebrating our 28th year and invite all square dancers to join us. We would love to have a big birthday party, and we need all of you to make it possible. 

Just an early reminder that due to the conflict with Christmas Eve, Willamette Squares will be dark in December. In the meantime, we will have our dancinâ€™ shoes on and dancing the hours away at the Salem Square Dance Center. We hope to see you in a square.
