September was a super busy month for our club!  Our normal Mainstream Dance on September 3rd was a thank-you and celebration to Julie and Mike Stout for their years calling and cueing for us and their wonderful friendship.  We had a Hawaiian theme with ice cream and cupcakes served.  The dance was well attended with more than 4 squares.  This was the last night for Julie to cue.  Our Mainstream Dance  held on September 17th was the last dance that Mike Stout called with Randy Lewis cueing. The club did a visitation to Tri Squares on September 22nd for their 24th anniversary, there were just over 4 squares.  Thank-you to Leslie Tallman and Johnny Semm for planning and organizing visitations this year.  Plus dances were held on Thursday the 1st, 15th and 29th  with Darrell Kalmbach calling and Tami Helms cueing.  The club had a campout on the weekend of September 9-11th at Wapiti RV resort.  It was a great time with more than 40 people in attendance!

Our new officers, having taken their new roles in June, are doing an excellent job.  I would like to highlight Ed Mickelson, our VP,  for doing not only our monthly newsletter but he is also doing a weekly touch bases email to keep us all informed about the upcoming week.  In addition, he and a team from the club have been reviewing all of our By-Laws.  Thank-you Ed!
