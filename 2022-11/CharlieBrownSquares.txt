We had a couple of squares and some visitors from CA at our dance on Oct 15th. Thank you Chuck and Sarge for calling/cueing. Our SSD dance on the 14th had about 12 dancers. 
Our November Dances are on the 5th & 19th w/Roger & Sarge and Chuck & Elaine. Look for flyers in this issue of OFN.

Our 55th birthday dance is approaching and we will have Randy Dibble calling and Rikki cueing - this is on Dec 3rd - Advanced and all levels of dancing. The flyer is under "Special Dances."

Our Tuesday SSD class is going well with 14 students. We are still offering MS Funshop & Plus class on Thursdays starting at 630pm.
Ribbons are available for Boatnik Memorial Weekend 2023 - we are excited to have Joe Saltel back and welcome Randy/Marie Preskitt for the 1st time.  Let the club know if you need flyers or ribbons. 

Wishing everyone the start of a wonderful Holiday Season and we hope to see you on the dance floor soon!
