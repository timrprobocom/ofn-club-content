We were sorry to have to cancel our dance on Sunday, Oct. 2 because we had some dancers out with COVID or having been exposed to COVID.  Since we dance with normally just one square on the floor, we cannot dance when some members have to cancel out.  We hope to have two more dances in October on the 16th and 30th.  We are particularly looking forward to dancing to a live caller, Kris Jensen from New Mexico, who will call Oct. 30 for us in the afternoon and for Spin Cycle Squares in the late afternoon.  She is a terrific caller so if you are in the vicinity, please join us.  It is always best to call to make sure we are dancing before driving any distance.  Call Fred Beisse at 458-221-3564 or Gaynor Hintz (541) 741-4149.

Our dances are held from 1:30-3:30 in Hall B behind the Emerald Square Dance Center at 20th and Yolanda in Springfield.  We generally dance twice a month when we have enough for at least one square with some spares.  Our tentative dance schedule can be found at cas-sd.yolasite.com.

Advanced is a lot of fun and good for oneâ€™s brain and body.  Come join us.
