Is your closet bulging at the seams?  Are you hankering to recycle some of your square dance or round dance clothes?  Or, have you moved on and are no longer able to join in the festivities.

Well, Mid-Winter Festival is fast approaching.  For many of you it provides an opportunity to recycle a few or many of those outfits taking up space in your closets.  For others, it is a sad time when you are saying, “I just can’t dance anymore”, and you want someone else to enjoy those beautiful outfits you have received so much pleasure wearing over the years.

But first let’s look closely at some key tips to selling your clothing items at Mid-Winter Festival 2023.  Follow closely the online instructions and email your list of items in by January 17, 2023.  

<b>Note:</b>  If you are having any problems completing the form online, then by all means hand write it and mail it in.  We will input it to the computer for you.  Please email or call Sheila for assistance.

<b><i>If you snail mail your list, it must be received by January 10, 2023.</i></b>

Please, read the instructions very, very carefully.

Make sure the items are clean and in good repair. Square and Round dance clothing only, please.

Bring your items, listed by categories to simplify the tagging process for you to the consignment tables. Labels will be printed in the order that you have numbered them on the submission form. 

If you have sets, keep/place them together.  This will help you with the tagging process and may even help them to sell.

Please, be early to consignment.  Be sure to check the hours and plan on Thursday afternoon (3:00 pm) or Friday morning (9:00 am) so they will be prominently placed on the racks for the opening sales activity Friday evening.
As with so many activities it is getting more and more difficult to get volunteers to help.  Resale Clothing is one of those areas that require a large number of volunteers to make it available for all the dancers.  

We can no longer accept clothing items at the festival that were not listed for consignment before the input deadline.  We are sorry it has come to this.  But we hope you will utilize the online submission process.  Or you can hand write it and send it to us.  Just print out the input/submission sheet for completion by hand.  We want to help you recycle the many beautiful outfits that you all have.
 
As I said earlier we require a large number of volunteers to assist during consignment and sale hours.  We will accept any help, even if for just one (1) hour.  So, contact the chair for Resale Clothing – Sheila - and let her know you want to help.

Don’t forget to pick up your returns by 10:00 a.m. on Sunday morning.

For assistance contact the following individual -- preferably by email. 
 
Sheila Machado at sheilainsalem@hotmail.com or if you must call my phone at 
503-884-0158.

Yes, retiring. After over a half century looking for, and most of the time finding the corner, I think it’s time to pack it in.

I’ve always said, “I have no intention of ever quitting calling, but it might quit me.” I can’t help but feel that’s what’s happening. Over two and a half years sitting on my butt waiting for the pandemic to end, having a wife that needed constant care and supervision, and turning 81 years of age, I’m finding it hard to commit, not just to myself, but just to meeting the challenges of taking care of life.

Life? Let’s talk about it. My life has been blessed and filled with things that most people, especially callers, only dream about.

Yvonne and I celebrated 60 years of being partners in life. Some of you might have been there with us when we celebrated our fiftieth wedding anniversary, ten years ago.

We were blessed with three children that grew and prospered. We also have grandkids and great-grandkids that I am going to enjoy as much as possible (darned pandemic).

Calling? When I picked up a microphone for the first time, I had absolutely no idea of where calling square dances was about to take me. After a 10-week, 2 hours a week course, I graduated and got myself a badge that said “Caller.” I started by teaching a square and a half of friends how to dance, and with very little experience, was hired by two other clubs.

Within just a few years I was traveling out of state for weekends and festivals. During that happy and exciting time, I was asked to do a vocal recording. My first record was “Country Mind, Country Heart” On Greenwood Square Dance Records. Produced by one of our own, Les Roberts. What an honor.

I was privileged in 1975 to be invited to attend the second annual CALLERLAB Convention and have served on the board of governors and Executive Committee. Today, I am a “Gold Card Member.”

I also founded my own two record labels in which I produced hundreds of square and round dance records.

During those first twelve or so years of calling, I also worked the pipe trades while calling dances, classes, and workshops three or four nights a week. Add to that, traveling out for far too many weekends.

In 1987 I was invited to be the resident winter-time caller for a resort in Arizona. I spent the next sixteen winters calling up to three times a day, and six days a week, for the snowbirds. When I decided to retire from that marathon calling in 2003, I had programs in five different Resorts. Those sixteen years exposed me to dancers and callers from all over the world. You can’t buy advertising like that. Everything just “snowballed.”

Winters in Arizona and Summers on the road. In 1989 on my summer road trip returning from the East Coast, I had a heart issue in Rapid City, SD. I recovered from that and went south for the winter. I made it through that winter season in time to fly home for by-pass surgery. I guess it went well because I’m still here 32 years later.

I ended my Snowbird winters at the seasons’ end in 2003. That also pretty much ended my road-work as well. It was time to settle back home in Portland and once again be a “Club Caller.”

I am also proud of the fact that I am one of the earliest CALLERLAB Accredited Caller Coaches and have been involved in caller training for all but a few years of being a caller.

It has been my privilege to call and conduct caller training in most of the U.S. States and Canadian Provinces. Along with, The Yukon Territory, Puerto Rico, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, England, Norway, Denmark, and many others. I can’t prove it, but I believe that I was the first to actually call a dance on the Great Wall of China.

What a life. So many wonderful experiences. I have had the pleasure of working with some of the real legends of the Modern Western Square Dance Activity. Some of them are still living and I try to stay in touch with them.

The dancers? That’s what I’m going to miss most. Some of my greatest moments have been with people that have become extended family through the dancing. Not just here in Oregon, but all over the world.

It seems funny to say but some of my most memorable moments, good and bad, have been Square Dance related. Callers and dancers that I have taught, played, and worked with through the years have made what I call “my Life.”

I will not sell all my equipment. I will remain available to help any caller or dancer that needs my help. In an emergency I will be ready to fill-in where needed.

Thank you Portland. Thank you Oregon. Thank you All the States and Foreign Countries. Thank you all the Dancers, Callers and Round Dance Cuers, local and international, that have treated me so well. Thank you Mom and Dad for all of your early influence. Thank you to my family that has supported me for all these years and think I should keep going. I wish I could.

I apologize to anyone that I may have offended along the way. I love you all, and this old used-up Caller says, “thank you and farewell.”
