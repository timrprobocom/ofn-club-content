If this is out in time, you can still catch our 5th Saturday dance on October 29th, which is all Plus dancing.  George and Patti Hermann will be the caller and cuer. Remember we dance 1st, 4th, and 5th Saturdays at the Boring Barn. 1st and 4th
Saturday dances start with Plus level at 7:00 PM, followed by Mainstream and 
rounds. We will be dancing Thanksgiving weekend, November 26th, so if you are in town and need to burn off some calories, come join us, Scott Zinser calling.

The Country Cut-Ups are thankful for all who attended our Pancake Breakfast and Bazaar in October. We have decided to collect items for our annual spring Barn Sale, so you can look forward to that.

We are thankful to have a Mainstream class going on Thursday nights at 7:30 PM, so come on out and help angel lessons, especially if you need a refresher.
