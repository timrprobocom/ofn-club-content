R Square D began lessons in early September with fourteen students. Our booth at Squirrel Fest in August paid off, because two of the students found out about our lessons there.

We had our annual campout at Vista Park in Skamokawa in September – not as many camped over the weekend, but we had 23 there on Saturday afternoon for a club meeting and to enjoy a meal together afterwards.

November 11th is our “Veteran’s Day Dance” with Craig Abercrombie calling and Susan Healea cueing.  As we have done in past years, veterans will get in free at this dance. It’s also a class-level dance (plus dancing the first hour and class-level calling for the rest of the dance). We hope to have many students in attendance! 

Craig and Susan will again call/cue a “Gospel Dance” on November 26th. This dance is two days after Thanksgiving, so come and dance off some of that pumpkin pie!
