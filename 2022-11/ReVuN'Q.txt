Our Thursday evenings were cut short by two weeks so our cuer, Randy Lewis, could recuperate enough from his hip surgery that he could walk with the aid of a crutch and drive. So, we only danced three out of the five weeks available. We are dancing and reviewing what we already know and walking through anything that gives us fits. 
We surprised Randy the day after his 70th birthday with chocolate cake during a break. He enjoyed every bite and the smile in appreciation was a just reward. He got to go home with a little bit of leftover cake after the rest of us got our share on plates. Enjoyable way to enjoy a break.

The beginning round dance class that the club is sponsoring has a good attendance of 9.5 couples. We have lost one couple due to a personal injury and we are surprised and pleased that they are sticking with us. We seem to be explaining moves to their satisfaction and they just got their first full song on 10/2. So onward and upward. We are doing this by the seat of our pants since I have never cued, and Molly has never taught. We seem to mesh well together and are enjoying the challenge.
