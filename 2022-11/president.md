Dancer Etiquette

Why do we go to Square & Round Dances? It’s to relax & enjoy ourselves, right? So, when we arrive at the dance and walk in the door, there are people who greet you, there are the Caller & Cuer set up on stage ready to provide entertainment for you. Their goal is to see that you enjoy yourselves and come away feeling good about the event.

Putting on a dance is a complex affair. There are many elements that need to be accomplished to have a successful dance.  The club hosting the dance must have a hall, seek volunteers to take care of the details, hire Callers & Cuers and promote the dance. The dancers must know there is a dance and be interested enough to come. The Caller & Cuer spend time outside of the dance preparing programs and rehearsing to provide entertainment for the dancers.

What if that does not happen? What if the greeters aren’t interested in your presence, what if the Caller or the Cuer does not meet your expectations? How should you respond?  You certainly can express your opinions to all present and elicit the same from others. Do you believe that would be wise?

There will be times when a dance may not live up to your expectations. Here is something to consider. Will it help to spend time expressing your discontent about your personal view of the dance to others at the dance? You certainly can do that, but should you? It is my belief that the primary reason that a person comes to a dance is to have some respite from everyday problems and to leave the dance feeling good. What I am certain of is, that complaining to others at the dance about the greeters, other dancers or Caller & Cuer will definitely not do that. The better part of valor is discretion. It is just common courtesy.

So, after reading this, I would like you to do your best to ensure that you present a positive presence at every dance that you may attend. It may not be always as you expect, but that needn’t be expressed at the dance. If the problem is significant, then I would hope that you take the time to express that issue to the Club officers in confidence.
