Braids and Braves, though dark for the summer, have been busy doing demos at Amity and McMinnville and planning for fall classes.  

We had a great picnic at Nate and Jennie Ramerâ€™s in June and we're looking forward to our club Camp-out at the beach. We will be getting back to our monthly club dances on the third Saturday beginning in September. We love to have visitors!
