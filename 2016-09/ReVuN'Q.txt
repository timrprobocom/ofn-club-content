Our club finished Tango lessons and spent August doing mostly workshops on various rhythms and working on a few pesky steps. We have had two guest cuers in the form of Jeanine Norden and Christina Corelli in July and Jeanine Norden will return in August while Cheryl goes to USAWest. They have been great fun and we laughed at silly things while they were there.
We are having an ice cream dance on the first Thursday of September to celebrate the end of summer. The following week will start Fox Trot lessons in workshops or beginning, depending on the variety of students we get the first couple of nights. We will continue Tango from where we left off in July, on the second Thursday in September in the third hour of the evening.  
We are always open to visitors and we dance on Thursdays from 6:30-9:30. Lessons are from 7:30-8:20 p.m. Marilyn Schmit
