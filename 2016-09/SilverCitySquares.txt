Well, we're back dancing this month! Our September dance is a Hawaiian Pie Night with casual attire and pies with ice cream at break. If it is a hot day, dancing will be downstairs in the cool basement.
 
Lessons start on Tuesday September 13 and we are hoping for a good turnout of students.
 
We danced in the Homer Davenport Parade August 6. Everyone who danced enjoyed themselves very much.
 
When you come to see us, be alert as the hall was painted by the Waldo Hills Community Club over the summer. It is now a light yellow with brown trim. If you are looking for a white building, you might miss it!
 
We are proud to announce that Thomas Buchheit received the United Square Dancers of America scholarship for $1,000 this year. Marilyn Schmit accepted it for him at Nationals. See you at a dance soon! Petrina Buchheit
