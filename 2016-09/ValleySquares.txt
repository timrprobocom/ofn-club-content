September ushers in football season and we celebrate our many great teams in Oregon with our Tailgate Dance and chicken barbecue September 17th.  Please join us to savor the luscious barbecued chicken prepared by our chefs Larry, Tony & Joy.  Dinner at 6:15, Mainstream with rounds 7-9, Plus at 9.  Daryl Clendenin is scheduled to call with Connie Clark.  We also welcome you to our dance September 3.  Darrell Kalmbach will be calling that one.
 Want to strengthen your Mainstream skills and learn All Position and Dance By Definition?  Perhaps you women may even want to learn the opposite part so you have more choices at dances and less time on the sidelines.  Join us in our Mastering Mainstream Class taught by Darrell Kalmbach starting September 13th, 7 p.m. at Aloha Grange.  We will brush up on Mainstream before moving on to the more challenging choreography.
 We finished our Basics lessons in July.  What a nice bunch of students, running from 9 year olds through grandparents.
 Members had a great time dancing on the Newberg Tennis Courts to the calling and cueing of Randy Dibble and Julie Stiers in our July Visitation.  
 We are grateful to Terry Halley and Ian Craig for stepping in as guest callers during our July dances.
