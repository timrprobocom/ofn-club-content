 The TVC hosted the Summer Festival in Seaside July 29th to 31st.  Andy Allemeo and Dave Cooper were the featured caller and cuer, both doing a fantastic job.  Additionally our talented local callers and cuers donated their time to help make this a wonderful weekend.  The weather was very pleasant, allowing about 5 squares to dance on the beach.  Many thanks go to Kay Rogers for her tireless efforts in making the Festival happen.  The scheduling for the callers and cuers was done by Daryl Clendenin, who as Kay said, worked above and beyond making her job so much easier.
 Andy threw some intricate stuff at both the Mainstream and the Plus dancers and commented from the stage that he was impressed that the floor did as well as they did.  He said that the level he saw was a testament to the excellent callers and cuers we have in the area.
 The next TVC event will be the Tri-Council Dance on October 29th. This fifth Saturday dance will be held at the Clark County Square Dance Center in Vancouver Washington and will be hosted by the Evergreen Council. More details next month.
