We dance Sundays from 5:30 - 8:00.  We had one new dancer, Kathy Peters, who learned with seven angels in the square!   We've been getting more and more people out to our Sunday dances.  Tim Matteson is our caller/teacher and is great at any level from beginner through advanced.  Tim is also learning challenge along with a couple of other Spin Cycle Squares members. 
 
We had elections recently and have retained most of the board who were willing to run again.  David Lajoie is president, Kurt Jensen is vice-president, Lorna Mercer is treasurer, and our one new officer is Cheryl Hagey (Tim) who is our new secretary.  Christina Corelli is member-at-large.  A lot of our business can be taken care of at our dances.  Some of the meetings have been held at Christina and Kirby's place in Eugene. 
 
We look forward to a new dance season.  Come and join us Sunday evenings at the Emerald dance center in Springfield at 5:30. 
 
Happy dancing, Christina Corelli, Member-at-large
