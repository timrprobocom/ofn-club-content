We have been busy with demos this summer â€&ldquo; Relay for Life in Bandon and Coos Bay, the Coos County Fair in Coquille and the July Jubilee Parade in North Bend.  This month we will be dancing in the Fun Festival Parade in Coos Bay, which will be the 17th of Sept.  We have been getting names of spectators at these demos who have expressed interest in attending our class and will follow up with phone calls.

Our new class starts the second Sunday in September and we will welcome back our caller, Sherm Welch, who has been on vacation these past two months.  Thanks go out to our new area callers who have been filling in for him.
