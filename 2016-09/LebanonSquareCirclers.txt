Our Strawberry Festival was a great success -- three days of dancing, potlucks, experienced clothing sales, silent auction and Sunday breakfast. Our club participated in the Lebanon Strawberry Festival parade and it was the hottest weekend in June. But it all went well.   

 Our club had a gathering at Nick and Kaynor Heineck's home on June 26 for a garden party/meeting; lots of croquet, potluck, garden tour, and end-of-year reports. It was not so hot that weekend so it was very pleasant in the Heineck's gorgeous yard.  

 We are looking forward to the Labor Day gathering at Frank and Marianne Cawrse's farm. As usual, there will be potlucks, lots of game playing and dancing to the "Silo Caller" (Charlotte Jeskey calls dances from the top of the silo on the farm.)  What fun it will be! 

Our club is getting ready for another year of fun and dancing under the leadership of Wanda Frenzel - President, Frank Cawrse - V.P., Kaynor Heineck - Sec., and Barb Newton - Treas. See you in a square!  Marilyn York
