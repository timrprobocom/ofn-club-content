Willamette Squares held a wonderful end of July dance at the Salem Square Dance Center. The theme was "Fun in the Sun," and there were plenty of reminders of playing and relaxing in the sun. Along the front of the stage was a chaise lounge, beach towel, two beach umbrellas, kiddies wading pool, a drink glass, sunglasses, sunscreen, and a plastic bucket with shovels. On the tables were green tablecloths, small beach balls, sunkist yellow and orange wrapped hard candy balls, and pop bottles containing colorful zinnias and dahlias. It was easy to imagine ourselves at the ocean or lake. Of course, the food was, as always, delicious and plentiful!  All that was missing was the campfire. The dancing was lively and fun, and the camaraderie great! 

Willamette Squares will be enjoying the annual summer picnic with good food and dancing. We hope to see you there! Jodee Howard
