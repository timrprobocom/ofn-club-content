July brought us an excellent Hawaiian Beach Party dance with Terry Halley doing some awesome calling and Jackie Gale cueing with her "get up and dance" round dance rhythms. We gave out year badges (5, 10, 15, and 20) to four members, and a Single Trees token to visitors from San Luis Obispo, California. What a neat surprise! And our 2nd July dance was called by Lennie Ludiker. We had some visitors and a fun time learning a few "old time" moves.

If "ya all" look at this before August 26th - you'll see we have our Western Hoedown dance with Jim Voll calling. So put on your duds and come and dance with us to round out your summer festivities.

September brings us the start of a new dance year and a new caller for our second Friday dances - Jim Hattrick is braving the long drive to Springfield to keep us in first class dancing mode for the year. In honor of having Jim as our caller, this big celebration dance will be free to all on September 9th! So come join us in welcoming him and make it a grand occasion.

On September 23rd, Craig Abercrombie and Al Frazier will delight us with songs to keep our feet stomping. It's our Fabulous 50's! dance. So dress back in time and strut your stuff. We love visitors.
