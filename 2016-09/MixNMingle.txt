Long time readers of this column will remember when I wrote about people coming to dances wearing a scent strong enough to cause allergic reactions in others and of our having to refund dancers’ money because of it. 
 People who wear strong fragrances all the time probably don’t realize that their perfume/cologne may be too strong for others. If you have a question as to whether the scent you are wearing is too strong, check with someone before going to the dance and ask for an opinion. That can keep a square from breaking down because one or more dancers can’t dance with their nasal passages plugged.
