R Square D has been enjoying the lazy days of summer.  On July 13th everyone broke out their fanciest Denim clothing and 4 squares of dancers kicked it up to the calling of Steve Noseck with Lonnie Sycks cueing.  Good visits were had from the clubs of Harbor Haylofters and Cougar squares.  The evening was cooled off with Ice cream sundaes. 
 On July 27th we honored the heat of the month with a Hot Summer Nights dance.  Plenty of heat was offered up by Craig Abercrombieâ€™s calling and Lonnie Sycks Cueing.  Four squares kept the floor moving with visitations from Harbor Haylofters, Cougar Squares and Stardust dancers.  Dancers enjoyed root beer floats in the cool of the hot summer night. 
 R Square D will go back to its regular schedule in September.  The first dance will be on Friday September 9th and it will be a Crazy Necktie Dance, It will be fun to see what shows up for this dance.  Saturday, September 24th will be our Harvest dance as we welcome in Autumn.  Dance times will be Plus from 7:00- 8:00 with mainstream from 8:00 -10:00.
