We had a wonderful time at the Summer Festival this year.  The weather cooperated too.
 We, the Hayshakers, continue to have dances twice a month with the help of the Wave Steppers and we help them out when they dance once a month.  We now have an open policy, if you will, that anyone who is interested in learning to dance, we go ahead and have them come to the dances and have them dance half the time.  Hopefully we will get a few new people join our club.  Remember the 4th weekend in October.  The Seaside Sashay is the 21st & 22nd of October.  Come join the fun.
