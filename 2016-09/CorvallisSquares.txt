The Corvallis Squares has had opportunities for a couple of demo dances to raise awareness and show how fun square dancing is. We danced at the Benton County Fair and at the Grace Center. 

Our mainstream lessons will start on Monday evenings beginning on Sept. 26 at 7 p.m. Bruce Lowther will be our instructor.

Our club is planning a potluck and meeting at Joseph and Cynthia's in August, to reconnect and gear up for the fall. We look forward to kicking off the dance season on Sept. 10! Karen
