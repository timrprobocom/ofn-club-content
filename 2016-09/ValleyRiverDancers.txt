The Valley River Dancers had a busy July with the 4th of July St. Paul Rodeo Parade, the Newberg Old Fashioned Festival Parade, and our wildly popular Dance Under the Stars. Our split the pot was a whopping $67, and coincidentally Randy celebrated his 67th birthday the same weekend; in an amazing gesture, winners Robin and Rick Faltersack gifted the pot to Randy to kick off his special weekend. Square dancers never cease to amaze. 

Speaking of events, join us Friday, August 26, for our luau dance. Randy Dibble is calling and Julie Stiers is cueing. We will have a half hour of plus before we do the mainstream hula!

Thank you, dancers, for joining us -- you make our events really fun.
