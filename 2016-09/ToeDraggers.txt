What a beautiful summer we have had.  Dancing in the summertime is so much fun.  We were so proud of KC and Linda working hard at Summer Festival down in Seaside.  What a beautiful weekend.
 Toe’s summer campout down in Lincoln City this August was a blast.  Thanks Jerri and Doug Reese for getting it organized and giving us a tremendous weekend.  We always bring back such great memories from our times together as a club.
 September is moving along with our new officers setting up our year schedule and activities.  Square dance classes will begin on Wednesday nights in September.  Check the Toe Dragger’s website for time and dates.  Classes will be held at the Kinton Grange. Round Dance lessons will begin in January with Bev and Harlan, also at our grange.  Speaking of the grange, a new activity has been established for everyone to come and enjoy. Come and bring dancing and non- dancing friends.  The Kinton Country Antique Faire will be going on Sunday Sept. 11th from 9 to 4 p.m.  So many fun items to stop by and see and buy. The proceeds go towards helping the grange to stay open for all community activities, including square dancing.  We love our Kinton Grange. See you in a square.
