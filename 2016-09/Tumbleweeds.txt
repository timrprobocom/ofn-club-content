Our club was saddened and shocked by the death of Bob Bishop. Bob was a member of our club for many years.  He was president and most likely served in other positions. Most of our members went to the memorial dance.

Yesterday we learned that Rene Cole broke her hip and is in a Home for therapy.  We will miss her smiling face at our dances.  She has danced with us for many years as well many other groups.  

We had our picnic at Stringfield Park.  Our picnic was a combined with the Grotto Masons.  We had fun visiting with the other group. A group of us went for a walk on one of the trails. The wildlife we saw included: a nutria ,many  ducks ,osprey, even an eagle.

Many visitors joined us dancing in our air conditioned hall.  We went on a fun visitation to the BnBs.  More visitations are being planned.
