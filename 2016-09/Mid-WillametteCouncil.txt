Many thanks to the Summer Festival Committee for another successful event! Our Council is looking forward to hosting next summerâ€™s Summer Festival in Salem. Hope to see many of you there. 

We are sad to report that the Salem Square Dance Center was again broken into and some things stolen. This is the second time in recent months. It is hard to understand why these things happen.  

Congratulations to our own Thomas Buchheit of the Silver City Squares for being awarded a $1000.00 scholarship from National. Well deserved, Thomas!
