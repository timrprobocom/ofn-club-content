The Whirl-A-Ways will be returning to our regularly scheduled dances beginning September 10th.  For many years the club has gone dark for July and August to allow the dancers to vacation and visit other clubs and festivals around the State.

We look forward to a fun year as Camille Durbec and her team set up dances with special themes.  Be on the lookout for more information from Camille.  She may even have a surprise of two for club members and visitors.  She is challenging the club members to get out of their comfort zone this year and do some more visitations.  I am sure we will hear more about that.

Whirl-A-Ways like most clubs has to have itâ€™s business meetings throughout the year.  Our first one will be a potluck at the Emerald Square Dance Center on Sunday evening, September 18th.  Club members should look for more through the newsletter and other announcements.

We look forward to the start of a great year of dancing and fellowship time with so many of you. Hope to see you all on the dance floor.
