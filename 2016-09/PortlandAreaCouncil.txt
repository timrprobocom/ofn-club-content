Our council is closely watching the Country Cut-Ups and the results they are having.   As of late, they are in the midst of community involvement.  They are participating in town and community affairs such as their recent “Dull and Boring Day”.  They’ve made a special point to invite the community to dance lessons (no charge) just to watch the lessons.  They are also having “open house” at their barn, simply to invite the community in and show that the barn is open to the public, and exactly what is inside of the mysterious barn that is seen from the street.  Unlike the fraternal clubs, it really is open to all.

Not too far behind are the Buzzin’ Bees, who have invited the community to come to a mini lesson and learn about eight moves, and have a dance based upon those moves.  Reportedly, this has been very successful in California.

And we cannot forget about the Chaps & Petticoats, who will be participating in the Aurora Colony Days Parade.

That’s the key:  community involvement.  It keeps our hobby in the limelight and our camaraderie within our club.
