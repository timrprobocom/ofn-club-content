After having been "dark" for the Summer, it's September and the Happy Hoppers are excited to be back!  

The highpoint of the summer season, our annual club picnic took place on Sunday, August 7, at Don and Joanne Oja's farm.  Touching bases with old friends was the order of the day.

On July 23, members Pauline and Walt Eby were honored as the Royal Couple in the Camas Days Parade, which was quite an honor for a couple very deserving of the recognition.

Our new club president is Melissa James, who is developing a reputation for being a dynamo and a natural born leader.  Thank you, Melissa, for stepping up to the plate!

The Happy Hoppers work hard to make our education program a comfortable environment for students.  Our tireless club vice-presidents, Liza and Tom Halpenny, will once again be coordinating this program for this next year.  Many of our club members volunteer as "Angels" to help make it an easy and productive  experience.  Square dance lesson season will re-start on Monday, September 12 at the Clark County Square Dance Center.  We are committed to serving both beginners and continuing students with our lesson format.  Every Monday, Plus lessons will be given at 6:30, Basic lessons start at 7:30, and Mainstream lessons are available at 9:00.  

As always, we have Plus dances on the first and third Saturdays of the month at the Clark County Square Dance Center, with our club caller/cuer, Jim Hattrick.  This month, it is the 3rd and the 17th.  Pre-rounds start at 7:30, with squares at 8:00.  Our "Back to School" dance will take place on September 3.  We collect school supplies to donate to a local elementary school for student who need them.  

The future of our venue, the Clark County Square Dance Center is still very much up in the air.  A sale is pending, but before that can be culminated, there is some litigation taking place about property boundaries.
