<p>With summer winding down, many clubs will be starting up lessons in September. &nbsp;Please take a moment to make sure your club's lesson information is correct, and not just something leftover from last year. &nbsp;Remember that you can attach a flyer to your lessons just like you do with your dances.</p>
<p>A brand new set of Federation officers will take over at the Federation meeting on September 18. &nbsp;I'll highlight that set next month.</p>
<p>All of the clubs and councils in the Federation have received an equal portion of the donation from the estate of Susan Corbett. &nbsp;Many clubs have asked for an address to send a note of appreciation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Estate of Susan Corbett<br />c/o Debbie Knierim<br />14170 SW Barlow Rd<br />Beaverton, OR &nbsp; 97008</p>
