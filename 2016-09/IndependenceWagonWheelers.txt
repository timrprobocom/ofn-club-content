Now that we have had the month of August dark, we are ready to start dancing again.  Remember that we are changing our dance times starting with our September dance.  Our dance times will be pre-rounds (our first dance of the month) or pre-plus (our second dance of the month) at 7:00 p.m. and our dance will be held from 7:30 to 10:00 p.m.

We will be hosting a Sock Hop at our dance on the second Saturday of September.  Find our flyer in this issue for some of the added experiences we will be offering at the dance. Happy Dancing!  Linda Neuschwander
