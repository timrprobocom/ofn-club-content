The Wave Steppers’ September dance (Saturday, Sept. 10th) will be an “Elvis Dance” (it’s also our Anniversary Dance), with caller Mark Wheeler as Elvis, and cueing by Connie Clark.  October’s “Fall Dance” Oct. 8th -- our last dance of the season -- will have club caller Joe Wrabek, and line dancing with Gwen Kiel.  Dancing starts at 7 p.m.
The Wave Steppers’ dances are held at Garibaldi City Hall, 107 Sixth Street (just a block off US 101, 9 miles north of Tillamook).  About two-thirds of the second floor of City Hall is a dance floor, built in the 1940s for the old Firemen’s Balls.
 A new round of square dance classes will begin in September, taught by club caller Joe Wrabek; these are on Wednesdays, 6 to 8 p.m. at the Tillamook Elks Lodge, 1907 Third St. in downtown Tillamook.  Classes are free.
