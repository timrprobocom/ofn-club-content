The Sunset Promenaders had a “Hot Diggity Dog” dance on July 2nd and it was well attended and fun.  After our dance we had the “All American Hot Dogs” at the break and they were good. 
 July 7th we had Darrell Kalmbach calling and a guest cuer Lonnie Sycks and as usual we all had fun.
 We enjoyed the Summer Festival in Seaside Convention Center on July29th & 30th.  It is was a lot of fun and was cooler weather compared to the Portland area.  The Seaside Convention Center is the same place the Seaside Sashay will be held this October 21st and 22nd.  Now would be a good time for people to get signed up for the Sashay including getting some lodging reserved.  Call 503-848-3841 for registration form and information.
 In September we are looking forward to the “Apple Everything” dance on the 17th.  Come visit us; join us for a good time with Mike Stout calling and Ken Pratt cueing.
 This month we are having three Promenaders Plus dances; September 1st, 15th, 29th.  Come enjoy Darrell Kalmbach, and Ken Pratt calling and cueing.
