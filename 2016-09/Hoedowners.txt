July always starts off with a bang and celebration on the 4th and the Hoedowners kept the celebratory mood going all month.  On the 9th we celebrated our 50th state, Hawaii, with a Luau themed dance.  The ballroom was adorned with grass skirts, leis and tiki.  What other state has its very own style of clothing?  The dance floor was filled with dancers dressed in a myriad of colors with hibiscus, palm trees, surf boards, plumeria, shells, waves and sunsets.  Tropical is as tropical does; a cool, relaxing, enjoyable evening. 
 On the 23rd we celebrated that great American beverage root beer with our annual Root Beer Float Dance.  What is the ingredient in root beer that gives it that unique taste; sassafras.  Root beer is the peanut butter of the beverage world; only North Americans seem to like it.  The ice cream must definitely be frozen and the root beer icy cold but the debate continues, which goes in the glass first, ice cream or root beer?  It was a lively group enjoying a summer evening. 
 The Summer Festival in Seaside was a great way to celebrate the season; great fun, great music, great callers and great weather (mist doesn’t count at the coast).  Nothing says summer like sand in your shoes after dancing on the beach.  Nineteen Hoedowners gathered for dinner Saturday night and a smaller group partied under the stars after the dance.  We send a special thank you to the TVC team who put the weekend together.
 Whoa, September is coming up fast.  On the 10th, we’ll have our Back To School Dance.  Please bring school supplies to donate.  
 New dancer lessons begin Wednesday, Sept 21.  We all know what a great teacher our own Daryl Clendenin is so if you’re looking for a way to get restarted or to introduce a friend to square dancing, please join us. 
 September 24th will be our Celebrate the Harvest Dance with fresh fruit and veggies highlighting the menu.
