What was, what is and what will be.

July saw the Oaky Doaks celebrate the country’s independence from the Red Coats with our July 2nd Freedom Dance and Cookout only to welcome the back by dancing to music from such groups as the Beatles at our July 16th British Invasion dance. It found us gathering with our families for our annual picnic on the 23rd and a few of us dancing on the beach at the Summer Festival in Seaside at the end of the month.

August sees the installation of our new officers at the members meeting and cookout on August 2nd. Our first dance on August 6th is a no theme dance but the fun will still be there. The dance on August 20th is our “We are not dark” dance with a special lights out tip. So, bring your flashlights.

September will see the Oaky Doaks supporting education with our September 3rd “Back to School” dance. Visiting dancers helping us in our efforts by donating school supplies receive a $1.00 off at the door. Waltz round dance classes with Helen Halley will be starting on September 8th. So whether if you aren’t wanting try something new or refresh on what you once did, Helen will be there to help. Who’s the leader of the club? Come join us on September 17th with Mickey and friends at our Disney dance and maybe it could be you.

Are you holding an Oaky Doaks banner hostage? If so, then let us know and we will “pay” you a ransom of eight dancers to get it back. River City Dancers, Chaps and Petticoats and B & B’s we are holding at least one banner from your club. Do you have what it takes to get it back?????
