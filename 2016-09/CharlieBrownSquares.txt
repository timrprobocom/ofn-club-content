, but that doesn't mean we weren't  out dancing!  We enjoyed celebrating the Rogue Squares 1st bday dance on August 6th, and several Charlie's headed over to Sisters for The Central Oregon Roundup the following weekend.  We will be dancing at the Josephine County Fair Aug 19th & 20th; around the time the OFN is published.
We are excited for new classes starting in September. Our beginning Mainstream classes start on Tuesday, September 6th at 630pm, followed by DBD Mainstream Class.  Thursday, September 8th we will start a new  Plus class followed by a continuation of our A1 Class.  We hope to get a good group of dancers to join us in the FUN. 
We will not be having any dances the month of September at the Fairgrounds. We are dark for our 1st Saturday dance 9/3 for Labor Day.  Our 3rd Saturday dance on September 17th we will be heading to Yreka to help the Circle N Squares celebrate their birthday!
