The fall season is heating up and summer is (hopefully, weather-wise) cooling down.  We dance every month of the year on the first and third Fridays with a 5th Friday Plus Dance.  Come join us.  Our hall is air conditioned to beat the heat.  
In July we had three dances, our two regular dances and our 5th Friday Plus Dance with Randy Dibble and Christina Corelli.  Great fun was had by all who attended.

Mainstream lessons begin on Wednesday September 14 at 6:30 pm. The first two lesson dates are free. Bring your friends!!
Save the date for our upcoming Corn & Cluck Dance on September 16. I believe that we have talked The Chicken into putting in an appearance.  You do not want to miss The Chicken.  Dinner is at 7:00 p.m. Pre-rounds are at 7:30 p.m., Plus at 7:45 p.m. followed by Mainstream with Rounds 8-10:15 p.m.  Cost is $8.00 which includes dinner and dance. Flyer will be posted soon. See you all on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
