We have been having a hot time in the Boring Barn this summer! There have been lots of activities to keep us dancing. Several of our club members enjoyed the Summer Festival in Seaside while some of us held down the fort back home with a 5th Saturday dance at the end of July. Our new exhaust fan is helping the heat problem somewhat.

     All summer, we have been planning and participating in various activities to build toward our lessons starting September 15th. Much effort has been made to reach out to the community and make them aware of our existence. Soon, we will see if these efforts have paid off. If a good size class comes together, the next mission is to work on retaining them as dancers, and hopefully, new club members. None of this happens by accident, and each club member should think about how they can contribute to this effort.

    Looking toward fall, we are planning our Anniversary dance in early October and our annual Ham, Eggs, and Pancake Breakfast and Bazaar. There will some valuable items raffled off, as well. Hopefully, many of you will be there!
