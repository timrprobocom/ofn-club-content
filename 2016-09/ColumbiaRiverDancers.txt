We continue to dance through the summer but this September is going to be a rather special month in that we will be DARK BOTH SATURDAYS.  On September 10th we will be going to the Puyallup fair with some 500+ dancers.  More on this next month, but the day will be very interesting.  Then the Cloggers will take over the Grange Hall for their annual dance on the 24th.  We thought about dancing with the cloggers but some of us older folks have sore feet already and shin splints are no fun.  The club has planned a visitation that evening instead with our good friends in Kelso, the R Square D's.  Final plans may include a dinner out before the dance.
 But, not to worry! WE will be back at it in October, bigger and better than ever.  I will give everyone a heads up that we will be hosting Dan Nordbye and Julie Stiers on the 26th of November in our Turkey Burnoff dance.  As the saying goes, "Plan ahead or you may get a little behind."
 See you in a square.
