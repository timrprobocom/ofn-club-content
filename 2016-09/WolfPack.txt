The Wolf Pack's new first Saturday dance schedule begins with our Back to School Dance on Saturday, September 3rd with Sandy Harris calling and Christina Corelli cueing. 

Our friends, the Boots and Sandals, currently have no place to dance regularly, so we have asked them to cosponsor our dances starting in September until they can find a regular place to dance in Cottage Grove.
