If you’re reading this in time, you’re welcome to our Back to School dance on Aug 31.  Bring your school supplies as there are many children around our area, living in near poverty, who will be glad for the assistance.

Attendance was way down on our July 27 dance.  Many of our regulars were at Summer Festival.

Our featured callers this month are Craig Abercrombie and Al Frazier from Austin, Texas.  Curing with them will be our own Tami Helms.  This will be Sep 21.

The weather is turning cooler and we can return to our swishy skirts the guys like so much.  Come on out and dance with our eclectic group.  Be gentle on us ladies.  We don’t like to be cranked around.  If we are, we get cranky!  Club bouncer Bruce Bruiser may even have a word with you.
