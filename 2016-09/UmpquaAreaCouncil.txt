Douglas County Fair: The Buckeroos, Timber 8’s and Dancing Friends spent four nights dancing at the Douglas County Fair this month. The weather was a little more warm than we might have liked but a breeze helped keep us cool as we whirled and twirled across the dance floor. It’s always a treat to dance under the stars with the sights and sounds of the fair surrounding us. The yummy fried bread and other treats after the dance are a bonus.

Save the Date &ldquo; Veteran’s Day
Summer is winding down, so it’s time to think about fall and make a note to save the date of November 11th if you are thinking about joining us on Veteran’s Day.  We will be walking in the Roseburg Veteran’s Day parade again so dust off your red, white and blue square dance finery and head for Roseburg if you are able to join us. We also have room in the back of the truck if you would rather ride than walk.  For more info take a look at our flyer or call Frank at 541 672-0964.
