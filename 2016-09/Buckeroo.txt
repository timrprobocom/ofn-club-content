August was a super busy month for us in Roseburg.
Thirty one volunteers kicked off the first Saturday in the month by meeting at the Fair Grounds at 8am with sunscreen and water bottles in hand to construct the dance floor so we could dance in the evenings during fair week.  After three hours of loading, lifting and bending the floor was in place and the trailer was decked out as a stage with white lights looking sparkly and spiffy. 
That night, for the first time ever, the women were treated to a “Ladies’ Night Out” at the Barn.  Janienne Alexander called and Marion Cook cued. The men were in charge of making the coffee, tending to the kitchen etc. while the ladies enjoyed the night off.  Craig Allen deserves a super big pat on the back for keeping the kitchen looking spiffy along with a few other fellows.
Four evenings of dancing at the fair kept our dancers busy despite the warm weather. 
Sunday morning bright and early after the fair ended nineteen volunteers came out to pick up the floor and return it to the barn.  We also enjoyed a Watermelon Dance later in the month, and you guessed it....there was plenty of watermelon to snack on!
