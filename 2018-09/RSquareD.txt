Our summer dances have been lively events many visiting clubs have joined us regularly giving us 40-50 dancers.  Ice cream is our summer focus for break we've had floats, sundaes and shortcake.  It has been nice to have the hall air conditioned this summer.  When Craig was gone in July, Darrell Kalmbach gave us a good spin.  Thank you Darrell for always providing a fun dance.  September 22nd we will have Al Frazier from Texas joining Craig.  Gotta come see them, as they create a dynamic duo!!
 REMEMBER September begins our regular dance schedule: 2nd Friday, 4th Saturday.  Plus: 7pm - 8pm, Mainstream with rounds: 8 - 10pm.  Our website www.r-square-d.info is a great way to keep track of our club and events.
 Our Lessons will start on September 17th and will finish on November 7th.  They will be a little different this fall; twice a week on Monday and Wednesday evenings. Plus starts at 6:30 and a combined basic/mainstream class from 7:30 to 9:00.  Craig Abercrombie will again be teaching us the moves.
