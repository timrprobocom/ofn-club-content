We are having dances only in January & July for now. We will give this a trial and see what happens. Since our caller, Phil Ramey, has completed a "Caller School" and has some pretty good sounding ideas, the Rogue Squares are going to stick around and see how the situation is after January and the annual "Pajamarama."

In the meantime, we are dancing at the other clubs in our Council. We will be going to the Circle N Square's Birthday Dance on September 15, the Potato Festival in Klamath Falls the middle of October and Harvest Hoedown in Yuba City the end of October. The list goes on & on.

Our July 20 dance was "Potluck Birthday Party for the United States." The caller was Phil Ramey and the cuer was Elaine Funk. This dance was for any dancer who likes a good time and for the recent graduates (both September and January classes).  Everyone seemed to have a great time and we all ate too much.  This is typical of potlucks because, it seems, all square dancers are good cooks.

We are still working on the future for the Rogue Squares. Come on out and help us make a comeback.  You won't be sorry.

See you in a square!!
