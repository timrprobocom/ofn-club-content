The Wave Steppers’ Anniversary Dance will be Saturday, September 8th at Garibaldi City Hall.  The club, under various names; the Skippers, Coast Swingers, and most recently the Wave Steppers has been in business since sometime before 1900.  We’ve danced on the Dance Floor at Garibaldi’s City Hall since the building was built in 1948.  The Anniversary Dance will again be an Elvis Dance, with caller Mark Wheeler as Elvis and round dancing with cuer Connie Clark.  
 The last dance of the 2018 season, a “Fall Dance” Saturday, October 13th, will again have club caller Joe Wrabek and line dancing with Gwen Kiel.  After that, the club will be dark for the winter, except for classes and the annual Christmas party.
 The Wave Steppers’ dances are held at Garibaldi City Hall, 107 Sixth Street (just a block off US 101, 9 miles north of Tillamook).  About two-thirds of the second floor of City Hall is a dance floor, built in the 1940s for the old Firemen’s Balls.
 The club’s free square dance classes taught by club caller Joe Wrabek continue on Wednesdays, 5:30 to 7 p.m. at the Tillamook Elks Lodge, 1907 Third St. in downtown Tillamook.
