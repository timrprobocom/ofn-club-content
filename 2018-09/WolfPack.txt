Wolf Pack has been dancing all summer; the dances have been small but always fun.

At our recent meeting we came up with some fun themes dances for the next few months.  Our first dance on Sept 1st is cancelled due to Labor Day weekend.  October 6th we will be having a Spaghetti dinner before the dance and the 27th of October will be our Halloween dance.  Look for flyers in your monthly OFN.

1st and 4th Saturdays come out and have a "Howling" good time with the Pack.
