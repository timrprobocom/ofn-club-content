Even though we were dark in July and August, our preplanned four summer visitations to other clubs had great Tri Squares turnouts.  We visited Valley Squares, Bachelor ‘N Bachelorettes, Sunset Promenaders, and as I write this, we’ll visit the Hoedowners at the end of August.  We were so thankful for all their air conditioning!  Ten of us also visited Valley River’s annual “Dancing Under the Stars” with its own air conditioning provided by Mother Nature. 
 In September please mark your calendar to attend our “20th Anniversary Celebrate Good Times” dance, on Friday the 28th.  It should be lots of fun with National Caller Adam Christman joining us!
 Also on Sunday afternoons, starting September 23rd  we begin our lessons:  Waltz at 2:00 and Mainstream/B-51 at 3:30 at the Tigard Grange.  Please join us!
