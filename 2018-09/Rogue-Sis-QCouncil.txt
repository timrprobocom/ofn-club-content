Hi Everyone,
President, Lorri McIntosh, announced this council will be raffling a "Game Basket" to benefit the next "Young at Heart" Dance. This dance will be next July. Exact date and place is yet to be determined. If you have any games or puzzles to donate to this basket, please let Lorri or Lois know. All proceeds will go the the "Young at Heart" or Youth Dance.

Callers & Cuers delegate, Elaine Funk, gave us the dates and locations for the Rogue Valley Caller and Cuer Dances for the coming year.  They are as follows:
February 10, 2019 - Winterfest in Grants Pass
April 28, 2019 - Sunday Sundae Social in Medford
August 4, 2019 - Hot August Hoedown in Medford
December 15, 2019 - Midway Dance in Grants Pass

Don't forget, we have changed our meeting location. We are now at Round Table Pizza in Poplar Square.

PLEASE support the Council and the Clubs in the Rogue Valley. Everyone needs all the support they can get. Times are "skinny," so, please come out and help by supporting your local clubs. We don't want to lose any clubs because of non-support from the dancers.

The next Council meeting will be October 2, 2018 at Round Table Pizza in Poplar Square at 4:30pm.

Lois & Lorri
