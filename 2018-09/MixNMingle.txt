Summer is nearly over, and our lessons have concluded.  We have enjoyed meeting new friends and greeting those we've known longer.  Our schedule will be back to 3-5 level pre rounds at 7:30, and dance from 8:00 to 10:30.
 We will be dark September 1st and back to our regular dance nights starting September 15th.  
 Our 34th Birthday Dance will be October 20th and will feature Mainstream with every third tip Plus.  Come join us for a fun evening.  It's the perfect night to 
pick up a signature for your ambassador badge.  
 Our website (mixandminglesquares.org) experienced a slight problem awhile ago, but it is up and running again.  We appreciate everyoneâ€™s patience as we continue to work out its kinks and build it to its former self.
