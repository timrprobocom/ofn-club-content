Excitement abounds in the coming months for the Toe's and all our guests.
 September 5th our square dance lessons will begin at 7:00pm. All beginners are welcome.
 September 7th is a regular dance, Bev Flint will be cueing the pre-rounds at 7:30, & KC Curtis calling at 8:00.
 September 8th the Toe's are traveling to Garibaldi for a visitation to the Wave Steppers.
 September 21st, please come celebrate with us, as this will be our 43rd 'Berry Good Anniversary Dance', with many delicious berry desserts!
 Looking a little farther ahead, please mark your calendars now for October 7th, as you won't want to miss our annual Pink Dance.  As always we will have some fantastic Baskets to raffle off, and of course all the proceeds will go to cancer research.
 Until next time, DANCE ON!
