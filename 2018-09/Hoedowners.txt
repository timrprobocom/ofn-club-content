July was a barn burner this year; ♫“Hot, Hot, Hot”.  Even the weatherman kept repeating we were having a ♫“Heat Wave”.  On the 14th we held our Hawaiian Luau dance and it might have felt like ♫“The Heat is On” but actually the Aloha Grange’s air conditioning kept the dance floor cool like a♫ “Summer Breeze”  The Hoedowners were celebrating ♫“Islands in the Stream” with exotic flowers, leis and Hawaiian music. I think we succeeded.  Dancers came in their best tropical apparel, short pants and we dined on Luau food to offset the sizzling heat.  At least we weren’t trying to figure out where to go ♫“When the Volcano Blow”
 On the 28th we totally shifted gears to go cruising on a hot summer night.  Why?  We wanted a Root Beer Float Dance and ♫”Those Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer”.  We knew it was ♫“Too Hot” for hot hash and although we consider square dancing to be ♫“Hot Stuff”, we worried not everyone would enjoy ♫“Hot Fun in the Summertime” so an ice cream beverage seemed in order. What better way to end the evening than with foamy, creamy root beer floats, a little bit of ♫“Hot N Cold”, a little bit of ♫“Summertime Blues”.   What does September hold for the Hoedowners?  We’ll be tipping our hats to kids, parents and teachers with our September 8th Back to School Dance and Sock Hop.  Please bring school supplies to donate.
 On September 12th, we’ll start Mainstream lessons, 7pm at the Aloha Grange.  Daryl Clendenin will be teaching.  It’s a great time to bring your friends to learn this fabulous activity and for experienced dancers to brush up on those square dance skills.  It’s $6 at the door.  Experienced Angels welcome.
 September 27th is our Farmer’s Market Dance because September is prime season for all those fresh, organic treats from the garden or market; corn, tomatoes, melons, onions, beets, beans, potatoes, etc.  We’ll bring the fruits and veggies.
