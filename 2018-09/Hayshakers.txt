The Hayshakers are having their annual picnic the first Saturday in September.  We will be having a meeting to decide where our club wants to go.  It will be at Dale & Kathy Worthington’s unless the weather is bad and then we will go to the Grange.  Don’t forget the Seaside Sashay, October 26th and 27th.  Hope to see you there.  Call if there are any questions, Sylvia 503-325-8109 or Joyce Clark 503-647-5742.
