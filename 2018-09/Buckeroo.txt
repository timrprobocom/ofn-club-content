Wow, what a month! The Buckeroos enjoyed five evenings of dancing at the Douglas County Fair. We had a different caller each evening and enjoyed each and every one of them! We are so thankful that the Umpqua Area Council sponsors this event each year. We are already excited about doing it again next summer!
We are going to be doing a demo dance at the Pioneer Days on August 23rd. This is a fun family event, so if are in the area, plan to spend the day in Canyonville. The event is held at Pioneer Park August 23-25, 2018. We will also have our annual Buckeroo picnic that weekend. It is always fun to gather as a club and celebrate our love of dancing.
Mark your calendar for our 2nd Annual Back To School Barn Sale! The barn will be filled with treasures August 31st and September 1st. This will be the place to be if you have a dorm room to furnish this fall! Check the website for more info.
We are all excited to begin new mainstream lessons on September 9th. If you know anyone in the area who may be interested, please send them our direction!

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
