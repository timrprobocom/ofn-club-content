Oh, my goodness, you ladies should at least come to our dances to see our new ladies room President Glenn has built for us.  It even has a door now!  Bouncer Bruce Bruiser no longer has to stand outside to protect our maiden modesty!  It’s a right pretty room.  Well, it doesn’t have the hot tub and sauna that the guys claim they have, but it’s a right pretty room – one of the finest amongst the granges.

September is still the season for hot weather.  Don’t forget: we cancel our dances if the temp is 90 or higher.

Square lessons start the first Wednesday in September, an hour before our usual dance.  So far, we’re the only club between Oregon City and Canby to offer lessons.
