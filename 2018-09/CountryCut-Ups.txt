Back to school for some, back to lessons for square dancers! Our Mainstream lessons will begin September 13th with Scott Zinser every Thursday night from 7:30 to 9:30 PM. We will also have a Round Dance Two-Step class starting on September 9th with Tami Helms and Tim Keck, meeting at 7:00 to 8:30 PM on Sundays.  Sign up soon!

We have certainly had a hot summer and our new outdoor dance floor has been such a blessing. So far, we have not had to cancel any dances due to the heat. It is located in a shady area behind the Barn and the outdoor breezes cool us off.  Come join us if it is too hot to dance in your area!

We are gearing up for the annual Ham, Egg, and Pancake Breakfast and Bazaar. There are already raffle tickets available for three items: some hardwood firewood, a beautifully embroidered tablecloth, and a nightâ€™s stay at the Clackamas River House Bed and Breakfast. Take a chance and help us raise funds for the maintenance of the barn. 

Keep on dancing!
