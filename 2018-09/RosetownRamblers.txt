Most of the Ramblers enjoyed a 4th of July sojourn in Seattle for the 35th Annual IAGSDC Convention. Over the course of three days, your correspondent logged 100,000 steps on his personal fitness tracker. Now, that’s some floor time! We all had a wonderful time meeting dancers from all over North America, as well as Taiwan, Japan, Denmark, and Germany. Next year in Philadelphia!

Three of the most popular callers from the Seattle convention, Gary Monday, Kris Jensen, and Mike Kellogg, will be bound for Portland for our annual three-day square dance festival October 26-28. We call our festival Scares and Squares, due to its proximity to Halloween, and we will have a costume contest on Saturday night. Attire is casual for the entire weekend—you can wear your square dance finery if you wish, but anything goes with the Ramblers. We also welcome solo dancers for this weekend—there’s no need to bring a dance partner. Our callers are among the best in the entire country, so this is a great 
opportunity to have a convention-like dance experience without incurring travel costs! Find out more on our webpage: http://www.rosetownramblers.com/scares-n-squares/.

The Ramblers will be holding fall lessons at our new venue, starting Wednesday, September 26. The new venue is the Bridgeport UCC, 621 NE 76th Ave., Portland. Lessons run from 7-8:30. We will have two free introductions to square dancing at the same venue on August 29 and September 12, also from 7-8:30. All are welcome to the free introductions, where we will provide information about our lessons. As always with the Ramblers: no dance partner necessary and casual dress encouraged!

Finally, after our summer hiatus, our Second Saturday dances will resume on September 8 at the Milwaukie Grange. Ian Craig will be calling. We alternate Mainstream and Plus tips from 7:30 to 9:30. All are welcome to join us for a potluck at 6:30.

SYIAS!
