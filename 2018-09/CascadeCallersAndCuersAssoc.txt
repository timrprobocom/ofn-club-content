Our next scheduled dance is September 29 at the hall in Springfield.  7:30 Pre-Rounds and 8:00 - 10:00 Square dance.  Our callers and cuers will be doing the dance for you.  Please come and join us for an evening of FUN!

The callers and cuers have a meeting at 6:30. 

Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli will be calling and cueing a New Year's Eve dance at the Emerald Square Dance Center once again this year.  There will be more details next month.  Any callers or cuers present New Year Eve will be asked if they'd like to call and;/or cue.  Sounds like a fun way to bring in 2019!

Keep on dancing, calling and cueing for FUN
