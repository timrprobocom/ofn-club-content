Our next Council event will be a Tri Council dance hosted by the Portland Area Council.  The dance will be held at the Oak Grove Community Center, 14496 SE Cedar Avenue 97267 on the fifth Saturday in September, the 29th from 7PM to 11PM.  Stephen Cole will be the featured caller with Ken Pratt cueing the rounds.
  The TVC encourages all dancers to attend the anniversary dances of member clubs.  There are three anniversary dances in September: Wavesteppers start the month out on the 8th with their anniversary dance featuring Elvis (Mark Wheeler) at the Garibaldi City Hall, with Connie Clark cueing; the Toe Draggers will hold their Berry Good 43rd Anniversary Dance at the Kinton Grange on the 21st, KC Curtis calling and Bev Flint cueing; and the Tri Squares have their 20th Anniversary dance at the Tigard Grange on the 28th with national caller Adam Christman and Sandra Pinion cueing.
