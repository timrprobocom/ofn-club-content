The club continues in August with intro to Phase 3 for the Phase 2 dancers who are interested in moving up in difficulty of dancing. Our sessions have been pretty well attended and the Phase 3-4 always has room for more.
Now that September is almost upon us, we have had a meeting and come up with a new schedule for the fall. September 6 will be a party night to get ready for the new dance season. September 13 will see a change in our sessions as follows:
6:30 to 7:15    Intro to Phase 3 Cha
7:15 to 7:45    Workshop on Phase 2 and 3 to keep current
7:45 to 8:30    Phase 3-4 teach for West Coast Swing
8:30 to 9:30    Phase 4+ to Easy 5 workshops for the difficult steps
We are hoping that by offering the Intro to Cha, the Phase 2 dancers will attend our sessions and be comfortable with the move up to another level. We will have flyers out and will be doing word of mouth to get the word out to the dancers who need more than the easy level of dancing. 
Stephanie and Leonard continue to build up their teaching skills in round dancing and are making good progress. Come and support them in their endeavors to make our hobby more fun and entertaining. See you soon in our circle of friends and dancers. Marilyn Schmit
