There’s so many changes to our dances in September, paramountly the new outdoor floor at the Country Cut-Ups and the totally new venue at the Happy Hoppers.  They are now at the Washington Grange in Vancouver – one of the nicest (and newest) granges you will find anywhere.  Although the grange claims to be on 7701 NE Ward Rd. in Vancouver, you can only find the entrance on NE 77th.
