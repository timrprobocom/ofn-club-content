Such a Summer! Good thing we have air conditioning at the Aloha Grange.
 Our July 7th dance we had an official visitation from Tri-Squares, they retrieved their banner.  At the July 21st dance, the Columbia River Dancers had an official visitation and they retrieved their banner.  We had such a good time with both clubs.  As our clubs get smaller, visitations give us such a boost of fun and friendship. Keep dancing, it is so good for you.
 Our Summer/Fall classes are continuing. We did have to go dark in July for a class, temperature at my place (two miles from the grange) was 98 degrees, way too hot even with air conditioning.
 End of Summer is almost here, let's hope Fall is cooler.  Valley Squares September 1st dance “Back to School” we will be collecting school supplies, Scott Zinser is calling.  September 15th dance theme is “Jailhouse Rock”, with Craig Abercrombie calling.  Come rock with us.
 Connie Clark begins Cha Cha lessons on Tuesday's, September 18, 4:30 pm and Two-Step lessons, 5 pm.
