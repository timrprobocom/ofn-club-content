The IWW dance hall was dark in August, but it was still a busy month. We did a demo dance at the Steam Up in Brooks on the 4th. Many IWW dancers enjoyed the hospitality of our sister clubs at their dances and appreciated the opportunity to keep dancing during our dark month. Most club members helped with admission and car parking at the Polk County Fair, our annual fund raiser. The Fair’s new computerized ticket sale procedure using hand held I-Pods and ticket printers made for an interesting transition. 
We will celebrate the end of another great summer at our annual IWW Picnic at Maud Williamson State Park on August 26.

Fall mainstream lessons will be in Building D at Salem Hospital (Rooms D2-1 and D2-2; use Visitor Parking [free]), Sundays 6-8 pm beginning September 16. Lessons are free.  Registration ends September 30. See the OFN for details.  

Our kick-off dance of the new dance year is September 1. Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays at Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall. Don’t miss our upcoming special dances: November 3 Halloween Dance; December 8 Christmas Dance; March 9 IWW Birthday Dance; April 13 Easter dance.  Hope to see you across a square!
