As September comes we hope the really hot weather is finally behind us.  We are sorry that the Grange has no air conditioning but with the new windows that open so nicely and the breeze that comes in the evening we are gearing up for a dance in September.
 Yup, that is right. Only one dance this month unless you are into clogging.  The area clogging club rents the Hazel Dell Grange ever fourth Saturday in September.  So, look for the Dancers to come visiting.  We will decide soon and let the lucky club get out the banner they got from us and perhaps even get out their banner as we will attempt to take it home.
 The dance we will have will be great, however.  On the 8th, Dan Nordbye will be calling and Julie Stiers will be cueing.  As we do every year, we will gladly take any school supplies that are brought and make sure they get to children who could truly use them.
 If you are not on our list of Friends of the Columbia River Dancers, drop me an email at nickandjan@comcast.net with your email and I will make sure you get our emails.  It is really nice to be able to see when the weather is such that we are not dancing or having lessons as was the case a few times this summer.
 We look forward to having you visit.  Remember that it is our honor to make sure that everyone gets to dance.  This means that if you are a single, please feel welcome to come.
