Is summer over?  Seasons come and go so quickly these days.  It seems like yesterday I was putting seeds into the ground.  We should take the advice of the poet, Robert Herrick (1591-1674)  “Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old Time is still a flying: And this same flower that smiles today, Tomorrow will be dying…..”  
 Note location change:  Join us at the Aloha Grange for a special Labor Day Dance, September 3rd.  Sunset Presbyterian Church is closed that day.  Aloha Grange is located on 185th Avenue and 1/2 block North of TV Highway.
 July’s hot weather has not been a problem for the Eager Beavers since the Sunset Presbyterian Church is air conditioned.  Do come join us for some cool dancing.  To keep our thoughts cool we had a Christmas in July dance.  Everyone who wore a little red and green posed for an out-of-season photograph.  
 Even if you work on Mondays, you can join us once in a while; we dance every Monday, even on holidays except Christmas and New Years.  Our three great callers (Jim Hattrick, Daryl Clendenin, and Darrell Kalmbach) keep us on our toes as each week, always seeming to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  We dance from 1:00 to 3:00 pm at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
