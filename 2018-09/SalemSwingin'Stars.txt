We have been dancing the nights away, even in the heat. Our July dances were well attended. Our third Friday dance had six, count them, SIX squares on the floor.  It was an awesome dance with visitors from Vancouver, Portland, Beaverton, Lebanon, Corvallis and Silverton and, of course, Salem. Thanks to all who came.
Hot August nights went well. Willamette Squares visited us on our first Friday dance. We will have three dances in the month, ending with our 5th Friday Plus Dance on August 31.
