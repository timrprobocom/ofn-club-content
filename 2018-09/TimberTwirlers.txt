Timber Twirlers have been dark for the summer but we start back up on September 21 with our casual Welcome Back dance and our mainstream lessons will start on the 25th.
 
Of course our World Famous PIRATE dance will be October 5. If you haven't been before, you have missed a great time. Costumes are strongly encouraged.
 
We dance the first and third Fridays of the month so come and join us as we would love to have you. Sandy
