Greetings from the Buzzin'  Bees. We hope your summer was good and we hope you are as excited to start the dance season as we are. Our first dance is on Saturday, September 15th. It will start with Pre Plus Workshop at 7 p.m. and mainstream at 7:30. Our theme is "Welcome back" as in "Welcome Back Kotter" - 70's themed. We will feature root beer floats at the break. K.C.Curtis is our caller and Lonnie Sykes is our cuer. We dance at the Hazel Dell Grange.

Our lessons start on September 9th at 6 p.m. at the Hazel Dell Grange. We also will be adding in plus lessons that start on October 14th. We'll be welcoming back some of our favorite themes this year such as the pie eating contest, the pajama dance and our backlight dance.

The Bees send our heartfelt thanks to Dorothy Lowder for her service as one of our cuers this past year. It was her second go-round with the Bees. Many of us learned to round dance from Dorothy. She has decided to retire for health reasons. Dorothy - we will miss you and thank you so much for the many years you have given us.

Lonnie Sykes has been our cuer for the third Saturday dance and he will pick up a few more dances and we will have guest cuers as well. We hope to see you in a Square.  

Debbie Broers
