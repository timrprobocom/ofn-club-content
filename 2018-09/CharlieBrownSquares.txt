The Charlie's were dark in August for the Fair; but we were still busy. We had a booth to give information about upcoming classes and hopefully that will help get some new dancers! Thank you to those that volunteered to man the booth!! Several Charlie's attended USA West Convention in Reno; and had a wonderful time!!!  

We are getting ready to start new classes on Thursday, September 6th. Please note the change in class day for our new Mainstream class.  Tuesdays from 630-8 will be a new Plus class followed by our Advanced by Tape class from 8-930. We would love to see dancers at these two classes. The Tuesday classes will start on September 11. 

September 4th we will have a Bust The Rust dance to shake off the cobwebs of our angels and get ready for new classes!! Please join us! Rikki Lobato will cue rounds and Chuck Simpkins will call. Dance starts at 6 with pre-rounds. Mainstream/Plus/Rounds from 630-9.

We all had a wonderful time celebrating Wayne Weaver's (and Debbi's) retirement!! What a special nite for all involved!!

We will be dark for Saturday nite dances during the month of September - due to Labor Day and the Circle N Square Birthday dance. 
We look forward to traveling to Yreka to attend this special dance.

Dances will start up again in October. Oct 6th we have Chuck Simpkins & Sarge Glidewell. Oct 20th we are visiting Klamath Falls to dance at the Potato Festival - watch for a sign up sheet for car pool etc.  November dances includes J Domis & Bob Dingman on the 3rd & Mike Sikorsky & Cathy Houston on the 17th.  Then plan for a fabulous celebration on December 1st for our 51st birthday dance with the wonderful Michael Kellogg and MaryAnn Callahan!!!  The year winds down with Phil Ramey & Elaine Funk on the 15th!  Lots of fun dances at our hall and many more throughout the valley and beyond that we look forward to attending!!

Happy Dancing & See You In A Square!
