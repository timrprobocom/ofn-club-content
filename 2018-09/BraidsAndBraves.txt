In July we enjoyed a Campout at Vernonia and danced a demo at Amity's Pancake Breakfast. 

August 18 we tried a Community Dance, hoping to introduce some new people to the fun of Square Dancing, at the McMinnville LDS Church from 1-4 pm. We had free food, too. We will report on the results of this dance in next monthâ€™s OFN.

Our lessons for new dancers will begin Sept. 9 and our new season of dances will begin on Sept. 15 at the Palmer Creek Lodge in Dayton. Carmen
