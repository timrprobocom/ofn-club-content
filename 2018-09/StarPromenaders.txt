There is such a delight in seeing the happy shine of people learning the joy and fun of Square Dancing.  There will also be A1/A2 Workshops on Wednesdays in September and Classes/Workshops start in October. Watch for Wayne's E-Mail...

Sorry I missed you all last month.....just didn't seem to get it all together.

Diamond Lake was a wonderful time.  We had some smoke problems a few days but as a general rule it was really nice weather.  Dancing in the Lake was cool and fun.  And dancing to Hunter Keller is always the tops.  Diamond Lake can only be successful due to the hard work of the Chairpersons Walt and Darlene Shontz and all those that work so well on the Committee.  I was going to list all those that helped this year.....but I fear omitting someone!  So THANK YOU, THANK YOU,  THANK YOU to all whose work made Diamond Lake Festival another grand success.  Dann and Fay Houghton will be Chairpersons for 2019.

Lois Muck has included a group of fliers in her newsletter and our newsletter for upcoming dances and events.

Back to School....Come on out and Call or Cue.....Bring clean stuffed animals for Medford Police Department....Come play Mexican Train......so many events.    Check all the fliers and mark your calendars and I am sure I will see you somewhere.

And maybe a special dance with Eric Henerlau is in the works!!!!   Keep an eye and an ear out!!

So bring someone to class......dress up for a dance.....come to our meeting......see you.

Remember that the September meeting is held on the first Thursday, instead of the 2nd Thursday,  to avoid chaos on the 1st night of class.
