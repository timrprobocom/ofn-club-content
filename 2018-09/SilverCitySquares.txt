We had great fun dancing to Leonard Snodgrass in the Silverton Homer Davenport Days Parade. We managed to get enough of our club members to have one square on the trailer plus a couple of "walkers" handing out flyers and two in the truck pulling the trailer.

Lessons are starting this month and we are hoping for a good turnout this year.

We are back to dancing this month! Join us for our Hawaiian pie night. We will have a variety of pies for our snack at break.

Karyn Buchheit should know sometime this month the location for next May's Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival. We do have the pins available now. See you at a dance soon. Petrina Buchheit
