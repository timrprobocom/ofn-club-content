<li><a>Resale Clothing at Mid-Winter</a>
<div>
<p>Here it is mid-summer 2018, but Mid-Winter Festival 2019 is fast approaching. &nbsp;For many of you it provides an opportunity to recycle a few of those outfits taking up space in your closets.&nbsp; For others, it is that sad time when you are saying, &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t dance anymore&rdquo;, and you want someone else to enjoy those beautiful outfits you have received so much pleasure wearing over the years.</p>
<p>As with so many activities it has become more and more difficult to find volunteers willing to help.&nbsp; Resale Clothing is one of those areas that require a large number of volunteers to make it an available resource for all the dancers.&nbsp; So, we have been making some changes to this area.</p>
<p>But first let&rsquo;s look closely at some key tips to assist you selling your clothing items at Mid-Winter Festival 2019.</p>
<p>Follow the on-line instructions and email or mail your list of items in by January 16, 2019.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; If you are having any problems completing the form on line, then by all means hand write it &ndash; legibly and mail it in.&nbsp; We will input it for you.&nbsp; This will save you and us a lot of time at the consignment tables.&nbsp; Read the instructions very, very carefully.</p>
<p>Make sure the items are clean and in good repair.</p>
<p>Bring your items listed in categories to simplify the tagging process at the consignment tables.</p>
<p>If you have sets, then keep/place them together.&nbsp; This will help in the tagging process and may even help making them sell.</p>
<p>Please, be early to consignment.&nbsp; We have expanded the hours for you so plan on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning so they will be prominently placed on the racks for the opening sales Friday evening.</p>
<p>As I said earlier we require a large number of volunteers to assist during consignment and sale hours.&nbsp; We will accept any help, even if for just one (1) hour.&nbsp; So, contact the volunteer coordinator and let her know you want to help.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to pick up those items you want returned by 10:00 a.m. on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>I made mention several times about the difficulty in finding volunteers to help keep the Resale Clothing program running.&nbsp; So, beginning last year, Mid-Winter Festival 2018 we are no longer accepting clothing items at the festival that were not listed for consignment before the input deadline.</p>
<p>We are sorry it has come to this.&nbsp; But we hope you will utilize the on-line submission process or hand write it &ndash; again legibly, and send it to us.&nbsp; You will be surprised at how much time this saves you and those at the consignment table.&nbsp; We want to help you recycle the many beautiful outfits that you all have.</p>
<p>Contact me for assistance preferably by email.&nbsp; Larry B. Reetz at <a href="mailto:larryreetz@gmail.com">larryreetz@gmail.com</a> or if you must call my home phone at 541-461-5642.</p>
