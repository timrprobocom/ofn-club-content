We danced on July 12 and July 26.  We did not go dark for Diamond Lake as we have in the past.  Both of our dances were fun with Jim Hattrick calling the first and Lennie Ludiker calling the second one and Jackie Gale cueing at both. Our 2nd Friday dance had a theme—Crazy T-Shirt and Watermelon Dance.  We had quite a few crazy T-shirts on the floor.  We all enjoy being able to dress casually during these hot summer months.  Even with air-conditioning wearing square dance attire is just too hot!

In September we get our new dance year off to a great start with Jim Hattrick calling the 2nd Friday and Dan Nordbye the 4th Friday.  Jackie Gale will be cueing both our dances. In September we will start our new dance format: 7:30 plus, 8-10:00PM mainstream wit no formal break.  Open grazing will be allowed after 8PM and announcements and split the pot will be done at 10PM.  We will also start charging $6.00 per person at the door.  This will be in keeping with our neighbors to the north and to help offset our lower income.   Our Sept. 13th dance will have a theme—Sock Hop!—so if you would like to wear your 50’s outfits including but not limited to white over-sized shirts or skinny white T-shirts and jeans, poodle skirts and saddle shoes or loafers, please do so.

Please come join us.  We always have a great time square and round dancing and welcoming new people as well as old friends.

On a side note the clubs here in the Eugene-Springfield area will be supporting the efforts of Roger Putzler to teach new dancers the mainstream calls here at the Emerald Square Dance Center starting Tuesday, October 1st from 7PM to 8:30PM.  He plans to have a plus class immediately following the mainstream class.  Angels and new dancers pay $5.00 for one class or both per night.  Please invite anyone interested to come join these lessons and learn from a great teacher.
