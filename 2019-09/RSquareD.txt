 R Square D has had wonderful Summer dances.  We have been pleased with our air conditioning, having mostly 4 squares on the floor, it helps to keep all those bodies cool.  As Craig played on summer vacation, we enjoyed Jim Raupp calling and the Cougar Squares attending our second July dance.  We invited Jim, Paula, and the Cougars to join the R Square D at the Chinese Gardens for dinner before the dance.  We filled the back room they have for groups.  Isn't that like the gatherings of the "old days"?  We were lucky everyone was still able to dance (or perhaps needed to) after such a loaded spread of food.
 It has been such a fun dance summer!  But, with the long days drawing to a close we go back to regular dance days for September.  REMEMBER, Second Friday, Fourth Saturday.  Wait a minute!  I don't mean that the fun dancing stops, oh no, just different days.
 As you are planning ahead please make sure our Octoberfest weekend is on your calendar, October 11th and 12th at Rose Valley Grange.  A rocking good time with Adam Christman and Craig Ambercrombie.  Please see the flyer for all the particulars.
 Our schedule is: 7pm - 8pm Plus with advanced rounds, 8pm - 9:30pm Mainstream with rounds. Location: 106 NW 8th Ave, Kelso, WA 98626 by the Rotary spray park at the intersection of Hwy 4 and W Main, Kelso/Longview.  Our dances are $6 donation.
 See you in a square,
