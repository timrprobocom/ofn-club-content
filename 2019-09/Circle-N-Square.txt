Our county fair is now over. Our "Pepsi Booth" was staffed and another year is on the books. A big thank you to all of the volunteers who braved the heat, wind, rain, lightning, and power outages. Thank you to Phillip and Roberta for coming down and donating their time in the booth.  


We took a short break after the fair from our Square Dance 101 class but will resume next week. We currently have two squares and hope to increase that number when we open up to new dancers on Sept. 9, & 16. The wheels keep turning in preparation for our Birthday dance Sept 21. I know it will be lots of fun. As always, we want to invite everyone to come out and dance. With the conflict of another dance being held at the RVSDC with three national callers, I personally hope dancers will support our club as we are part of the Rogue Siskiyou council, and support it whenever possible. I understand wanting to dance to the "Top Dogs" but I certainly view Eric as a "Top Dog". As a reminder, we have another special necklace that we are raffling off, we also have a few other special custom door prizes for attendees. Look for fliers for more info.

Hope to see you on the floor!
