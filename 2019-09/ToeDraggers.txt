The Toe Draggers have had a busy and fun summer.  Our summer camp-out was at Vernonia City Park, where one of our prominent couples had a shot gun wedding! (with deacon brother KC officiating!) What a Hoot!
 August 2nd, we had 2 ½ squares in attendance for our Beach Blanket Bingo dance, and we even played a game of bingo at break. 
 Well it’s that time… This year our square dance lessons will take place 2 days a week.  Starting Wednesday September 18th from 7:00-9:00pm, and then again on Saturday September 21st from 10:00-12:00 noon.  We plan on giving this schedule a trial run for 2-3 weeks and then reevaluate our progress.
 September 20th the Toe’s will be celebrating 44yrs together!
 Please come visit us soon, we miss You!
