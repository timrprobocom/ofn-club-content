Even though Tri Squares were dark in July and August, our preplanned four summer visitations to other clubs went very well and kept us dancing.  We visited the Bachelor ‘N Bachelorettes, Valley River’s “Under the Stars” Dance, Sunset Promenaders, and as I write this, we’ll visit the Hoedowners at the end of August.  We are so thankful for all their air conditioning, some provided by Mother Nature. 
 In September please mark your calendar to attend our 21st anniversary dance, "Celebrate Good Times!" on Friday the 27th.  It should be lots of fun with our cuer Sandra Pinion and special guest, national caller Adam Christman joining us!
 Also on Sunday afternoons starting September 22nd we begin our lessons:  Two-Step at 2:00 with Sandra Pinion, and Mainstream-B51 at 3:30 with Terry Halley, at the Tigard Grange.  Please join us!
