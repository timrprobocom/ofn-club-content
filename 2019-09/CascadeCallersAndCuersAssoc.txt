Our meetings and dances are held on the fifth Saturdays which is about 4 times a year.  We will NOT be having a dance August 31 as that is Labor Day weekend.  We wish everyone a safe Labor Day and look forward to classes with new folks.

Our last dance was June 29, and I wish to thank Cherie and Pat Cox for  presiding over the meeting, taking ,minutes and calling and cueing along with other CCCA members present. I was able to attend Sydnee Preedy's wedding outside of Everett, Washington that same day.  Sydnee's dad is the national caller, Dan Preedy. 

Our next scheduled dance will be November 30 at the dance center in Springfield.  The floor in our hall is cushioned and so nice to dance on.  We also have new ElectroVoice speakers purchased from Dan Nordbye.  The speakers work well.

Keep on calling and cueing for fun,
Christina Corelli
