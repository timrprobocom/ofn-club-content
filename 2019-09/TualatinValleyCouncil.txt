The Oregon Federation has certified a new club to our Council, the Oak Hills Squares.  They dance at the Oak Hills Recreation Center with club caller Lane Clem.  See report below.  The TVC now boasts 14 member square dance clubs, the largest Council in the State!
 Since the OFN is published mid month, you may still have time to attend the TVC  fifth Saturday Dance, held at the Aloha Grange on August 31st. This dance will feature Daryl Clendenin calling with Connie Clark cueing.  The dance begins with pre-rounds at 7:30 followed by Mainstream with rounds at 8:00.  Every third tip will be Plus.  This dance is co-hosted by the Valley Squares.
