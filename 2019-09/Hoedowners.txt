"Summer afternoon; to me those have always been the two most beautiful words in the English language” Henry James.  Those words were a total inspiration for the Hoedowners in July this year.  On July 13th we held our Hawaiian Luau dance with Daryl Clendenin on the mic calling and Julie Stiers cueing.  We also had Dan Nordbye take the stage as a guest caller.  The Sunset Promenaders were out in force with almost two squares.
 Then on the 27th we held our annual Root Beer Float Dance.  They tasted as cool and refreshing as all those soda fountain floats of our youths.  We were all charmed when Melissa James called a tip. We hope to hear more from her. The Columbia River Dancers claimed a banner while seven other clubs had members who joined us.
 On July 30th we joined the boys of summer when we attended our annual Hoedowner Hops baseball game.  Which do we enjoy more; the sound of a baseball meeting a bat or the great buffet the Hops serve?  We rooted for the home team, who won, we sang Take Me Out to the Ballgame during the 7th inning stretch and took lots of pictures with Barley the Hop’s mascot.  It was the quintessential, All American, evening.
 So what lies ahead?  On September 10th we begin our fall mainstream lessons; 7 pm, at the Aloha Grange.
 On September 14th we’ll have our Farmer’s Market Dance and on September 28th our Caller’s Choice Dance.  Please join us.
