Cherry City Cloggers have had a wonderful Demo season with dancing at World Beat, The Salem Art Fair, Marion County Fair, Silverton Art Festival and The State Fair.  After wrapping up a successful demo season, we will move into starting our beginner lessons which will begin on September 10 at 5:45 p.m.  Those wishing to participate could come as early as 5:30 to complete the registration process and purchase taps for his/her shoes. The class is open to anyone 8 years and up who have a desire to learn clog dancing and have a fun time every Tuesday evening. Children do need to be accompanied by a parent. Pre-registration fee will be $50 per person for the class that will end just before Christmas. Registration if paid at the door will be $60.
