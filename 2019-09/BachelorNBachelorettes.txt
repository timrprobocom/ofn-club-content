For all those keeping track, Darrell Kalmbach’s birthday was on our August 7 dance, when he was calling for our club.  Keep that in mind for next year.  The River City Dancers also paid us a visitation that night.  (They are big on supporting their club caller and cuer.)

Our BIGGEST offering (in a long time) is our Picnic and Dance, Sept 15th .  (See flyer in “Special Dances”).  This is an inter-club picnic and dance.  It’s billed as being at the Trails End Park in Oregon City; however, the Oregon City Parks Department assures me there is no such park.  The proper name is the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center at 1726 Washington St., in Oregon City.  Keep this in mind if asking the locals for directions or locating on a map.  Or, just ask the locals where the big covered wagons are.  Also, note this is a PICNIC, not the usual potluck.  Whatever food you bring is all yours.  Don’t forget your drinks, tables, seating and comfy shoes, as you will be eating and dancing on grass (unless we move to the covered area).

To be honest, this event is going to be the type where we have no idea of who might come, or clubs that will be represented.  One thing we do know is that this picnic venue is going to cost the club a bundle!  Donations will happily be accepted to defray costs.  As of this moment, the dancing will be squares only, and Scott Zinser will be donating his time.  There is the possibility of some rounds.
