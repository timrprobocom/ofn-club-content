Despite one night of rain we had four other nights of great dancing at the center stage at the Douglas County Fair.  Congratulations to the most recent folks elected to the board of the Umpqua Area Council. A special thank you needs to go out to these folks for stepping up and volunteering to run for an office and serve as a Board Member.  They will begin their terms September 1st. 
The following folks were elected: 
Lois Muck, President
Carmen Dowsett, Vice President
David Harman, Secretary
Carolyn Skinner, Treasurer
Gabriel Smith was appointed to be the UAC delegate.

Thanks to these dedicated club members and others who volunteer to serve in ways that help their Clubs and Council.
