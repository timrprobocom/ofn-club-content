The heat has not slowed us down here at the Buckeroo Barn! Our new cooling system has been put it to use this summer! 

Our first dance of the month was our  Annual Ladies Night Out Dance. We had Janienne Alexander down from Tualatin to call for us, and Rickie Labato cued for the round dancers. We had a large turnout and everyone had a great time!  

We also danced at the Douglas County Fair this month. Douglas County Fair allows us to hold dances every night at the fair. Past members of the Buckeroo Barn have built a nice wooden dance floor that we continue to use. We are part of the entertainment so we are asked to wear square dance attire, but it is structured as a dance not an exhibition. It is so much fun to dance under the stars and be part of such a fun community event. We are very happy that the Umpqua Area Council continues to sponsor this event each year.

We had our Back to School Barn Sale in August. We do several fundraisers throughout the year to help us raise money for the upkeep of the barn. We had a large selection of great items, so if you need treasures watch for our next sale!

Rememberâ€¦ we are just a short drive south from the Portland area, so plan to join us in the near future. We dance the first and third Saturdays and always enjoy having visitors. We have members of all ages and are a family friendly club.

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
