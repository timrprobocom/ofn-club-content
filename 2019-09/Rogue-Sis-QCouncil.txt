The youth dance in July went well with Dean Black, from Yreka, calling at Fruitdale Grange in Grants Pass.  Several people showed up and had a great time dancing and enjoying some boiled peanuts that Lorri McIntosh brought back from Georgia after attending the National Square Dance Festival.
 
Raise the Roof for Beachcombers benefit dance went exceptionally well. Malcom, from Port Orford Beachcombers, came over in support of the dance to help put a new roof on the Beachcombers dance hall. Rogue Sis Q callers and cuers volunteered their time, the Star Promenaders donated the hall for the entire weekend, and big raffle baskets were available for dancers to buy tickets and win. We even had Grant Self, one of the men from Stars, bake a Granny Smith apple pie and a fresh blackberry pie, and each pie was raffled off to the highest bidder, kinda like they do in Port Orford. Dancing in sprinklers, instead of the surf at Battle Rock, felt refreshing with the hot August weather. Each dancer who danced in the sprinklers received a dangle for their efforts and support. The final hurrah for the weekend was Sunday morning breakfast with all you could eat pancakes, bacon and eggs. Many stayed after breakfast to play train, dominoes and rummicubes, waiting for the Rogue Valley Callers and Cuers Hot August Hoedown on Sunday afternoon. The new officers worked together to have a successful weekend. The councilâ€™s final accounting for the benefit dance? We sent $816.00 in funds collected from the Raise the roof weekend to Beachcombers to help with the new roof.
