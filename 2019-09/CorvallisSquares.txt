Our club is planning a potluck and meeting in August, to reconnect and gear up for the fall. We look forward to kicking off the dance season on Sept. 14! We decided our first dance of the year will be an introductory open-invitation dance. Charlotte Jeskey and Sandy Harris have agreed to call squares and line dances appropriate for all-comers. Feel free to invite folks! 

Our mainstream lessons will be on Thursday evenings, starting October 3, 7:30 - 9:00 p.m., through December 13. Weâ€™re once again offering lessons through Linn-Benton Community College, with Bruce Lowther as our wonderful instructor. We look forward to seeing you on the dance floor this fall! Karen
