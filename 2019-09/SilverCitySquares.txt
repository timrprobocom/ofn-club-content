We did the Homer Davenport Days parade the first Saturday in August. We had a few more dancers than we did in July, which made it easier to switch out when someone got tired. It also allowed us to hand out lesson flyers.

Thomas has been teaching lessons this summer with two students. We have usually had just enough angels to have one square. He should finish in time for regular lessons and then they can angel Leonard's class with us.

We will be back dancing in September! Watch for our dance flyer. Petrina Buchheit
