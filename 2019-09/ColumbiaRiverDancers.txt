The Columbia River Dancers, while being dark this summer, were very active.  We went hunting for those elusive banners we gave to clubs that we nice enough to visit us.  Not only did we get banners back we visited clubs and they gave us theirs.  
 Now as the weather gets cool enough to dance again at the Hazel Dell Grange we will help a school get started with our Back to School dance on September 14th.  We are encouraging dancers to bring some school supplies.  Renee Ruud will be our guest caller that evening.  Come join us for a great evening of fun.
 Just because we did not dance on a Saturday does not mean we gave up on lessons.  New dancers continued to learn at our Tuesday night lessons.  We start a new class on the first Monday of each month with Jim Hattrick as our instructor.  Beginners at 7 PM and mainstream about 8:30.
 The annual Cloggers get together will mean we will be DARK on the 28th. We probably will be heading out looking for another banner, so look for us that night.
