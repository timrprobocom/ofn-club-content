 Dance Under the Stars last month at the tennis courts as part of the Old Fashioned Festival was a fun evening with great weather.  The Newberg Old Fashioned Festival Queen’s Court made an appearance and Randy Dibble spread royalty around into several of the seven squares dancing so we could show the gals what we do.  There were some big smiles and everyone had a great time.  The next morning the Valley River Dancers dazzled the town’s people by dancing in the Festival parade to upbeat singing calls by Randy Dibble.  The parade theme was “Dancing in the Streets,” and that’s exactly what we did!
 A round dance workshop continues preceding our 2nd Friday dance, led by Ken and Dianne Pratt, beginning at 6:30 pm. Come work on your round dancing moves with us.  Scott Zinser will be guest calling the Plus dance.
 Our Mainstream September 27th dance will feature a black light, so come glow in the dark and have some Friday evening fun dancing with us.  Square dancers are invited to Abby's Pizza after the dance to enjoy complimentary sodas.
 Mainstream lessons begin Tuesday, September 3rd 6:30-8 p.m. at the Chehalem Community Center.  Cost is $68 for the 12-week course taught by Randy Dibble.  An ‘A’ workshop continues from 8-9:30 p.m. Cost $6.
