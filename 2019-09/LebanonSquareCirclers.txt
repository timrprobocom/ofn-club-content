After our wonderful Strawberry Festival, some of our club members attended the Pioneer Picnic in Brownsville.  Many of our members are taking fun vacations.  
We have some special dances on our regular dance night so our new dancers can keep dancing. Jim Voll is calling for these dances. We hope you are having a great summer! Marilyn York
