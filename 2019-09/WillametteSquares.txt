Willamette Squares has been enjoying its summer themed dances. We always enjoy our time together dancing, visiting, and sampling the delicious dishes every one brings to share. We hope to be able to offer square and round dance lessons in September. We wish everyone an enjoyable remainder of the summer as we dance our way toward fall!  Jodee Howard
