It is with great sadness that we report of the recent and sudden death of our dear member Bert Labedz. She is loved and sorely missed.

As we have mentioned in previous articles, our club does visitations to other clubs every month. We strongly believe this is how we support each other and bring more dancers to the dance floor. We now have a nice collection of banners from other clubs and recently have enjoyed having clubs visit us to retrieve their banners. At our first dance in July , we had 97 dancers. This was the result of having a visitation from Columbia River Dancers, B n B as well as guests from other clubs.  We have been informed that we are expecting two more clubs to visit us in August. If your club is not actively doing visitations, we encourage you to do so.

In August we visited Country Cut Ups and enjoyed dancing on their outdoor dance floor under the stars. Then the next week, we surprised our caller Darrell Kalmbach who was calling on his birthday at BNB with a SECRET surprise visitation. B n B knew we were coming and helped us keep it a secret .Thank you B nB  and Country Cut Ups for such great hospitality. 

On September 7 we will be having a visitation to Maplewood Grange  in Aurora to attend the State organizational meeting , dinner and dance on September 7. Then the next day, Sunday September 8, lessons for new and beginner dancers begin. That will be from 6-8 PM  at our hall ( Milwaukie Community Center) and we are offering the first 8 lessons free.  

We will also be having our usual two club dances each month on the second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community Center at 42nd and Jackson Street in Milwaukie. We love having visitors and everyone is welcome.
