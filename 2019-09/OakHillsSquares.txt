 Oak Hills Squares Club dances every Monday night at the Oak Hills Recreation Center on NW 153rd and NW Oak Hills Dr. from 6:30 to 8:30pm.  Dress is casual except on the first Monday of the month, when square dance attire is encouraged.  Lane Clem is our caller and cuer.  Our dances are currently at class level.  This class is scheduled to finish by mid-August, and a new class will begin on September 9th.  Then the schedule will be class from 6:30 to 7:30, and regular dance from 7:30 to 8:30.
 We are excited to have been accepted by the TVC, and by the Oregon Federation.
 We had a demo dance in the neighborhood as part of the festivities on the Fourth of July, dancing beside the pool.  We will also be doing a demo dance at the Cedar Mill Farmerâ€™s Market on September 14th from 9:30 to 10:30 am, in the Safeway parking lot at Murray Rd. and Cornell Rd.
 Come visit us any Monday night.
