Well, Diamond Lake Festival is in the records books. The weather was good and not too many mosquitoes, at least as long as there was a breeze blowing.

The next “Game Night” will be on September 13th. There was a lot going on in the months of July and August, so we postponed it until September. The theme will be “Sandwich Fixins.” Come out and join us. It is a “Hoot.”

The Stars “Club Picnic” will be on September 8th. Wayne & Debbi Weaver have extended an invitation to all for the use of their home for this event. Thank you, Wayne & Debbi!

Phil Ramey will start a new “Plus” class on Monday, September 9th from 6:30-8:30pm.

Classes are going to start on Thursday, September 12. Remember – The Frist 5 lessons are “Free.”
