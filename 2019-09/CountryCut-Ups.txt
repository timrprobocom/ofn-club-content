Back to school time means back to lessons for square dancers. Our mainstream lesson taught by Scott Zinser will start on September 12th and run from 7:30 to 9:30 PM every Thursday. But there are other learning opportunities at the Barn as well. Tami Helms will be teaching Cha Cha lessons starting September 8th on Thursday evenings from 7:00 to 8:30 PM. Lynn Wunische will continue to teach line dancing on Thursdays at 6: 00 to 7:00 PM, so you can make Thursdays a double header!

Donâ€™t forget to save the date for our annual Ham, Egg, and Pancake Breakfast and Bazaar! It is Sunday, October 20th from 8 AM to 1 PM. Not only will we have all you can eat for $6.00, but we have some pretty clever crafters. Do some early Christmas shopping at our bazaar. Maybe you will win a raffle, if you buy some tickets!
