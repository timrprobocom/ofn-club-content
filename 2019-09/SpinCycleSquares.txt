I am so sorry to let you know that we lost one of our dancers recently.  Joe Grivel and his husband, Fred Wilson, were long time dancers with Spin Cycle Squares.  Joe had bravely battled cancer for quite a while.  Joe had even come to take care of Kirby while Kirby was on hospice, and I had an appointment to attend.  Joe was caring, compassionate, kind and silently strong.  Our thoughts and hearts are with Fred.  Joe is missed by all of us.  He made a difference and our hearts are full with fond memories.

We dance almost every Sunday at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.  5:30 - 8:00.  We dance all levels.  Our caller, Tim Matteson, will adjust the levels according to who shows up to come and dance.  It's always FUN, and we always have a lot of FOOD!  We encourage all square dancers to join us!  The floor is cushioned and comfortable! We even have heat and air conditioning!

Please call Tim at 541-988-0399 or David at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are dancing.  We are dark once in a blue moon, but we'd hate to miss you. 

Keep on dancing,
Christina Corelli
