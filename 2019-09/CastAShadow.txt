We danced to Dan Nordbye in July, and some of us attended Summer Festival up in Salem Friday and Saturday for the advanced dancing being offered there.  We really enjoyed the session with Dan Nordbye and will be expecting to have him one more time September 8 1:30 TO 3:30pm before he heads back to Mesa for part of he winter.  We enjoy our recorded sessions as well but could not muster a square for the one scheduled in July.  We sure like seeing our friends from north of us come join us on the dance floor.  Itâ€™s a bit of a stretch we know for those in the Medford area to come.  But all are welcome.  Just be sure to check the website to be sure we are holding a dance on any given Sunday.  Also be aware we dance in Hall B behind the square dance center at 2095 Yolanda in Springfield.
