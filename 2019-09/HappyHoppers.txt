It’s been a great summer for Hoppers.  So far we have had two fun filled and well attended activities:  the Pizza Dance in July and the annual picnic in August. If you were at the Pizza Dance, you know that everyone enjoyed the pizza, visiting with friends, and a great dance. By the time this is published we all will have had one more chance to dance together at our second summer dance on August 17th.   The goal was to encourage our students to keep dancing through the summer, so the dances were primarily mainstream level. Since we now have an air-conditioned building, it seemed a perfect opportunity to maintain our contact and friendship with the terrific people we have met in our classes and to learn whether or not our new location was suitable for summer dances.   So far the experience has been positive.  Perhaps we will decide to host summer dances next year. 

 	August 4th over sixty dancers gathered for our club picnic at Joanne and Don Oja’s farm.  Their farm is the perfect location for this event.  This year was especially fun as we were treated to a table side magic show put on by our own magician, John Kaleta.  People are still trying to figure out how he got the 8 ball out of the playing card box!  

     Saturday, September 7th, will be the first dance in our regular dance season.  We will resume our normal format with rounds at 7:30 to 8:00, plus dancing from 8:00 to 9:45, and a break with snacks following the dance.

     Our lesson schedule will also resume in September.  The first lesson night is scheduled for September 9th.  Plus lessons will be from 6:30 to 7:30, basic from 7:30 to 9:00 and mainstream 9:00 to 9:30.  We had a lot of fun with the great people in our lesson groups last year, and we are hoping for a repeat performance.
