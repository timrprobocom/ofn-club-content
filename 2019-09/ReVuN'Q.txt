We had a good birthday dance and had some ice cream left so we brought some root beer and finished the ice cream off with floats. Not a bad idea, either.
The club is still doing some summer review of just dancing and slowly getting ready for lessons that start on September 12. With September on the horizon, our dance times will change back to the full three hours for our variety of dancers.
6:30-7:15   Review of previously learned rhythms
7:15-7:45   Dancing/floor time for dancers
7:45-8:30   Rumba lessons
8:30-9:30   Phase 4+ and higher dancing
Spread the news and share and we hope to see you soon at our hall. Marilyn Schmi
