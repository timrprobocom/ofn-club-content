Happy September. It is hard to believe that summer is almost over. Fall is gearing up to be loads of fun with the Corn & Cluck dance on September 20.

Mainstream Lessons will begin on Wednesday September 11 at 6:30 pm at the Salem Square Dance Center.  Bring a friend to try this wonderful activity.

We will be dancing on October 4 and October 18. See you all on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
