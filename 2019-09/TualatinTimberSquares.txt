 On July 10th we were Dark because our caller, Janienne, was on vacation.  I hear that she had a really great time.
We had nearly two squares at our July 24th dance.  We all had a great time.
 Some of us attended the Summer Festival in Salem.  Janienne called for one hour that Saturday morning, and  then again for another hour at the Mid Winter Festival Promo Party.  She got us through some figures that many of us have not danced in a long time, or hardly at all.  It was great to do something different for a change.
Our next scheduled dances are on September 11th and 25th.  As always, a reminder: if the temperature on the day of the dance reaches 90 degrees or above, we may cancel the dance.  We will let everyone know when this happens.
 Our club continues to be a fun place where friends gather, have some food and practice moves they want to work on before the weekend dances.  Lots of belly laughs to go around.  We would love to have you come join us!
 See you around in a square....
