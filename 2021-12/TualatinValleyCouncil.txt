 The October TVC meeting was held via Zoom.  We will continue the Zoom meetings through at least November.  The search for a new venue for our in person meetings is ongoing.
 The annual TVC NYE dance has been mostly finalized.  Details known at this time are date, time, venue, and callers/cuers.  It was decided to have a start time of 7:00pm, ending at 10:00pm, with a New Years celebration in synch with New York at 9:00pm.  So, on December 31st please join us at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro featuring Darrell Kalmbach & KC Curtis calling with Tami Helms & Julie Stiers cueing.  The door donation will be $8 to cover increased costs of two callers and cuers.  What is NOT known at this time is whether or not there will be a requirement for proof of vaccination to attend.  The clubs are being polled and consensus will decide at the November TVC meeting.  The results will be updated on the NYE flyer at the end of November following the TVC meeting.  The flyer, awaiting the Covid information, is currently under special dances in the OFN.  
 Two more TVC clubs have resumed dancing which brings the number of clubs dancing to eight: Columbia River Dancers, Eager Beavers, Hoedowners, Mix 'n Mingle, Oak Hills Squares, Sunset Promenaders, Toe Draggers, and Valley Squares.  See their individual reports below.  Most, but not all, require proof of vaccination to attend.  All are subject to the State mask mandate.
