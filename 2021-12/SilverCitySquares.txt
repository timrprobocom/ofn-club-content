Our Mainstream lessons are going well. We have 11 youth taking lessons! Some of them joined us at our November Dance where we enjoyed the calling of Ian Craig and the cueing of Julie Stiers. We also had a good ham dinner.

We started both Plus lessons and 2-step lessons in November. More later how that is going.
