Well, fall is here, and it really is dancing weather; rainy, and cool with a glimpse of sun and long nights perfect for dancing.  We’ve spent the last month on the dance floor taking cha lessons and after a long hiatus, we’ve gone to a couple of flashback movies; James Bond “No Time to Die” and “Dune”.  Bond was up to his usual shenanigans with his gun, fast car, and lady friends.  As for “Dune”, I read that book 50 years ago and wondered if I’d pronounced the names correctly.  We saw it at an Imax theater because I wanted the worms to be as big as possible!  What a journey and inspired by our own Oregon Dunes.  What do these movies have to do with square dancing?  Both are as timeless and we were full of anticipation just like square dancing.  It’s as much fun now as the first time you took lessons.  So, grab a mask and join us on the dance floor!
 The Hoedowners had two dances in October, on the 9th Scott Zinser called and Connie Clark cued. A big thanks to all who attended.  On October 23rd we held a Costume Dance.  Leonard Snodgrass and Julie Stiers were on the stage calling and cueing.  It was fun to dress up in costumes once again.  Some of the characters who came were Doug Morgan as Mr. Clean, Colleen Van Winkle a 20’s flapper and Sara Richmond as super villain Poison Ivy.  Dennis Laughlin was Gomez and Doreen Laughlin won first prize with her fabulous Morticia Adams costume.  A big thanks to Darlene Ditsworth for the generous gift basket.
 December’s dance on the 11th will be our Jingle Bells Dance, we’ll provide the bells.  Since the 4th Saturday in December is Christmas Day, we hope everyone will celebrate and enjoy the holidays.
