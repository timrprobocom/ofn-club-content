We had hoped to start off November by hosting an advanced dance to recorded music in Hall B at the Emerald Square Dance Center, but due to low interest and caution because of the numbers of COVID-19 cases, the Nov. 7th dance was canceled.  We are still hopeful that the proposed Nov. 21st dance will take place.  Please always watch for Fred Beisse’s email surveys and respond as quickly as you can if interested in participating in these Sunday two hour sessions.   Fred always finds some great callers for us to dance to.  Obviously, since we haven’t danced much in the past 18 months or more, there will be lots of catching up to do once we start up again.  If/when we don’t get going, perhaps we can in Keep on dancing and put all this behind us.

In the meantime if you think you will want to participate, please keep in mind that proof of vaccination is required for the protection of all the dancers and as long as the Governor mandate is in effect, masks will be required.  No food or drink except for your own consumption, please.
