It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas but first is Thanksgiving! We are so thankful to all of the dancers who continue to show up each dance. Without each other our beloved activity would cease to be. We are also thankful to the other clubs who are dancing and we are trying our best to support them as well.

Our 5th Friday Plus Halloween dance was an enormous success. Two squares plus for Advanced dancing and five squares on the floor for the rest of the evening. The costumes were great, Callers Randy Dibble and Don Wood did a fantastic job, Cuer Randy Lewis was great and Marie Wood joined the fun.

Our first Friday dance in November had four squares on the floor the entire evening. Such fun to have so many dancers enjoying themselves.

Our Christmas dance will be December 17 and we are looking forward to our 5th Friday New Year's Eve Dance on December 31. A flyer will be posted soon.

As the holidays move into full swing, let us take the time to be thankful for all that we have. Let us move forward with hope in our hearts, smiles on our faces and looking for better days ahead. May you all have a blessed Thanksgiving with family and friends.

See you on the dance floor.
