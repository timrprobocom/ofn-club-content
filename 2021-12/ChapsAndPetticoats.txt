Thank you, Portland Area Council (PAC), for encouraging clubs to visit Chaps and Petticoats on November 5th.  I think we had three squares - that was one more than we now have at regular dances under the governor’s ‘Mask’ mandate. Thank you, Scott Zinser and Leonard Snodgrass, for a fun evening.  

On December 3rd our Caller and Cuer will be:  Scott Z. and Julie Stiers!  We will share the Christmas season at our dance on December 17th with Ian Craig and Julia Buchheit on stage…we hope to see you there - HO, Ho Ho.  Please remember Chaps and Petticoats have CANCELLED our 3rd-Sunday Dance on December 19, 2021. 

Our Club will meet on December 6th to discuss our future 3rd-Sunday dances.  Be sure to check our Chaps and Petticoats website for more information.  

Happy Feet
