 Eager Beavers have been enjoying good attendance at our Monday afternoon Plus dances with our great caller/cuer teams.  We will dance four Mondays in December and hope you will come join us!  December 20th will be our Christmas dance, great day to wear that favorite Christmas outfit.  Please note that we currently require proof of vaccination as well as the mandated face masks or shields.  If mandates change we will indicate that on our website.
 We had a good turnout for our Halloween dance October 25th.  Many of our members got into the spirit of costumes or wearing Halloween colors/prints.  Colleen and David went all out wearing the best costume of the day.  We posted a few picture collages in the photo section November OFN.  Please take a look.  Our club is so happy to be dancing every week and have dancers visiting that are coming because everyone is vaccinated. 
 We are planning on Plus Lessons starting on Monday February 14th.  This could change if Covid becomes more of a problem in the new year.  Our lessons will be on Mondays prior to our regular plus dance which starts at 1:00 pm.  More to follow.
 To quote Rachel Nettleton, our long time club reporter, about this challenging year since she has moved and the adjustments along with Covid.  "Hug your friends and family.  Bury irritations under the fallen leaves and compost them into a new purpose".  We miss you Rachel.
 We are blessed to have three wonderful callers and great cuers.  We dance refresher Plus and Phase II and III rounds.  For our schedule visit www.EagerBeavers.info
