Willamette Squares hosted their birthday dance in October. Attendance was down, but those who were there had an enjoyable time dancing and enjoying birthday cupcakes and ice cream Dixie cups. There were multiple door prizes given out and our usual split the pot. 

We will be holding our regular square dance the 4th Saturday of November. Due to Covid restrictions there will be no potluck, but we will have an assortment of hard candies and mints available. Feel free to bring your leftover wrapped Halloween and Thanksgiving candies to share, (that is, if you havenâ€™t already consumed them all.)

Willamette Squares will be dark in December, as our regular 4th Saturday dance falls on the 25th, Christmas Day! We will be back on schedule in January on the 4th Saturday as usual. Our January dance can be considered as a warmup for the Mid-Winter Festival at the Linn County Fairgrounds which takes place the weekend following our dance at the Salem Square Dance Center. We encourage attendees of Mid-Winter to sign up as early as possible. We hope to see you in a square.
