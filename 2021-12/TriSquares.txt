We're still having board meetings by Zoom and monthly membership "Gabfests" by Zoom.  At present our board members do not feel safe dancing, especially with the new Covid variant at large.  In November we are going to poll all our members once again, to see how they would feel about beginning to dance again in January.  But the way this pandemic goes up and down, everything is very hard to predict.
