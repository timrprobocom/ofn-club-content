We are happy to be back to dancing again twice monthly after all the restrictions and closures due to the pandemic. We are dancing every second and third Saturday from 7:30 to 9:30 PM . Masks are required and if you do not have one, we will provide one for you. We dance at the Milwaukie Community center at forty second and Jackson in Milwaukie. We are ready to welcome guests to our dances and hope you will come join us for an evening of friendship and dancing.

The Milwaukie Community center has changed its mask requirement. If you use a face shield, it must be a FULL shield that covers the entire face instead of the small plastic half shields that cover only nose and mouth. The cloth face masks are still acceptable. These new requirements are posted in the hall. 

Happy Dancing.
Carol Mendenhall
