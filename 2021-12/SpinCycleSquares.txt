Spin Cycle Squares is meeting socially at the hall albeit being socially distant.  We meet Sundays from 4 - 6 at the square dance center at 2095 Yolanda in Springfield.  Our dances are always casual dress.  Right now we are not doing shared food.  Dancers please bring your own water.  Vaccinated dancers please and thank you.   Call president David Lajoie at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are meeting and/or DANCING!  And hopefully, by the time you are reading this we are back to dancing!  Our caller, Tim Matteson, makes sure the level is spot on for the floor.  Fun to be had by all!
