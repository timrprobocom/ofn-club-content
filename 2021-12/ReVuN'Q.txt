We had a successful month of October with our rumba class of eight continuing each week. We only lost three from the start but the remaining ones are doing very well and picking up the new moves quickly. We review each week from the previous week and move on. We are still working on Waltz 3 & 4 during the second class later in the evening. The moves in that class get trickier each week and require more practice to get it down.
	
We had a special dance in October called “Don’t Match” and some of the dancers played along. Pictures were on Facebook.
	
We will be dark for Thanksgiving to celebrate the family time together and working on a Pre-Holiday dance in December to wear our Christmas finery and get dressed up. 

Since this is the last report for 2021, the club is sending holiday wishes to everyone. Take some time to think about the last year we have survived and what the next year can bring to all of us. Happy Dancing!
