 It's the last month of the year.  Come join us at our dance on Saturday, December 18, 7-9 pm at the Aloha Grange.  We will be celebrating Christmas and New Years.  Yes, masks or shields are required until the State and the Grange declare otherwise.  We are keeping record of our dancers so if you haven't signed up with your information, please do so.  Let's keep hope that this Covid virus will be under control in 2022 and our life can go back to normal.  Stay well.  Dance, Dance, Dance.  
 Hope to see you in a square,
  Carolene Siebert
