We are still trying to get enough students for our beginner lessons at the Tillamook Elks Lodge on Tuesdays.  We are having a difficult time recruiting.  Our regular dances continue to be suspended until further notice due to lack of participation.  For up to date information see: www.wavesteppers.org.
