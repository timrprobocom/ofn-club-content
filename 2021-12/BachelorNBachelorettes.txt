Our biggest news is that after 56 years, we will be changing our dance nights to 1st, 3rd and 5th Wednesday nights after the first of the year.  We will review our average attendance this April and add or drop more dances as needed.  It would be a good time to come and visit your old friends at the B&B’s and support the club.

Also, keep in mind that if the forecasted temperature is to fall below freezing, and there is moisture on the road, we’re probably not dancing.

For a very special dance coming up, note our Pre-New Year’s Eve Dance December 29th, our last dance of the year.  We won’t charge an exorbitant price like some places of entertainment; it will be our usual $7 door donation for a really neat night.  You won’t even need reservations!  Just come on over and enjoy yourselves.
