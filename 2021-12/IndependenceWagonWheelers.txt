As the new reporter for a while, our club is dancing the first and second Saturdays of each month at Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall, OR. Our caller and cuer are George and Patty Hermann. We have had small attendance but we are still dancing and picking up more dancers each dance we have.
	
The second Saturday of December is our Christmas dance and Silent Auction.
This is always a great dance and we hope to see lots of smiles and happy feet there.
Since there are only two clubs that are having lessons in the council, the new dancers dance might be postponed until the spring so that other clubs who start lessons in January can attend when March and April arrive. 

We have had a couple of resignations in our officers and our new President is Eugene (Bonnie) Ivy and the new reporter is Marilyn (Ron) Schmit.

We have lots of room in our hall, so come and visit. We start at 7 p.m. Marilyn Schmit
