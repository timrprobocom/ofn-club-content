Valley River Dancers has not yet set a start up date for dances and lessons.  We will be meeting in November to determine the possibility of beginning to start dances in December and lessons in January.  But until we have our meeting there is nothing firm to report.  
 Wishing those who are dancing - Happy dancing! and wishing you all a wonderful holiday season!
