Is your closet bulging at the seams?  Are you hankering to recycle some of your older square dance or round dance clothes?  Or, have you moved on and are no longer able to join in the festivities.

Well, Mid-Winter Festival is fast approaching.  For many of you it provides an opportunity to recycle a few or many of those outfits taking up space in your closets.  For others, it is a sad time when you are saying, “I just can’t dance anymore”, and you want someone else to enjoy those beautiful outfits you have received so much pleasure wearing over the years.

But first let’s look closely at some key tips to selling your clothing items at Mid-Winter Festival 2022.  Follow closely the on-line instructions and email your list of items in by January 17, 2022.  

Note:  If you are having any problems completing the form on line, then by all means hand write it and mail it in.  We will input it to the computer for you.  This will save you a lot of time at the consignment tables when you deliver your items to Mid Winter.  If you snail mail your list, it must be received by January 10, 2022.
Please, read the instructions very, very carefully.

Make sure the items are clean and in good repair. Square and Round dance clothing only, please.

Bring your items, listed by categories to simplify the tagging process to the consignment tables.

If you have sets, keep/place them together.  This will help in the tagging process and may even help them to sell.

Please, be early to consignment.  Be sure to check the hours and plan on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning so they will be prominently placed on the racks for the opening sales activity Friday evening.

As with so many activities it is getting more and more difficult to get volunteers to help.  Resale Clothing is one of those areas that require a large number of volunteers to make it available for all the dancers.  

We can no longer accept clothing items at the festival that were not listed for consignment before the input deadline.

We are sorry it has come to this.  But we hope you will utilize the on-line submission process.  Or you can hand write it and send it to us.  Just print out the input/submission sheet for completion by hand.  We want to help you recycle the many beautiful outfits that you all have. 

As I said earlier we require a large number of volunteers to assist during consignment and sale hours.  We will accept any help, even if for just one (1) hour.  So, contact the volunteer coordinator for Resale Clothing – Sheila - and let her know you want to help.

Don’t forget to pick up your returns by 10:00 a.m. on Sunday morning.

For assistance contact the following individual -- preferably by email. 
 
Sheila Machado at sheilainsalem@hotmail.com or if you must call my phone at 
503-884-0158.

We will be adhering to all Covid-19 restrictions that are in place at the time.

To All Dancers – 

We are planning to have Mid-Winter Festival 2022. Right now our biggest concern is getting people registered to come to the Festival. Our second biggest concern is that they will enjoy themselves during Festival.

As far as requiring masks, the answer is – WE DON’T KNOW FOR SURE – we have stated that we will be following the state required mandate that is in place at the time of Mid-Winter. We won’t know what that will be until we get much closer to Festival than we are right now.

IF masks end up being needed, we will not dictate as to style of mask or face shield. We will not be monitoring dancers to make sure that they are worn on the floor – it is too easy for one to slip out of place while dancing.

We will NOT be asking people to be vaccinated NOR will we be asking for vaccination verifications. Since our facility is not asking us for any verifications, we will not be doing any.

Just by looking at someone – there is NO WAY to tell if someone is vaccinated or not. If someone volunteers information, that is up to them – be polite, don’t ask.

What we WILL ask people to do is to follow established SQUARE DANCE ETTIQUETTE.
This includes 
*	Joining a square closest to you that is forming.
*	Not running through a square to get to another square.
*	Don’t leave a square that you have already joined. However, if you have to drop out during a tip – have someone replace you. If you know you might not make it through a tip – arrange for someone to watch you and be able to come take your place.
*	Be polite to the others in your square.
*	Help make the square enjoyable for all 8 people in the square. 
  *	Don’t get frustrated/mad at mistakes – yours or others. Everyone makes them.
  *	Help out others who aren’t quite sure of what they are doing. You were in their place once.
  *	Have fun and smile. You can still feel a smile through a mask.
*	Get up and help fill out a square.
*	Don’t criticize other dancers.

We will have hand sanitizer available in all halls in multiple locations. Washing hands and using hand sanitizer is encouraged. We will NOT be monitoring people to see if this is done.

We are asking people to please bring their own refillable water bottles. This is a cost cutting decision to not have the water coolers available in all of the halls. There is a bottle refill as part of the water fountain in Willamette Hall. Also – no glass containers, plastic and metal only for safety concerns. If you forget your bottle or loose it, the youth will have reusable water bottles for sale at their table in the Mainstream Hall.
Please help us keep Mid-Winter alive for future years and dancers – come and dance with us.
