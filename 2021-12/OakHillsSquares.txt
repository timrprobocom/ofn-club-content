Come an join us for some fun Square dancing.  Our caller at the present time is Mark Wheeler who is taking our group through the Square dance calls in order to get us back to where we were back in March 2020.
 Our club wants to open it up to everyone that has a vaccination card and is willing to wear a mask or visor.  This is something like a workshop and dance combined.  So, everyone gains experience and has fun doing so. We are a group that out to have fun dancing
