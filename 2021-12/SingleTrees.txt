I am pleased to report that our October 22nd dance which had a Halloween theme was very well attended with four squares on the floor, dancing to Jim Hattrick’s calling and cueing.  Our friends to the north, Salem Swingin’ Stars and friends, came down to join us brining at least 11 or 12 dancers.  Thank you once again to Sheila Machado and Ronda and Bob Whaley for leading the group to us.  Bob and Ronda were our second prize winners for their costumes (see photo collage posted to photos in this edition).  What a great, fun event to make our hearts sing.  We hope this trend will continue with our November dance on the 26th with Craig Abercrombie and on Saturday, Dec. 18 with George Hermann.  We also hope our cuer Jackie Gale will once more be able to join us and keep our round dancers happy.

As some of you  know, Janet Geiger, one of our members, has been trying out her calling skills and recently has become engaged to a fellow square dancer from the Medford area.  Congratulations, Janet.  She and her fiancé won third place in the costume contest but we didn’t learn of her engagement until we saw her at the Buckeroo barn on October 30. 

We dance from 7:30 to 10:00PM on the 4th Fridays of every month unless an event or holiday prevents us,  starting with 15 minutes of pre-rounds, phase 2 – 3, then 15 minutes of plus with Mainstream starting at 8 with every third tip plus.  At this time masks or other face coverings are required with no food or drink to be shared but perhaps by December if we are lucky the mandate will be lifted and we will hold our annual Christmas dinner before the dance at 6:30PM—potluck with ham and rolls, provided by the club.  We’ll see.  Meanwhile we will dance and have fun!

See you in a square,
