Greetings from the Toe Draggers!  I am very happy to report that after much debate and discussion, Toe’s will resume dances as scheduled on1st and 3rd Fridays.  Masks will be required at all times. We will not provide any food, but water will be available. KC Curtis is our caller, and Connie Clark will cue for us the 1st dance of the month, with guest cuers on the 2nd dance.
 Dances will be held from 8:00 to10:00pm. 1st dance will be pre rounds at 7:30. 2nd dance will be pre squares at 7:30. We will have split the pot and announcements at 9:30.
 The December 3rd theme is Rockin’ Round the Christmas Square, (Please bring a can of food for the food basket or a new unwrapped toy. Both will benefit the community).  Our  December 17th theme is Night Before Christmas.
 Our door donation has changed from $6 to $7.00 a person.  Please come join us at the Kinton Grange.
