As I write this column I suddenly felt a sense of relief.  Relief that this year is coming to a close.  A relief that thing are going back to some sense of normality.  That we as a square dance community are slowly coming together with less of a feeling of fear of the unknown.  And a sense that the glass is more half full than half empty.
 The Columbia River Dancers have slowly seen our dances bring back people we have not seen for a long time.  Now as the Christmas and the New Year seasons are coming, we have put together a series of dances that will gladden those who want to celebrate with those of us who love to dance.
 Our first Friday dance on December 3rd has been canceled as the Grange had been rented last year for a play.  In lieu of our regular lesson night on the 5th, we are hosting a "New Dancers" dance that evening.  Jim Hattrick, our nationally known caller, will be putting together the beginning 52 commands in ways to make everyone enjoy themselves.  Check our website for the times.
 New lessons will begin the 11th and will continue on 18th starting at 6 PM for beginners and mainstream at 7.  No lessons on Christmas Day.
 Our December 17th Dance will have Jim calling and cueing songs of the season.  Then comes New Years Eve when the club will be hosting the Back Porch Duo featuring Adam Christman and Jim Hattrick. This is a great way to celebrate the end of this topsy-turvy year.
 Lastly, as this crazy, mixed up year comes to a close I want to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and the Happiest of New Years.  Jan and I look forward to seeing you in a square soon.  Perhaps this week or next?
