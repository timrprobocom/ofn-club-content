If you have not yet registered, please consider doing so. The registration form is on the Mid-Winter website and also on the Federation website.

He has a lot of great ideas for promoting classes and square dancing in general. I am sure he will be more than willing to assist you in any way he can.

Meanwhile, get out and support the clubs that are hosting dances and, on behalf of Patty and I, have a Merry Christmas and…
