The Sunset Promenaders had both our mainstream anniversary and our plus anniversary dance and both were a success.
 We dance mainstream on 1st and 3rd Saturdays at the Odd Fellows Hall in Hillsboro from 7pm till 9:30 pm. The Plus Dancers dance 1st, 3rd, and 5th Thursdays of the month at the same location and with same times, 7 to 9:30 pm.  Our attendance requirements are still in place, masks and proof of vaccinations required.
 The plus dance on the 30th will be dark because the TVC New Years Eve dance is on the next evening.
 We are still having intermediate round dance work shops on Sundays at 3.30 at our hall.
