Our next scheduled dance is January 30, 2021, but with Mid-Winter being cancelled I doubt we'll be able to hold a dance here in Springfield.  Very sad but prudent. 
 
We understand there are New Year's dances scheduled, and we hope all precautions are being taken.  Most of us are staying home Christmas and New Year's Eve so we can gather with loved ones next year.
 
We did lose one of our older but newer square dancers to COVID-19.  His wife got it also but is hanging in there.  It's very sad.  Our prayers go to everyone affected by this virus.  
 
Stay healthy everyone and continue being safe!
