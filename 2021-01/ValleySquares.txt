 We're all so anxious to get back to square dancing and back to a normal life it's a wonder we're not going crazy.  I will be taking the vaccine when it is available to me just so I will know I can dance without worry.  I hope everyone who dances gets the vaccine first as well.  We need to protect each other.  It still may take several months for everyone to get the vaccine.  
 The Callers are planning how to restart square dancing.  So far they have come up with a plan of 49 calls to start and expand from there.  I think we will progress rather fast  although we may not remember immediately all the movements, we will, with a little practice, have retained a good deal of them.  They have been in our brain for so long.  I can't remember all the names of calls when asked, but when the Caller says them, I just do them, it's so ingrained.  
 Like everyone else, Valley Squares is remaining dark for now.  Take care and get your vaccine.
