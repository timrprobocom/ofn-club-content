Hello from the Happy Hoppers.  And greetings of the season!  We hope you're staying healthy and sane and looking forward to good things in the new year.  Things like getting ahead of the dreaded pandemic and getting back to dancing.
Being able to give your friends a hug!  Being able to see your family up close and not through Zoom.  Being able to put 2020 behind us.  I hope you're able to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Some of us are still doing Zoom meetings to connect----Tom and Liza are still giving us their time and energy---so blessed to have them in our circle.  Some of the ladies from our club have been meeting twice a week on Zoom to do art and share camaraderie.  I've heard that some of us are meeting to bowl----when the lanes are open.  We see so many people out walking.  Many more than before the pandemic hit and hopefully that habit will endure.  We humans are so resilient.  So here's to the endurance we will still need!  A heartfelt "Happy New Year" from all of us at Happy Hoppers!
