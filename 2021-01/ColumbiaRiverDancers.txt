 It was the month after Christmas and nary a dance
 With the Covid near why take a chance,
 The vaccine is coming and then we’ll dance.
 We’ll swing our partner and square thru four,
 And pant and puff and dance some more.
 We wish we had all the answers.  Until then stay safe.  From your friends at The Columbia River Dancers.
