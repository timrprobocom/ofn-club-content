A song: think “Oh Little Town of Bethlehem” 

Oh square dance halls of Oregon, how still we see thee lie
Thy empty floors and bolted doors are enough to make us cry.
But comes a vaccine soonest to put things back to right,
And we’ll begin to dance again long into the joyful night.

Til then it’s social distancing, and video meets by Zoom,
To see our friends ere the virus ends, and our dances can resume.
When we can gather together to frolic and laugh once more,
Our true delight will burn more bright, and thrill us to the core.

If we all stick together, there’s no hurdle we can’t dislodge
So, COVID you can pass on through, while we others walk and dodge.
We wish our fellow dancers happiness and health and cheer,
And double the fun in 21 to make up for this year.
