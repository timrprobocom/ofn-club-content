Happy New Year to our fellow dancers.  As I write this, it is December 1, and it is chilly outside. We have leaves that need to go out to the street, so hopefully later this week.
	
We have not danced since the first week of November when the Salem Square Dance Center was shut down. I am not a quitter, so I am still thinking positive that the dance hall will open just in time for a New Yearâ€™s Eve dance for the round dancers. Send some positive vibes to the hall owners and the Governor for some assistance.
 
I continue to send out emails to let the dancers know how things are going and to see if any of them will reply back with concerns.
	
We will be back dancing as soon as the hall opens, so stay tuned to Facebook and emails for any updates.
	
January is my birthday month, so I plan on trying to have a happy day during the month.
