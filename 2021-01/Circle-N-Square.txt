Greeting from Yreka,
We do not have any dance news to report. We are still hoping and waiting for Covid restrictions to ease or lift so that we can attempt to get back to dancing. As it looks now... mid February may be our first attempt at dancing. I assume most everyone knows our dances are held at Evergreen Elementary School so we are still at the mercy of school restrictions and regulations Our classes and workshops were being held at the Karuk Wellness Center, but they are also under certain restrictions which prevent us from dancing. Speaking for Sherrie and I, we sure do miss dancing, and we too will  As we approach the end of this crazy year we want to wish everyone  a happy, safe, and healthy holiday season.
