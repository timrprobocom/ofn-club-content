 We've been having bi-monthly Zoom board meetings for a while, since "business" is so small.  But we also decided to have a full-membership Zoom meeting, every third Monday evening of each month, just to see everyone, and that's really been great!  We catch up with each other and chat about what everyone's doing, which is...well...you know...in this pandemic, practically nothing!  But it's funny how long you can enjoy chatting with your friends about nothing!  Because it's just so good to see them.  About half our members have shown up for our first two "gabfests" and we're looking forward to next month's.  I'm hopeful that with the new vaccinations coming we might all be square dancing next fall!
 So keep exercising and stay in shape.
