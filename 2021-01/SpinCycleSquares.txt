Well, we decided not to rent the hall and socially distance inside.  The more we thought about it the scarier it seemed to get.  Some of our members would have opted out anyway.  We are thinking about Zoom though which is a nice option.  We do what we can. 

Tim Matteson has been our caller for many years now.  His mom is hanging in there and has a caregiver during the week when Tim is working at the chocolate factory.  She is slowly regaining strength. 
Stay safe and healthy,
