What a year of change! Our last dance was our 60th Birthday in March. Not only no dances, but no picnic, no Koast Krash, no demonstrations, and no social interactions. I think that is almost harder than no dancing. Square dancing is such a social activity and that is just the reason it may be a while before we can start back up. One wonders just how many people will drop out because we are out of the habit of dancing once or twice a month! We hope you all had the best Holiday season possible and have a safe and Happy New Year. LaVerne
