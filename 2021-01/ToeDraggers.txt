Since there's not much clubs news, we thought we would update you about our dear caller, KC Curtis.  KC had the misfortune of being hospitalized with the coronavirus in October.  Ten others at his church also caught the virus, but he was the only one hospitalized.  KC was given the same medicine the President had (Regeneron) and it turned the virus around 180 degrees.  He went home after 3 days in isolation, feeling exhausted but recovering.  Then, just when he was feeling like doing almost normal things, he went back to the hospital with a UTI that turned into a staph infection.  With high doses of antibiotics, he was sent home five days later but had to give himself IV infusions 3 times a day for 2 weeks.  Fortunately, he's now recovering nicely and driving Linda crazy.  In KC's words, "I am feeling very mean and ornery so I must be doing pretty good."
