Happy New Year!  There are no mistakes in 2021 yet but I suspect there is some creative person out there working hard to create one.  I just hope it is a minor one. 
 A brave new year is beginning.  I think most of us are glad that 2020 is over.  
Did any of us have plans for 2020 that were not turned topsy turvy?  I was force to cancel a trip to England planned since 2015 for a family reunion.  If you are reading this then you are a survivor of one heck of a stressful year and for that we should thankful.  
 You have suffered a year of politics like no other, a pandemic, and dance deprivation, but endured.  Give yourself a hug and say “congratulations to me” and remember “if it doesn’t kill you, it makes you stronger”.  I am not sure I believe that old saying. 
 If you find you are still angry about someone or thing you have a choice to make.  You can look for a way to fix it or carry a grudge. Carrying a grudge only hurts one person, you.  The ‘grudgee’ does not even know it exists. Resolve that in 2021 you will reach out to someone to tear down the wall between you.  One by one you and I can make 2021 a good year to remember.  
 I know it will be a good year when we get back to dancing.  I know we will.  Already there is a vaccine coming out that will protect us.  It will take time but we will dance again.  
 Do not just hope for a better year, be part of the process.  Keep the faith and keep checking for our start date at www.EagerBeavers.info.
