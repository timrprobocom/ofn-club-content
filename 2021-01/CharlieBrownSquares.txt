We are still waiting for the day we can start dancing. We miss everyone very much.  At this point all dances and classes are canceled thru March. We will look at April when it gets closer.  We are still planning and hoping for Boatnik. We everyone has/had a wonderful holiday and we looking forward to getting back on the dance floor in 2021.
