Rogue Sis Q Council has postponed the Pajamarama  Mainstream dance until we have no restrictions and can safely have the dance.  This is one dance everyone will want to look for and attend.  You get to wear your best pajamas and dance.  We will announce the date as soon as we have the date.  The Pajamarama dance will be for anyone wanting to brush up on mainstream or had classes and didn't get to come to a dance when they graduated.

Southern Oregon sends prayers to everyone for a safe and healthy New Year. 

Hope to see you next year, things are looking up with the new vaccine availability.
