Ordinarily, January is the time to look forward to Mid-Winter Festival.  Since we are in a lock down once again, this event has been appropriately cancelled.  Take this time to relive memories of past festivals and hold on to memories of the fun we always have greeting old friends and getting to know new ones.  The fun and excitement will return once again for Mid-Winter Festival 2022.

I received an email in response to my December article on promoting round dancing and line dancing.  The writer is holding Zoom dancing every Monday for square dancing for one couple, Western line dancing, and international folk dancing as activities.  I’m looking into this, along with delegating a caller to help expand these activities, if that is feasible.  It should work, and give us an opportunity to get dressed up and get some exercise dancing on Zoom.  Stay tuned for more information; but in the meantime, do what you need to do to stay active and healthy.  Take a walk on the sunny days.

I continue to urge you to stay in touch with your club members.  Some type of newsletter that gives everyone an update on what is going on with your members is a great way to promote the fellowship that is the trademark of square and round dancers everywhere.

As we look to the future of getting this pandemic under control with immunization or whatever it takes, let’s stay positive that our “new normal” will include the dancing that we all love and can’t wait to get back to.  We look forward to dressing up for club dances, indulging in wonderful potlucks, and socializing with great friends.  Hugs again will be included in the “new normal”, too!!!

Swing Your Partner…………Enjoy this month of January and make the most of it!!!
