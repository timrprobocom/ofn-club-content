 A note from Mike St.Clair, President of TVC:  "There isnâ€™t a lot going on right know as most of you know.  The good news is that the vaccine for the pandemic is getting closer.  The bad news is that is going to take a while for life to get back to some what normal so we just need to hang in there and before we know we will be dancing again.  I cant believe it has been almost a year since we last had a dance.  Hope everyone is doing well and had wonderful holidays.  As the vaccine rolls out we will try to keep everybody update on how that will affect all of us.
 There has been some round dancing on a limited basis and some clubs looking at the first of the year trying to get together again on a limited basis.  We will keep everyone up on what is going on.  Keep In Touch and hope to see you all sooner rather than later.  Missing all of you, Mike"
 Normally the January TVC report would include a list of council clubs that were going dark for Mid Winter Festival.  It is too bad that I cannot report this again for 2021.  Maybe next year...  Remember to contact the Mid Winter organizers and roll your 2021 registration over to 2022.
