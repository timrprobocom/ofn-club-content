We all  seemed to find a different way to make "ringing in the new year” special, and although there’s very little happening right now with the M&M’s  (much like your with clubs), we have high hopes as to what 2021 will bring.  With the promise of available vaccines, maybe we will be able to gather again in the foreseeable future.  Fingers and everything else crossed!  
 We will keep you updated on calendar changes thru this OFN report as well as our website:  www.mixandminglesquares.org
