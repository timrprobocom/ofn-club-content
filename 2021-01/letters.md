title: Update from Charles and Margaret Vegas
---
Charles and Margaret Vegas (known as Charlie and Peggy), chairpersons of the 1990 Mid-Winter Festival, wanted to let you all know that their son, Joseph, passed away November 6.  They would like your prayers as they grieve.  They have recently moved back to this area from Florida and don't know a lot of people yet.
