No word as to when we can return to dancing.  At this point our club would only be dancing once a month and attending our sister clubs dances to keep up our skills.  But no one is dancing here in Oregon except perhaps Roseburg’s Buckeroos who have been able to hold a few dances up until the latest lockdown at any rate.
 
Stay safe and we’ll see you on the floor when all have been vaccinated.
