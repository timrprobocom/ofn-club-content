Well, here it is December already.  I am feeling optimistic because November only had 30 days unlike October which had 31 plus an extra hour with daylight savings and I know next month we will start gaining daylight.  Woohoo!
 What new and exciting things happened in November?  I discovered that I can ask Alexa to play music from a specific year.  If you have an Alexa, Google Nest or even an iPhone with Siri, you can ask them the same thing.  I started with 1950 and each day asked for the next year.  I heard lots of standards but some surprises too.  I heard Blue Velvet as a hit in 1955.  We all know Bobby Vinton made Blue Velvet a hit in 1963 duh!  Turns out it reached #14 in 1955 recorded by The Clovers, an R&B group, and Tony Bennett recorded it even earlier in 1950.
 There was way less Perry Como, Dean Martin and the other crooners in the 50’s then I imagined but the surprise was the amount of country.  Much of it had the twangy sound.  Yep, Hank Williams and Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Hank Snow, Ernest Tubb, etc.  If you Google country hits of the 50’s, you’ll see a list of the standards.  Folks were listening to the Grand Ole Opry on the radio and putting their dimes in the jukebox. Tennessee Ernie Ford had his TV show and who didn’t learn the words to Sixteen Tons?  All that music was part of the surge in popularity of our favorite hobby, SQUARE DANCING.  Country music is as popular as ever.  It even has its own television network so I’m thinking the music industry is still making the kind of music we like to dance to.  Here at the Hoedowners, we seem to be chugging along donating to the Grange Christmas Family and waiting for the Covid-19 numbers to go down and the restrictions to lift.  I go to the Aloha Grange occasionally to drop things off etc. and I can tell she is mighty lonely.  I sometimes switch on the lights in the ballroom just to see how she’s looking.  Can’t wait to turn on the music and twirl.
