Rumors still persist there is still some covert round dancing around our state, which sounds like much fun, but I wonder what Dr. Fauci would think of it all?

Realistically, social distance round dancing is probably no more risky than going to the grocery store, except when one dances with someone not of their household, in which case the risks exponentially increase.  (And the more one goes to the grocery store, the greater the risk.)  In the end, one has to be willing to weigh and accept the risks.  After all: one can be infected and have no symptoms.

Also, remember to wear a heavy coat when you get your covid vaccine.  If provider asks you to take off your coat, tell him/her that 90 degrees below zero is enough to give one frostbite!
