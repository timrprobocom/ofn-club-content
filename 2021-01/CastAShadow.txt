We continue to be dark along with most other square dance clubs in Oregon.  Our hall does not want to take any chances with the health of the people who might want to attend a square dance.  We will hope for an early vaccination process which will free many to start dancing again.  We miss seeing our fellow dancers and hope everyone will be able to stay safe and be able to return to dance with us next spring perhaps if all goes well.
 
Meanwhile, we hope your Christmas and New Yearâ€™s went well and that you were able to meet with family if only via social media and Zoom.  This will be a year for the history books for sure.
