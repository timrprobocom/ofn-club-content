With the year 2020 finally behind us, we look with hope to the future. It is our hope and prayer that we and all our fellow dancers will come through this pandemic in good health to see better days in this coming year. 

In preparation for this new year, several of our members have spent time getting our hall ready for the day we return. Our basement (where we hold our breaks) has a new ceiling and new lighting. It also has fresh paint. Both men’s and women’s bathrooms have been re decorated and painted. When that long awaited day comes that we can dance again, we will be ready for you.

Stay well and keep hope in your hearts. Happy New Year.
