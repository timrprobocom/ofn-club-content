     McMinnville's Alien Days Festival was great fun in May! What a wonderful variety of inventive alien costumes! While we waited for our float's turn in line, we watched a young boy in his spaceship rolling down the street, herded by his parents. Then there was the huge silver bus that parked right in front of it and a multitude of folks in silver tights spilled out of it and began to put together a rolling drum carrier. They had acrobats and their own band. 
     As another float pulled past us to join the parade, the four-piece band played 'I'll Fly Away' so KC had us square up and we danced to it. KC also called our dance that night and we were thrilled to have four squares, thanks to guests from several clubs. Many thanks to KC and Linda Curtis for a fun afternoon and evening! Carmen
