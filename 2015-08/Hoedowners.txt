June was bustin&rsquo; out all over with late summer temperatures; no overcast skies or drizzle.  Thank heavens those beautiful Oregon Hood strawberries were still available for our June 13th Strawberries and Cream dance.  The floor was swirling with 8 squares during mainstream and most everyone lingered for the strawberry buffet that followed.
 The weather turned scorching hot and we decided that we couldn&rsquo;t guarantee a comfortable dance experience with the Weather Channel forecasting 103 degrees for our June 27th Dad&rsquo;s Barbeque.  Well the forecasters are the luckiest type of employees; they don&rsquo;t get fired even when they&rsquo;re wrong.  The temperatures moderated into the 90&rsquo;s but most Hoedowners headed north to dance with the Columbia River Dancers.  It was warm wherever you went.  It&rsquo;s a June we&rsquo;ll not soon forget.
 Not to worry, our August 8th dance is our traditional Knobby Knees Dance.  That means were expecting dancers to come with knees exposed; short skirts, short pants, cut-offs, jogging attire, kilts, capris, just let your patella hang out!  Darrell Kalmbach will be our guest caller, Randy Lewis, cuer and ice cream sundaes on the menu.
 Not to belabor a point but August 22nd is our Hot August Nights Dance.  Hot August Nights is an annual vintage car show in Reno where the hot rods and muscle cars are the main attraction.  We promise to keep you cool with ice cold watermelon and if you have a cool car, drive it over for the evening. Stay cool,
