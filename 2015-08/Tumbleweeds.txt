Hello everyone ! How have you been getting along with this hot weather? Myself it has just about done me in, have to water just about every day and I have lost the battle with the lawn. Well the tumbleweeds had to cancel the picnic because of weather, but will reschedule. We had a visitation from B&B's.  Their aim to get their banner back it is nice to have them come dance with us. Not  much to report just to invite you to come and dance with us every Friday at 11:00 to 2:00 and have lunch with us in our air-conditioned hall.
