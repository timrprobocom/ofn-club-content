June 12th was our annual Reigning Cats and Dogs Dance, a benefit for Greenhill Humane Society.  KC Curtis called the squares and Helen Halley cued the rounds.  An excellent dance.
 
Scott Zinser and Christina Corelli did the honors for us on June 26th.  Our annual club picnic is scheduled for August 9th.  Terry Halley and Jackie Gale are on board for August 14th.

We look forward to our Hot August Nights/End of Summer Dance, Sandy Harris calling and cueing on August 28th. 

On a sad note, Ray Janisse, long-time square dancer, died recently.  Our condolences to his wife, Diann.
