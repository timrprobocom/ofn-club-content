If the Buckeroo Barn walls could talk they would not only be saying, but probably shouting, what a super fun time everyone had at the 41st Annual Round Up the week end of June 12-14th.  Scot and Erin Byars did a bang up job of keeping us entertained all week end, the weather was perfect for dancing, and it was great to see so many  old friends and new faces from out of town dancing at the Barn with us.  

Wearing casual attire and chowing down on ice cream sundaes (some were enough to impress Chef Jen Yee at New York&rsquo;s Lafayette) the ice cream &ldquo;Saturday Night Sundae&rdquo; dance was a great way, despite the heat wave, to kick off the start to summer.  

August is just around the corner, and along with the Dancing Friends and Timber 8&rsquo;s we plan on dancing at the Douglas County Fair in the evenings and hope you can join us.

Happy Dancing,
Rita Schuchard
