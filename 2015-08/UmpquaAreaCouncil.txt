Check out our flyer of the line up of the Callers & Cuers that will be at the Douglas County Fair this year (August 5th- 8th) razzle dazzling us with their talent.   If you love a good county fair, plan on coming to Roseburg, taking in the sights of the Fair during the day, and then join us on the dance floor in the evening.  Dancers (and yes, you need to be dancing) get into the fair free if you are wearing you square dance attire and badge.  Dancers do need to be wearing square or round dance duds and be proficient at the mainstream level to join us on the dance floor at the Fair.  We stop dancing about 9:00 pm so that leaves plenty of time to find an elephant ear, scone, or whatever tickles your fancy as far as fair food goes before the fair ends for the night.  Hope to see you at the Fair!
