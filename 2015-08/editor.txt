Many clubs have gone dark for the summer.  Please make sure that your club information
accurately reflects your dark dances.  Also, summer goes by very quickly, and that's
followed by lessons starting up in the fall.  September lessons start showing up
this month,  so please double-check to make sure your lesson information
is up to date.
