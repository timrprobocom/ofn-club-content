What a party we had for the retirement recognition dance combined with our 39th birthday. We had over 25 couples attend and dance with Ray and Virginia as we honored them for their recent retirement. We also had several friends and some family show up to sit on the sidelines to cheer everyone on and to greet the Walz&rsquo;s with hugs and lots of smiles. Pictures from the party have been posted on Facebook and will be sent to the OFN for posting there also.
     We have pretty much finished mambo and will be working on bolero steps for August as we prepare for fall lessons in an &ldquo;as of yet&rdquo; undecided rhythm. We did a demo at Summer Festival for the Showcase of Rounds. Hope those of you who attended, enjoyed it. 
     Come join us on Thursdays to dance Phase 3-4 rhythms with a great bunch of people and a good cuer in Cheryl Manley with the assistance of her husband, Geof. Marilyn Schmit
