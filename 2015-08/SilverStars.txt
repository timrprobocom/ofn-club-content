The Silver Stars have been having a very hot summer, as have many of the clubs.  We are dark for the summer but have enjoyed the many weekend events in the area, as well as the clubs who are dancing during the summer months.  

We have visitations planned as well as a club picnic.  We will start the dance season in September with Chuck Garner calling on September 12.  Dorothy Lowder is our cuer.  We dance at the Hazel Dell Grange with plus from 7 - 8, and mainstream from 8 - 10.  Happy dancing one and all, stay cool, and yellow rocks to all.
