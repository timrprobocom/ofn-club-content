Our third club to disband, in as many months, was the Columbia Gorge Plus.  Frankly, it is surprising that Hood River, and The Dalles, an area of over 22,000 people, cannot maintain even one square dance club.  Here is a riddle:  If there is not enough interest among 22,000 people for even one square dance club, how big of community is required to support a club, and how many clubs can the Portland area maintain?  We may find out in the next couple years.  The times are a changing, folks, and we need to consider why the ballroom clubs thrive, but square and round dance clubs continually shrink.  What are the differences between the two?  Are they reconcilable?  Or, another thought: Just because a club has &ldquo;always done it that way&rdquo;, is not a good business reason that it should continue that way.  It&rsquo;s why businesses change – to stay in business.
