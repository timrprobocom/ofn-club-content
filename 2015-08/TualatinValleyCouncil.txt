The next TVC event is our annual Hahn Barn Dance, a fifth Saturday dance on Saturday, August 29th. Daryl Clendenin will be our caller/MC with Yvonne Clendenin as our cuer/MC.  Other callers and cuers will be invited from the floor to call or co-call a tip. This is always a fun dance with a country social potluck picnic before the dance in the shade beside the lake.  The potluck picnic begins at 6:30 and you have about an hour before pre-rounds begin at 7:30 at the barn.  Mainstream with every third tip Plus is scheduled to begin at 8:00PM.
 Gary and Bette Hahn graciously offer their hospitality each year and it is always a grand time!  Their farm is located at 37280 NW Hahn Rd, Banks, OR 97106.  Call Gary Clark, 503-647-5742, for more information, or refer to the flyer in the OFN Flyer section.
 This dance has always been a great success because of the many dedicated volunteers who help make it happen.  We need set-up and clean-up crews for the picnic. We also need to clean the barn the morning of the dance. It is a great time to get to know other club members - so please recruit people from your club to help.  TVC volunteers, please send your name and activity you would like to help with to Dale Brabham, at dbrabham@mac.com
