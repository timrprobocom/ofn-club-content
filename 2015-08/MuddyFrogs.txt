The Milton-Freewater Muddy Frogs provided the entertainment for the Eastern Star State Convention in Pendleton in June.  In July, the Frogs, along with the Family-a-Fair club, provided entertainment at Yantis Park in Milton-Freewater as part of the local 4th of July celebration.  In August, we will be dancing in Yantis Park in Milton-Freewater from 11:00-1:00 as part of the Muddy Frogwater Festival.  August 30 will find the Frogs hosting the Blue Mountain Council for a 2018 festival  meeting at  12:30, a council meeting at 1:00 , and a dance from 2:00-5:00, with a barbeque following, all at Yantis Park in Milton-Freewater.
