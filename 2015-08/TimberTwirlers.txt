     Timber Twirlers are dark for the summer. We will start dancing again in Sept. We cancelled our club picnic in June as the temp's were going to be in the high 90's and just a little too warm for most of us.
     Some of us are getting around dancing at other clubs and going to festivals.
Life time member (and my partner) Al Felde had surgery for a cochlear implant on June 30 so hopefully this fall he will be able to hear and enjoy the dances a lot more.
     We are still looking for a new home for our club to use to dance, so if you know of someplace in the Albany area that might welcome square dancers at a reasonable price, let us know. My email is sandy.harris@comcast.net Enjoy the summer. Sandy
