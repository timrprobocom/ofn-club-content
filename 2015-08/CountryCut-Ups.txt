Independence Day was celebrated with a dance at the Boring Barn, in spite of the heat. It was a small, sweating crowd, but we still had fun dancing to caller, Terry Halley and cuer, Frances Herigstad . There was plenty of red/white/and blue in the hall, thanks to our club decorators and the colorful clothing on the dancers. No one seemed to mind missing the fireworks.

Summertime can be busy with gardens, barbecues, outings, and the like, but don&rsquo;t forget to support your local square dance club. I have heard it said, &ldquo;The more you dance, the better you feel!&rdquo; It is great physical activity as well as a fun, social time. We are grateful for those who have stepped up recently to fill in some vacant door and kitchen duty slots. If we all do our share, the club can thrive. Don&rsquo;t forget to start talking to your friend, relatives, coworkers, or enemies about square dancing. Lessons are coming up in September.
