We were honored to have such a large turnout for our Trophy dance on June 19th.  The Valley Squares took home the trophy with the highest percentage of attendance.  There were over 85 dancers on the floor.  A big thank you to Terry Halley and Sandra Pinion for a great time!
 The month of August tends to go by so fast!  Even during this busy season, make sure to stop by and visit the Tri Squares!  We will be having two dances during the month of August.  Our first dance will be held on August 1st, with the theme &ldquo;Tropical Isle&rdquo;.  Our second dance, on August 21st is themed a "Concert in the Park&rdquo;.  Both dances will start at 7:30 PM with 15 minutes of pre-rounds and 15 minutes of plus.  At 8PM we will start mainstream with every fourth tip plus.  Please note, that if temperatures reach over 90 degrees we will be dark.  Make sure to dress comfortably.  We would love to have visitors join us! 
 Our website is well kept and up to date.  Make sure to check out our page at www.trisquares.com.  We have information on our lessons, dance flyers, photos, contact information and much more!  See you in a square,
