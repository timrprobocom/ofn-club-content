 We lost special friends in the passing of club member Debra Wold and Tim Roberts' father, Norm in the month of June.
 July started out warm with a combined celebration for the USA and KC&rsquo;s birthday on July 3rd. 
 As we begin August we take our last world tour stop to Japan for our two Friday dances.  August 21st we&rsquo;ll celebrate the Festival of Aki Celebration.  Bring your stamped passport to see if you are eligible for the special prize drawing that evening.
 Where has our summer gone?  We&rsquo;ll begin in Sept with celebrating the Toe&rsquo;s Anniversary and our special dance, &ldquo;Who is Man Enough to Wear Pink&rdquo;, Sept. 12th a Saturday from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Kinton Grange.  All donations from the dance will go to the Susan G. Komen Foundation to help find a cure for cancer.
 We just have to share our excitement for KC and Linda Curtis.  They have accepted, along with their commitment to our club, to be the new caller team for the Buzzin&rsquo; Bees in Vancouver, WA.  It is so exciting to see KC and Linda taking on more responsibility to keep the square dance community strong and vital.
