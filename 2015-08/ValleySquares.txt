We lucked out on finding fresh, local strawberries from the Farmers' Market for our June 6th Strawberry Dance.  Thanks to Pete and Julie Cooper for their generous donation and to all the members and guests who joined in the fun.  By the next weekend, when looking for fresh berries for the Hoedowners' dance, I encountered lots of "Closed for the Season" signs at the farms, and depleted supplies at the markets.  It has been a strange year!
 Our members showed up in force at the Tri-Squares' Red, White & Blue Dance where we took home the traveling trophy - a wonderful way for Cheryl Kahler to end her term as VP in charge of Visitations.  Watch the OFN and the Valley Squares Website for your chance to steal it for your club.
 Our Summer Solstice dance, held in our air-conditioned hall, was fun and marked the beginning of this hot, dry spell.
 Lessons ended with our month-long Mainstream workshop.  Chuck challenged us with some all-position and dance by definition calls.  We hope our dancers use the summer to visit lots of different clubs.  In September, our Mastering Mainstream, followed by Beginning Plus lessons commence on Tuesday, September 15th: 6:30 for MM; 8:00 for Plus.
 Hope to see you at our dances August 5th and 19th.
