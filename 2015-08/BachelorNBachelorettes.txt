Aug 5, we are again going to have our largest dance of the year with national caller MIKE SIKORSKY and Tami Helms. It&rsquo;s always crowded, so come early for best parking.  It will be our luau dance. Grass skirts are welcomed, as we are casual for the summer. Just watch out for club gardener Maury Mowdown, who&rsquo;s threatening to bring his lawnmower!

We have a dance demo at the West Linn Old Time Fair on the 19, at 3:P.M.  I don&rsquo;t often go to fairs, but this is too tempting.  (I usually avoid temptation, unless I can&rsquo;t resist.) 

Towards the end of the month (on the 26th) will be our Back to School Dance, where school supplies will be accepted for a needy school. KC Curtis and Tami Helms will provide the entertainment.
