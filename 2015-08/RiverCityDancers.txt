Like most square dance clubs, River City Dancers have elected a new board with the advent of summer.  It&rsquo;s time to give everyone, old and new, a big-circle &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo;.  We call our board positions as if singular (i.e.-President, not Presidents) even when held by a couple).

Dave & Barbara Schmidt handed over the presidency to Greg & Sandy Peterson, who were last year&rsquo;s Vice President.  (It&rsquo;s traditional in RCD for VP&rsquo;s to become President the following year).  Larry & Penny Crow are taking over as Vice President.  Neal & Virginia Keefer are returning as Secretary;  Jim and Caron Clippard are carrying on as Treasurer.

Thanks, everyone, for steering us through last year, and continuing into 2016.  We are fortunate to have such good people, doing so many jobs, so well.
To name a few other behind-the-scenes folks are Philip and Michelle Wood, our outstanding and reliable editor; Susan & Marvin Shaw, our indomitable Sunshine Reporter; Jolene & Ed Cummings, our fabulous photographer; Carol Mendenhall & Gene Meyer, our friendly visitation liaison. 

Our clubs are fortunate to have &ldquo;sparks&rdquo; who provide that extra zip to our cherished activity, which involves much more than just dancing, as we all know.  I&rsquo;m thinking about June&rsquo;s recent celebration of Stanley & Norma Craig&rsquo;s 60th wedding anniversary, a combined effort of RCD and BnB&rsquo;s.  It was especially sweet to have their children attend.

Recent successful efforts have been the fund-raising for our hall; the giant basement sale spearheaded by Jim & Margi Adams; and the Ted Vigil/John Denver Tribute (and yummy bake sale) headed by Jim & Caron Clippard, plus the efforts of many volunteers.
As noted earlier, we were dark (our only time of the year) for Summer Festival in Klamath Falls.
