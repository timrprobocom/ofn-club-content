     The Willamette Squares enjoyed their June dance titled "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" and dancing was especially enjoyable during this current heat wave in the air-conditioned square dance center. The decorations consisted of bats and balls and the food was like you'd expect to be available at a baseball game: peanuts, hotdogs, chips, lemonade, and a variety of finger foods. The singing calls carried out the baseball theme. There was a friendship ring making a circle for the purpose of mixing up the dancers into squares. It was a fun dance.
      Shari and Mark, who met through square dancing, had a lovely wedding attended by a number of Willamette Squares members. Of course, our "purple Shari" made sure the purple theme was carried throughout. It was a beautiful ceremony, and, of course, there was plenty of food and music and dancing. We wish them happiness together.
     Willamette Squares got together for a meeting at the new home of Nancy and Gary Ohren. Nancy and Gary had hosted us before at their previous home overlooking the creek. They decided it was time to downsize so they sold their existing home and built their new one. It is lovely and we were able to see it and at the same time hold our business meeting. Congratulations to them on their beautiful new home. Jodee Howard
