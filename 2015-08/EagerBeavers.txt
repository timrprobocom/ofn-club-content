 July is the month we wonder where the time went while we enjoy the long summer days and fresh produce from the farmers&rsquo; markets. 
 We are in the process of finding callers and cuers who could carry on our best traditions and introduce us to new ones for the ongoing success of our club. After many years of putting up with a bunch of &ldquo;We do it our way&rdquo; dancers, our caller, George Clark, is retiring this fall.  Stay turned for announcements. 
 Our visitation to Hoedowners June 13th was a success with fifteen members coming to dance. The Hoedowners offered strawberries and ice cream which our members always enjoy as much as dancing. 
 Do not forget we invite other dancers to our annual beach trip September 16th – 18th in Garibaldi.  Square dancers have special rates at the Garibaldi Inn.  We have activities planned and there will be plenty of food.  We do like to eat.  For more information on activities and space call Nan at 503-291-1966.
 Members, please sign up to bring a dish to the annual picnic August 13th. I was sweetly asked to bring chocolate chip cookies.  It is pleasant to be appreciated.
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, Rounds 1:00 - 1:30; Plus 1:30 - 3:15 p.m., at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton. This hall is air-conditioned which makes dancing a pleasure during the summer.  Please check our caller/cuer schedule for July, August & September at www.eagerbeavers.info or see the OFN flyer.  You will see callers Daryl Clendenin and Darrell Kalmbach on the agenda.
