Beachcombers celebrated their 63rd birthday with an evening dance on June 27.  KC Curtis called and our own Cathy Houston cued the rounds.  They provided three hours of pure fun for the 4 squares of dancers.  We enjoyed dancing with all those who came from around the state to party with us!

Our next dance will be our annual Battle Rock Festival over Labor Day Weekend.   Leonard Snodgrass will be traveling down to the South Coast to call the weekend for us and Dave Cooper will be coming over the mountain to cue the rounds for us.  We will again be having the Friday night BBQ (don't forget to pre-register!), dancing in the surf, pie making, cider pressing, our fundraiser breakfast, Sunday night jamboree and lots of relaxing and catching up with old friends, so bring your RVs, book a motel or vacation home and plan on spending a fun weekend with us on the beautiful South Coast!
