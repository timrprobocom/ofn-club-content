Several club members traveled to Port Orford to help the Beachcombers celebrate their birthday and enjoyed the calling of K.C. Curtis and rounds cued by Cathy Houston. What a good dance!  Everyone stayed until the very end, which now days is quite unusual.

We are getting ready to start our new class on September 13. Advertising has begun and cards and flyers printed up to post and hand out.  We will be dancing in the July Jubilee Parade in North Bend and also plan on dancing at the Fun Fest Parade in Coos Bay in September. 

Our annual South Coast Area Picnic will be held on the third Sunday in August at Sturdivant Park in Coquille. It will be a potluck with hot dogs and hamburgers provided by the Area Council.  If you are in the area come by and join us.
