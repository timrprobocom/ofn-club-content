 R Square D dances are casual for June, July and August, on the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays.  Our dances were well attended in June, in spite of the heat.  We were very thankful for the fans.  June 10th was our M&M dance, and June 24th was our strawberry dance with lots of strawberry shortcake.  Several of our members hopped over to the Columbia River Dancers on June 27th.  Although there was a problem with the air conditioning, we all had a great time.
 August 12th will be our Hawaiian dance with Jim Raupp as guest caller. August 26th will be our Back To School dance. Please bring back to school supplies that will be donated to one of our local schools.  Both dances will be casual.
