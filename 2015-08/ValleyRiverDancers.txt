Valley River Dancers were the guests of the Toe Draggers on their annual mystery trip in June. The group danced on the steps of the Oregon State Capitol, entertained young women at Oak Creek Youth Correctional Facility in Albany, and enjoyed the hospitality of the Lebanon Square Circlers at their annual Strawberry Festival potluck and dance. We thank both clubs for their gracious hospitality and generosity. We had a blast. 

Congratulations to the Silver City Squares for capturing the Mid-Willamette Valley banner from us. Many clubs in the council competed for the honor, and we accept your challenge to win it back!

It's time! Friday, July 24, is our annual Dance Under the Stars. It will be held in Newberg on the tennis courts at the corner of Howard and 6th Streets. Pre-plus is at 7:30 and mainstream at 8:00 with Newberg's own Randy Dibble calling.  Julie Stiers will cue rounds. Please remember that the dancing surface will eat your good dance shoes; sneakers are recommended. 

Two parades filled our July dance card. Half the club turned out for the St. Paul Rodeo parade on Independence Day. We are also dancing in the Newberg Old Fashioned Festival Parade on July 25th. 

Our plus class graduated five dancers in July including a 12-year old, and we are proud of how well each of our students have mastered the moves. A-2 classes and workshops are continuing through the summer, and are now at 7:00 on Tuesdays. Drop-ins are welcome.
