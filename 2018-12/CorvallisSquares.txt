We had a festive and well-attended Halloween Dance on October 27. Our mainstream lessons are continuing under Bruce and Judy's excellent guidance. We look forward to the start of the Area New Dancers' Dances. We were dark in November in order to be able to attend other dances, so we are excited about December when we're holding our Christmas Dance and we're looking forward to dancing in the New Year! Wishing Happy Holidays to all! Karen
