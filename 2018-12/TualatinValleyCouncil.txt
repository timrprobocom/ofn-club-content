 On Saturday, October 6th the Hillsboro IOOF Hall was rocking with 136 dancers, setting a 2018 record for Anniversary Dance attendance.  The Sunset Promenaders 33rd Anniversary dance was indeed very good!  Mike Stout and Darrell Kalmbach called while Ken Pratt and Julie Stout cued a great dance.  The Promenaders went all out serving the dancers a ham dinner before the dance.  Ten TVC clubs were in attendance with many other visitors, one from Texas.
 On October 20th Mix â€˜N Mingle celebrated their 34th Anniversary with a full dance floor and lots of fun.  The River City Dancers from the PAC and the TVC Hoedowners were both awarded banners for their participation.  Randy Dibble and Jeanine Norden called and cued a spirited and fun dance.
