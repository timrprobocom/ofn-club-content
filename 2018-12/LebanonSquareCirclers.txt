Our club will have a busy month in December. The first is our Toy Dance and New Dancers Dance. Dancers may bring an unwrapped toy and get in to the dance for half price. The Lebanon Fire Department then picks up the toys for local distribution. Our dance on December 15 will be our Christmas dance. Our club also participates in the "Holiday In The Park" community decoration of Ralston Park. 
     
Hope to see you all at our 70th Birthday Dance on Sunday, January 20, 2019.   More details to follow. Marilyn York
