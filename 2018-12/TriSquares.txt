In October Tri Squares enjoyed making two visitations, to the Sunset Promenaders anniversary dance and to the Chaps & Petticoats where both our caller and cuer were headlining.  Also our Sunday afternoon Waltz and B-51 lessons continued very well.
 On November 4th we held a terrific “New Dancer Jamboree” with eight squares!  Thanks to everyone for your support!  On the tenth we’ll have a “Grateful Harvest Pie Party” dance, but on our second dance night, the day after Thanksgiving, we’ll be dark to allow for more family time for everyone.
 Our December dances begin on Saturday, the 8th, with our holiday dance, "Sounds of the Season" with Terry Halley and Sandra Pinion calling and cueing.  Then on Friday December 28th we will feature music from the Big Band era and the Forties at our "Snowflake Ball".  Our dances begin with rounds at 7:30 followed by plus at 7:45 until 8:00.  We then dance mainstream until 10:00 with refreshments served after the dance.
 In December we’ll have our club’s annual holiday dinner, this year at the Old Spaghetti Factory in Sherwood, again including our favorite white elephant gift exchange where some gifts seem to magically reappear from year to year.  Also our Waltz and B-51 lessons will be suspended until January.
