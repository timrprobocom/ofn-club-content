In October we had a pair of dances with great callersâ€”Jim Hattrick on the 2nd Friday and George Hermann on the 4th Friday.   Jackie Gale cued both of our dances as she normally does.  We are so lucky to have such great callers and a great cuer.  Both dances were well attended and had as many visitors as Single Trees in attendance.  Our Halloween dance had the usual turnout of zany costume wearers.  Thanks to all who participated and made the dance so much fun.  The 3rd Saturday Single Trees as well as Independence Wagon Wheelers and the Buckeroos helped the Whirl-A-Ways celebrate their 60th birthday!  It was sure fun to see a floor full of happy enthusiasts dancing to the calling of Mike Kious and his grandfather George Hermann.  Christina Corelli did a great job of cueing that night as always.  Thanks for a good time.

We are looking forward to our Christmas Dinner and Dance on December 14 half way through the month and always a fun affair as the hall is beautifully decorated all season long.  Everyone gets together on this one and makes the hall look magical and festive..

Hope to see many of you out dancing with us, but if not, Mid-Winter is around the corner.
