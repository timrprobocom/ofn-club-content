Classes are still going well.  We have a couple of dancers who are former dancers and are refreshing the activity and are having a ball. On Thursday, November 15, the class hosted their annual Thanksgiving Potluck. They will be doing the same thing on December 20 with their Christmas Potluck. It is free to all dancers.

Monday Plus class is going great. There is still room for one more week of new dancers to the class. Come on out from 630-830 for the class to refresh or learn. We have a great time. Phil is a lot of fun.

The next "Game Night" will be January 18. What a lot of fun we have. Some Friday night when we have "Game Night" you should join us.  It is a "Hoot." If you don't play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on, or, if there is some other game you would like to play, let us know. We are open to most any table game. The theme for the potluck in January will be "Mexican." That was the one that started the whole thing. Wow! What a great idea.

Wayne's Advanced class is from 6-730pm. The workshop is from 730-830 or so.

A lot of Stars when to Grants Pass to dance on Nov 3. There were enough of us present to retrieve a banner from the Charlie's. The November 17 Charlie Dance with Mike Sikorsky was well attended and, as usual, a lot of fun. Mike is always quite a showman and puts on a great dance.

Star thru, square thru,
See you in a Square
