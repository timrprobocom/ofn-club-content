Of course you are all coming to our annual Christmas Dinner December 17?  Again it will be at the Old Spaghetti Factory in Clackamas.

After losing four cuers in a quarter calendar year (Dorothy Lowder, Neva Reid Yvonne Clendenin and Cheryl Manley, we wonder how the dances will ever be the same.  But, most of our council members like the squares better, and not much emphasis is put on the rounds.  (Heck, our Ramblers club doesnâ€™t even have rounds.)  This differs from our surrounding councils, so they may be the ones feeling the pinch.  Still, if our council needs additional cuers, be sure we will be looking to out of council cuers. 

Speaking of Dorothy Lowder, she had quite the memorial Nov 4 at the Oak Grove Community Club.  It was fortunate that such a large venue was chosen, as any smaller would have been cramped.  There were mixed levels of rounds afterwards featuring music from her teaches and some of the dances she choreographed.  She was not well known within our council (although she lived within our council); she taught mostly within the Evergreen Council, but would do gigs here when asked.  She was known for her patience and teaching cues correctly, rather than the fast way, with simple styling emphasizing proper footwork and correct body positioning.
