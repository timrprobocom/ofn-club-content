 Our Mainstream dances in December are on Saturdays, the 1st and 15th.  The theme for both dances is Christmas and we also are having food drive too.  We want to be able to give a lot of non-perishable food to the Food Bank so they can give food to the less fortunate.  Our Mainstream caller is Mike Stout and cuer is Ken Pratt.
 Our December Plus dances are on Thursdays, the 6th and 20th with Darrell Kalmbach and Ken Pratt calling and cueing.
 All our dances start with Intermediate Rounds at 7:00 until 7:30, square dance with Rounds from 7:30 to 9:30 with a potluck break at the end.  We are located in Hillsboro upstairs on Mains Street and Third Street (267 E. Main St.).  We enjoy visits, please come visit us.
 We had another successful Seaside Sashay Festival this year with about 200 dancers attending.  We enjoyed the dancing and also the time visiting old and new friends.  The shopping and eating in Seaside is very good and we walked our legs off doing that.  There were about 80 prizes given and the split the pot was big both nights.  The weather was quite good with sunshine and a light breeze until Saturday night when it did shower several times.  As we drove home we noticed again that it is not that far to Seaside, and it is nice scenery along the way.
 We start our square dance lessons in January and we are working to get our advertisements organized and hopefully get some new students.  The last couple of years we have grown our membership and hope to continue that trend.  If you or any of your friends want to take lessons in January on Sunday afternoon from 4:00 until 6:00 at our hall which is the Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall. There is good parking on the street or in the bank parking lot across the street.
  If you have questions please call 503-848-3841 and we will try to answer them.
