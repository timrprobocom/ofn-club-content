Our Fall Mainstream Class is discovering why we love to square dance. The class members are making great progress under the guidance of George Hermann, our fantastic Club Caller and Mainstream Class Instructor, and they are having lots of fun in the process. We greatly appreciate Salem Hospital allowing us to hold our classes at the hospital.  Kudos to Dave O’Neil, IWW Membership chair, for a superb job of organizing and coordinating the fall lessons.

The November 3 Halloween Dance was a big success.  Everyone enjoyed the Halloween decorations, and many dancers added to the mood with imaginative costumes. Thanksgiving will have come and gone by the time you read this, and we will be entering the Christmas season. We hope that you had a Happy Thanksgiving and that your Christmas season is joyful and peace-filled.

 By all means don’t miss the December 8 Christmas Dance and Silent Auction. Enjoy spirited dancing, good fellowship, a festive holiday atmosphere, and a lively silent auction.  Bid on the many and varied items offered at the auction.  With skilled and well-timed bidding, and some luck, you may take home treasures that will enhance your holiday decorations, enrich your holiday entertaining, and/or complete your holiday gift shopping.

Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays at Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall, and especially be sure to come to our upcoming special dances:   December 8, Christmas Dance and Silent Auction; March 9, IWW Birthday Dance; April 13, Easter dance.  Hope to see you across a square! Happy holidays!  Dee and Bert Mackaman
