Beginning in November, the Hayshakers have a new Board of Directors with Craig Holt*, President; Nguyen Trung*, Vice-President; Dale Worthington, Secretary; Cynthia Weber, Treasurer; Ricia Parcher* and Helen Pitkanen-Herold*, Members at Large; and Kathy Worthington, Past-President [* - new to Board].  The Club wishes to thank Sylvia Davis for her many years of service.
  Also beginning in November, the Hayshakers will be dancing the 3rd and 5th Fridays of the month.  Many considerations were taken into account: availability of the Pacific Grange, the importation of callers and cuers, contra dance nights in Astoria, Vancouver & Portland, and the ability to visit Wave-Stepper and R-Square-D dances on a regular basis.  Mark Wheeler continues as our regular caller with Craig Abercrombie substituting from time to time.
 The 18th annual Seaside Sashay held in conjunction with the Sunset Promenaders at the end of October was a great success.  The Hayshakers would like to thank all the happy dancers who attended and those who helped behind the scenes.  Weâ€™ll do it again next year!
