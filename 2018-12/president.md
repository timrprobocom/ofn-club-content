As the holidays approach we will have many opportunities to have fellowship with family and friends. How about bringing family and friends square dancing with you?  They may have an enjoyable time watching and joining in on the fellowship of your square dance family.

Southern Oregon offers multiple dancing opportunities with a council dance November 30th, Charlie Brown Squares Birthday dance December 1st, and Star Promenaders New York New Year’s Eve Dance (celebrating New York time and get home early). The Rogue Sis Q Council is having a beginner Mainstream Pajamarama dance, that’s right come and dance in your best pajamas. What’s happening in your area?  I have seen several dancing opportunities at multiple Oregon clubs, councils, and beyond.  Search the OFN and the Federation Facebook sites and make plans to dance before, or after, that turkey, dressing, pies, cakes, and all those goodies.

The kids and I will be visiting Abernethy Grange November 24th to support a new cuer, Rikki Lobato, who will be working with an exciting, National caller, Hunter Keller, at Abernathy Grange.  Anyone want to join me and work off that Thanksgiving Dinner and DESSERT?  You have Friday to do you resting, shopping, and anything else after Thanksgiving Day and then Saturday go dancing.

Anyone having a Holiday dance or event I recommend sending flyers to your local OFN editor and get it posted to the Federation website and Facebook.  Tim Roberts has done a great job posting information from councils and club, and while you’re sending that email to Tim, send one to Kathy Roberts to post on the Federation Facebook page.

Don’t forget to invite a new dancer when attending dances. I must say a personal invitation may encourage someone to attend the dance.  It did for me this week.
