Scares and Squares 2018 is officially a wrap. Many stars aligned to create a wonderful dance weekend. We had to find a new venue this year, and the Oak Grove Community Club fit the bill perfectly. What a wonderful dance hall—our many out-of-town guests, and our callers, gave it rave reviews. Thanks to Bonnie and Eugene Ivy for their hard work maintaining this hall. It’s a real treasure. Every member of our club stepped up in some way to help put on this weekend. From Friday night’s trail-in dance featuring an array of picnic foods and autumnal delicacies, to Saturday’s costume contest (so many creative people!), to Sunday’s trail-out dance, we kept dancing and singing and moving to the grooving. We will square up again in 2019. Mark your calendars for October 25-27!

Our 10 students are making tremendous progress at our Wednesday lessons. They are looking forward to heading out to some new dancer jamborees. The Ramblers don’t sponsor a jamboree, but we encourage our students to attend those sponsored by other clubs.

All our monthly dances feature stupendous callers, but we have some real treats in store for you in the coming months—all at the Milwaukie Grange:

December 8: Diana Wedel, potluck at 6:30, alternating Mainstream and Plus from 7:30 to 9:30.

January 12: Stephen Cole, potluck at 6:30, alternating Mainstream and Plus from 7:30 to 9:30. This is our Black and White Dance, creative combinations of black and white are encouraged!

Here are the rules you need to know for Ramblers dances:
Casual attire encouraged. Wear what makes you feel comfortable.
Solo dancers warmly welcomed.
No round dancing—only squares.
Ramblers dances are high energy. You will get your steps in! 

We wish everyone happy holidays and hope to see you in a square!
