Did you know that nearly 3 squares of Happy Hoppers attended the Seaside Sashay at the end of October?  It may have been hard to count all of our members since many of them have dual club memberships and do not always wear their Hopper badges, but we were there having fun dancing and visiting with friends we  see only at events like the Sashay.  We sincerely appreciate the clubs who organize this great weekend.  Thank you!  We know it is a lot of work.

	One of the indisputable axioms of life is that things change over time, and so it is with the Hoppers as we settle in to our new home.  This year for the first time we will not be having a New Year’s Eve dance because our new hall is not available to us on that date.  While that part of our normal December activities has changed, others remain the same.  We will start the month on December 1st with a Christmas Toys Dance.  Each year we have collected toys for the Children’s Center at the last dance in November and at the first dance in December.  The Children’s Center is a non-profit organization that provides mental health care to children of low income families.  Our second dance, December 15th, fits the season perfectly with an all singing call dance and holiday treats for the break.   We will finish up the month with a visitation to the Country Cut-ups on December 29th.  We always have fun when we visit that lively group.

	This last year has been a year of transition for the Hoppers, but we are confident that we are now settled in to a new home and ready to make new memories and friends as we travel through the new year 2019.  We’re wishing all our square dancing friends and families a joyous holiday season and a wonderful 2019.
