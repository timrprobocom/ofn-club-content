Circle N Square held our Thanksgiving dance Saturday Nov 16. There were 2 squares, and even did a couple 6 couple tips. A big thanks to our Oregon dancers, and a visiting couple from the Redding area. A big thank you for supporting us as we were competing with a National Caller in Grants Pass. It's good to see Joel and Linda Helend back dancing. Annie Blaylock did a few line dances, which provides a nice change to our party nights. We hope she will continue this new twist to our party nights. We will hold our Christmas dance December 15, and want to invite everyone! We are looking into possibly starting another new dancer class in January, there has been reports of interest from people who were not able to start in September. The club has been, and will be going thru some changes with a possible changing of the guards as far as officers and other things. We have tentatively booked a caller for our Gold Diggers Dance 2019, look for fliers and more info.
Looking forward to the holidays, I feel a little guilty as I reflect on what has happened in our state this month. It hit home for me as my brother lost his home in the Camp fire. Please pray for all of the devastation and those who have been severely impacted by the fires and other tragedies in California.

Hope to see you soon
