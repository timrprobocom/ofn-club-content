 We made a fairly last minute decision to be dark for our 4th Friday October dance so some of our members could attend the Seaside Sashay weekend, which was great fun. 
 Our 4th Friday, November 23rd, dance is our annual Gospel Dance. Dan Nordbye will be guest calling and Julie Stiers will be cueing.
 Our New Dancer Christmas Dance will be 4th Friday, December 28th at Mainstream level.  Randy Dibble is the Caller and Julie Stiers is the Cuer.  Bring a wrapped $5 gift.  
 The next 5th Saturday ‘A’ Dance is December 29th, called by Randy Dibble, to be held at Woodburn Estates Country Club. 
 Monthly Round Dance Workshops, led by Ken and Dianne Pratt coming…. Beginning in January prior to our Plus Dance on 2nd Friday, (January 11th) starting at 6:30 p.m. for about 45 minutes (stay tuned).
 Beginning in January we have new cuers.  Our 2nd Friday Plus Dance will be cued by Ken and Dianne Pratt and include some intermediate rounds.  Our 4th Friday Mainstream Dance will be cued by Sherri Clark.
