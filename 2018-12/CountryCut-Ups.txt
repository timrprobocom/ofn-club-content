Happy Holidays! We are celebrating our club Christmas party on December 15th for club members only. We will enjoy a great meal together, be entertained, and exchange gifts. This is a great time for members to mix and mingle and get to know one another.

We are also very thankful this year for a roof that doesn’t leak and a great turn out for our annual breakfast. The breakfast and bazaar was a big success this year, so our taxes and insurance are paid up! Thanks to all of you who came out and supported us. Next big project is the annual Barn Sale on April  12 and 13, 2019. Mark your calendars!

Come join us for our 5th Saturday dance on December 29th with Jim Hattrick calling and cueing.  These all plus dances are a lot of fun, so come on out for a delightful evening on a cold winter’s night!
