  December has arrived in the beautiful Northwest.  It has snow, rain, hail, and hot square dancing.  The Columbia River Dancers, just recovering from our Burn-Off, will start the Christmas Season with Craig and Molly Combs doing our calling and cueing on December 8th.
 Our Christmas dance on December 22nd will feature our own Jim Hattrick calling and cueing.  What a great way to get ready for Santa.  Jim's smooth and yet challenging way makes for a great time.
 My granddaughter says one of the reasons she enjoys square dancing is that you can do it to almost any kind of music.  It will be interesting to see what these two callers come up with this wintery season.  Come join us.  We dance plus from 7 to 8 and mainstream from 8 pm on.  We have the reputation that everyone gets to dance so if you are a single, we welcome you.
 If you are looking for a place to bring in the new year, look no farther that the Hazel Dell Grange.  Jim Hattrick and Adam Christman will be there along with the CRDancers.  Watch for more information on our website.
