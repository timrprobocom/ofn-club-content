 Our 34th Birthday Dance has come and gone amidst much dancing, laughter, and fellowship.  
 Lindie put up the decorations her mother had made for us long years ago, along with more recent club banners.  Her mother made pillows shaped like individual M'nMs and long ones to resemble packets of M'nMs.
 Instead of filling jars with M&Ms for people to guess the total, she put little packets of different kinds of M&Ms into the jars to make figuring the number in each jar more difficult to calculate.  Some people had it down to a science the original way.  Nobody was allowed to win more than one prize.
 The dance floor was festive with all the dancers.  Hoedowners and River City Dancers each had enough club members to take home a banner for us to retrieve at a later date.  We also welcomed dancers from the Tualatin Valley Council.  Randy Dibble called mainstream for the event, and Jeanine Norden cued popular rounds.
 The evening ended downstairs with ice cream and chocolate cake and more laughter and fellowship.  
 Please bring items for the Canned Food Dance to our December 15th dance (or before if you can't make it to that dance.)
