We had a Spaghetti dance and a Veterans dance recently both were sparsely attended. We really hope that we can get more dancers to attend our dances or another club might go away.

We along with Single Trees and Whirl-A-Ways are sponsoring lessons that are doing very well. We started out with about 25 and still have about 19 attending. Hopefully some of those will join the local clubs and help all of us grow into more viable clubs.

Let's all try attending and supporting our clubs and help this activity become stronger again.
