Our next scheduled Fifth Saturday Dance, December 29, has been cancelled because it's two days away from the New Year's Eve dance.  

Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli will be calling and cueing a New Year's Eve dance.  8:30 will be Pre-Rounds with Christina.  Then we'll dance mainstream with plus tips and rounds until 2019!  Roger will call one tip into the new year.  Wow!  Can you believe it'll be 2019?   Hard to believe!  Any callers or cuers present New Year Eve will be asked if they'd like to call and/or cue.  Sounds like a fun way to bring in 2019!  Please join us as we celebrate each time zone's midnight into 2019!  It's fun as Roger was raised in Chicago.  We'll do New York, Chicago, Ontario, Oregon and then Eugene/Springfield.  We party all night. The cost for this evening of FUN is back to the 80's!  $2.50 per person!  That's right!  $2.50!  Please bring a pie.  We'll celebrate at midnight with more noise makers and sparkling cider.

Keep on dancing, calling and cueing for FUN
