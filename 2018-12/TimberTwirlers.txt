We are moving right along with our class this year and hopefully they will join our club. Like many clubs we are getting smaller and really need an influx of new dancers.

Our new dancers dance will be Sunday, December 2 at the Salem Square Dance Center at 1:30. Look for our flyer.

We always try to have interesting themes for our dances and invite all to come and join us. Casual attire is always an option at our club. Sandy Harris
