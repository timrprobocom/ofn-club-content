Toes had a great Pink Dance to support cancer research.  We got the party started with 3 lively "little" ladies dancing a skit to "Trashy Women" and then a special treat, a set of robust calls from Jonny Roberts (Kathy & Tim's son) and KC that ultimately blew the fuse in the speakers to end a great dance.  Toe's raised over $1,600 for the Knight Cancer Institute at OHSU.
 December 7th will be our "Old Fashion Christmas" dance, bring a can or 2 of food for the food bank.  December 21st will be our "The Night Before Christmas" dance.  Both dances will feature our great caller KC and (Linda) and our wonderful Bev and (Harlan) cueing.
 Please come and dance with us, we love visitors.
