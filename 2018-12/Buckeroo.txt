Leaves are falling and temperatures have dropped here in the Umpqua Valley; however, we are enjoying the season as we prepare for the coming holidays. Here at the barn we are prepping for one of our biggest fundraisers of the year…our wreath sale. Check out our website for more information and order your wreath in time to enjoy it for the whole season.
We had a great time dancing in the Veteran’s Day Parade here in Roseburg. We always enjoy celebrating those who have sacrificed for our country. We are lucky to have the Umpqua Area Council support this event each year.
We had a blast at our Harvest Dance in November. The club provided a turkey and we all brought side dishes to share. The best part of this dance is that we have a student level dance prior to the mainstream dance. This is often the first time the students get a chance to dance in a real dance setting. It is fun to see them on the dance floor having a great time.
Our craft bazaar is coming up soon. Check out our website for more information and let us know if you are interested in joining us and setting up a table. I hear we may have a jolly visitor joining us!
Remember that we love visitors and are only a short drive on I5! We hope to see you and your family in square this holiday season!

Happy dancing,
Robin Faltersack
