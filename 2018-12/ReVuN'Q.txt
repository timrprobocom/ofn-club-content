The lessons continue to go well with good attendance for both classes. Cha is working into Phase 4 moves and West Coast Swing is working toward the end of Phase 4 and into easy Phase 5. The dancers are enjoying the teachings of Ken & Dianne Pratt and Stephanie Lozano with Leonard Snodgrass. Leonard is getting better weekly with his cueing. The switch-off between the two couples from one week to another is a challenge for all concerned, but it is working. Thanks to all four instructors for their work in making our club a place for current Phase 2 dancers to work into the next level of rhythms.

We are not hosting New Yearâ€™s Eve this year, but our instructor, Ken Pratt along with David Vomocil, are hosting an outrageously fun evening. (Their description!)
Come and see us from 8 pm to midnight for a nice evening of dancing, camaraderie, and desserts to keep our energy up for the fun evening. We will be dancing at the Salem Square Dance Center, so plan on joining us.

We will hold a club meeting soon to discuss the upcoming season of dancing and see what is next for lessons and see how things are going for the instructors. Marilyn Schmit
