We had such fun at our Halloween Dance! Most of the dancers came in costumes. Our cuer, Sandra Pinion, came as Maleficent- a great costume! Leonard Snodgrass, our caller, was not costumed so several of the members decided to make a mummy of him. He graciously stood very still while having toilet paper wound all around him! What a fun trick! And we earned our Mummy badge. Carmen
