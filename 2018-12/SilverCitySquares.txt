We had our ham dinner dance on November 9. Those who joined us enjoyed a great dinner followed by dancing to Leonard and Frances.

We are looking forward to a switch for us in December. We have our regular dance on December 14 and our new dancers dance on December 29. On the 14, we will also be having a basket raffle. This was started by a challenge from one club member to the other members. Our new dancer dance is also our baked potato dinner so when you bring your students, bring them early and enjoy dinner as well. Our experienced clothing will also be 1/2 price at our new dancer dance. See our flyers for both of these dances.

Mom (Karyn Buchheit) has a definite place for the teen festival. It will be at Silverton High School, Silverton Oregon again! Dates are May 3 & 4, 2019. Mark your calendars and come watch the fun. There are lots of volunteer jobs so contact mom if you are interested in helping out. See you at a dance soon. Petrina Buchheit
