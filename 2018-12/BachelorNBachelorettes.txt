I hope we can have more fast dances like our Oct 3 dance.  Craig Abercrombie had us going so fast my petticoat spun around me making a complete circle.  Maybe I should have tied it tighter, but at least it didn’t drop to the floor!

How did you like the elections?  Our club lobbyist, Gerry Mander, has been sitting in Senator Phillip Buster’s office all day, hoping to see the senator for a state mandate about having square dances every night of the week, sort of like Henry Ford did in his company towns.  But so far no luck.

Our New Dancer’s Jamboree will be Dec 12.  Come join us for a B-51 dance.  See our flyer in this magazine!

As a matter of fact, come visit us any Wednesday night.  We have different callers and cuers each night (see our schedule in this magazine).  In the words of our President, “We hire ‘em and fire ‘em so fast their heads spin!”  -- Sort of like my petticoat I guess.
