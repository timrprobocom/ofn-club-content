Hi Everyone,
Again & again, don't forget the "Game Basket" to benefit the next "Young at Heart" Dance. This dance will be next July. The precise date and place has yet to be decided. If you have any games or puzzles to donate to this basket, let Lorri or Lois know. All proceeds will go to the "Young at Heart" or Youth Dance. Lorri will have this basket at all the dances she attends, so you can purchase raffle tickets.

The Rogue Sis-Q Council has taken sponsorship of the "Pajamarama" on January 11, 2019. This will become an annual "New Dancer" dance. The Callers & Cuers sponsor "New Dancer" dances in December and February, so this should be an excellent fit and give the newbies one more arena to practice their newly learned skill. We are also thinking about sponsoring a few more "New Dancer" dances for the students. They need all the help they can get, as we all did at this stage of our learning.

The 5th Friday Council Dance will be on November 30th in Medford. Advanced is 630-730; pre-rounds 730 and MS/Plus 8-1030. The Caller is Lawrence Johnstone & Cuer is Rikki Lobato.

There are lots of "Holiday" dances and get-together's going on, so try to attend as many as possible and share the "Holiday Spirit" with all you meet.

Happy Holidays!!!

The next Council meeting will be December 4, 2018 at Round Table Pizza in Poplar Square.

Lois & Lorri
