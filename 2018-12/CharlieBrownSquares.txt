The Charlie's have a great class going with 8 students who seem to really be enjoying themselves. We had a special guest instructor on November 8th - Richard Lane came down to teach class while our instructor Chuck Simpkins was out of town.  The two dances in November were great fun!!! J Domis always brings dancers out and we had Mike Sikorsky & Cathy Houston on Nov 17!! We had 5 squares for Nov 17th dance. If you missed either dance - you truly missed a great time!!

December 1st is the Charlie Brown Squares 51st Birthday dance with the fabulous Michael Kellogg & MaryAnn Callahan!!! This is definitely one to come visit for - these are two of the best talents!!!!  6pm Advanced 730 Pre Rounds & 8-1030 MS/Plus tips & rounds.  Dec 15th we will have Phil Ramey and Elaine Funk doing our Christmas Cookie Exchange dance.  Will be lots of fun.

The Boatnik Committee is busy planning and looking forward to our 2019 Festival Memorial weekend with Joe Saltel & TJ (Bruce) Chadd - both are wonderful. Plan to come down!!

We hope everyone has a wonderful holiday season surrounded by friends and family!! We would love to see you in a square this year!!
