Willamette Squares celebrated their 24 years as a club at their regularly scheduled dance for the month of October. It was Halloween themed with costumes encouraged. Each corner of the Square Dance Center held some kind of Halloween creature, and there was an assortment of orange and black outfits, one gun less cowboy, two skeletons that literally had each other’s back, and our caller, Sandy, as Super girl! There were a variety of comments made referring to Supergirl’s shapely dancer’s legs which were complemented by her colorful stockings. There was no shortage of treats (no tricks) along with the Willamette Squares birthday cake. Thanks to everyone who attended and to all whose efforts contributed to the lively birthday dance.
Willamette Squares was honored to have Bryce and Nancy Baker among us again. They received acknowledgement and a good share of hugs. Healing thoughts are being sent to Diane Wilke, who is recovering from heart surgery.
Willamette Squares will be having a Christmas Dance in December on their regularly scheduled dance night at the Salem Square dance Center. Their new Dancers Dance with be January 16, 2019, and on the fourth Saturday of January they will be dark due to the Mid Winter Festival that weekend. They continue to support the Independence Wagon Wheelers free Sunday night lessons at Salem Hospital. Willamette Squares are off to a good start for their 24th year. Jodee Howard via Steve Hoots
