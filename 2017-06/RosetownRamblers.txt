The Ramblers have been too busy to submit items for the OFN for the last several months, so this month we will make up for past omissions.

We elected our Board at our annual membership meeting in April:

President: Jeff Knapp
Secretary: Tiffany Naemura
Treasurer: Clint Maurice
Member at Large: Tara O’Neil
Member at Large: Jim Pettycrew
Class Representative: Dave Tedd

After the hard work of conducting club business, we got down to the real business of dancing. Stephen Cole—rescheduled from January snow to April showers—called our Black and White Dance. We were thrilled to host visitors from BnBs, Valley Squares, Chaps and Petticoats, and Floor Dusters. Almost everyone got into the spirit and looked splendid in many different variations of the black and white theme.

We are delighted to announce that we won the Trophy Dance hosted by Tualatin Timber Squares on April 26, since we were the club with the highest percentage attendance. TTS sure knows how to throw a party—they hosted close to 90 dancers and provided wonderful refreshments, clever decorations, and warm hospitality. It was a night we won’t soon forget. In fact, we are still having sweet dreams about the magnificent chocolate coconut cake prepared by Kathy Roberts — superb!

Because we won the trophy in April, it is now our turn to host a trophy dance. We are honored and excited to announce a Trophy Dance on Saturday, June 10, 2017 at the Milwaukie Grange with dynamic Don Wood calling. We invite one and all to enjoy Rambler conviviality—starting with dinner provided by our club members at 6:30 pm. We will dance from 7:30 to 9:30, alternating Mainstream and Plus tips. Our theme for the evening will be Over the Rainbow—dazzle us with your most vibrant hues. We enthusiastically welcome all dancers—including young, old, in-between, solo, and partnered. Look for a flyer in this edition of the OFN!

SYIAS!
