Willamette Squares enjoyed its Maypole dance. By moving over and under in opposite directions of each other, the dancers wove colorful ribbons around the maypole. Each year as we gain experience, it goes more smoothly and is always fun as we welcome the month of May into our new year with the promise of spring.

We continue with our monthly dances on the 4th Saturday of each month. We are proud to report that we have eight graduates from the round dancing waltz class. We continue to support the upcoming summer festival by participating as dancers or volunteering and are looking forward to it. Big or small, we always enjoy our dances and extend a hearty welcome to anyone who wishes to attend.
