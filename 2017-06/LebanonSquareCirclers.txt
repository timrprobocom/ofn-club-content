April was a busy month for our club with dances on the first and third Saturday nights.   On April 29, we went on our "Super Mysterious" Mystery Trip. Our bus left Lebanon at 5:45 PM, picked up dancers in Albany and Salem; then headed EAST. That really surprised everyone. No one guessed our final destination. The Capitol Callers and Cuers Association sponsored this special dance at the Lyons Grange. Calling for the evening were Bruce Lowther, Leonard Snodgrass, and Charlotte Jeskey. Cueing were Judy Russell, Stephanie Lozano, Jackie Gale, and Ralph Lambert. It was a fabulous dance. There was lots of singing both going and coming back under the direction of Barb Schafer. Many thanks must be given to Frank Cawrse and his crew for their "Super Planning".  
 
The next Lebanon dance will be our Taco Dance with Bill Jeskey the Chef. Charlotte Jeskey will be calling and Jackie Gale cueing.   

Preparations for our STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL WEEKEND are in full swing and great items for the Silent Auction are being obtained. The major project is the building of our new trailer for the big parade on Saturday morning of the festival. The main trailer frame was contributed by John and Wanda Frenzel. Other items were contributed and many members have been gathering on Saturday mornings to complete the project. The weekend will be filled with dancing, potlucks, a parade, our experienced clothing sale,  and lots of fun. Strawberry shortcake will be served on Saturday night. Please mark your calendar and come join us for this glorious weekend. See you in a square!
