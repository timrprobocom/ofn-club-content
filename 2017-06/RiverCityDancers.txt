Like all Oregon State Square Dance Clubs, River City dancers are holding important business meetings in June.  There’s a new roster of officers, a bylaws change, and discussion about our future caller selection to be held this November.  Thanks again to Tami Helms and Tim Keck for staying with us!  

For those who have been curious about my health status, my Kaiser doctors are trying to get my atrial fibrillation (I call it “afib” for short) under control.  Now they have me on some pretty heavy duty meds, which leave me exhausted even before I try to do anything.  When I complain that my blood pressure is too low, they say something like, “you’ll get used to it”, but I’m not.  So for all those ladies who are gracious enough to give my partner, Rocky, a dance tip, “THANK YOU!”.  I can get through a couple of rounds, but I don’t like to square up unless the call is “short and sweet”.  As for myself, I plaintively whimper, “but I’ve got to have some blood pressure, and when both numbers are below a hundred, I might feel terrible!”.

Nevertheless, we’re looking forward to Summer Festival in Salem.  Hope to get lots of hugs for Rocky and I!
