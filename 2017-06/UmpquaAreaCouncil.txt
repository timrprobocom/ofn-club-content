What a fun and lively Cinco de Mayo Federation dance we had at the Barn
May 6th.   The Barn was hopping with ten squares of dancers and it was great
to dance with so many out of town friends, delegates and board members. 
We had a full taco bar, door prizes and an energetic caller and a great cuer.
What could be more fun than that?  Summer is just around the corner and
as you make plans for fun things to do think about doing in August,  add coming to Roseburg
and dancing with us at the Douglas Fair to your list.  We dance in the evenings
7:00 – 9:00 pm.  The fair dates for this year are August 9-12th and it’s super fun
to wear your square dance finery and dance under the stars with the sounds
of midway in the background.
