The cha lessons continue during May with the phase 3 steps completed and the introduction of phase 4 steps and floor time. We have a good group of students taking the class. Julia Buchheit is one of the students and she is competing in cueing at the teen competition in Canada. She got some stage time and cued her song from memory for the group in attendance before they left.
Cheryl has put together some plans for the fall season that will be shared soon for those who are interested in joining us. Keep in touch with us to see what is coming.
Summer is almost upon us and some will be gone at various times for conventions, family time, etc. Jeanine Norden will be our guest cuer for June 1. Come and enjoy her cueing and let her know we appreciate her coming down from Portland.
