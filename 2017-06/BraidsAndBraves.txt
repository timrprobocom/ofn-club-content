 We had a great Taco Dinner before our April dance. It's always a great evening when the Braids and Braids get together, even when it's just us. Our caller, Leonard Snodgrass, challenged us on the dance floor with some unusual patterns and guided us through the wrinkles with lots of laughter. He has a great variety of music, too. Sandra also kept the round dancers on their toes with her lively selections. Another great Braid and Braves dance. Visitors are always welcome. 
We will be dancing through June and will be dark for July (Summer Festival) and August. We are planning a club campout/picnic for the last part of June.
