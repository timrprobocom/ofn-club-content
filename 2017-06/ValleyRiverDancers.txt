We held our annual meeting and new officers were elected. Thank you to our dancers who stepped up and are willing to serve their club for the next year:  President, Steve Zimmerman; Vice-President, Teija Danskey; Treasurer, Stan Danskey; Secretary, Jan Amerson. 
 We have some great dances planned and are looking forward to having Dan Nordbye calling with Randy Dibble at our dance on June 29.  Hope you will all come and join us.  We have also decided to increase our door to $6.00 per person, $3.00 for Youth (under the age of 18) and Family $15.00 (2 Adults and children under the age of 18).  Hope to see you all in a square real soon.
