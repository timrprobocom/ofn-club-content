On April 29th the TVC hosted a Spring Fling dance at the Aloha Grange. There were nearly 10 squares of dancers enjoying the calling of Mike Stout and cueing of Julie Stout.  We all had a wonderful time. The Hayshakers claimed the TVC banner by having the highest percentage of their club present. 
 The Council has elected officers for the upcoming year with President Dale Brabham, Secretary Andis Geruts, and State Delegate Jim Rogers continuing their roles from last year.  Our new Treasurer is Joanne Switzer.  The new Alternate State Delegate will be Mary Schneider who is also the PAC Delegate. Outgoing officers are VP Kathy Roberts who is becoming the Oregon State Federation President, and Treasurer Carolene Siebert. Thank you for your dedication. 
 The Council voted to cast a vote in favor of the Background Check Recommendations proposal as presented at the Federation Meeting in January.
Our next Council event will be a 5th Saturday “Round Dance Party” at the IOOF Hall on July 29th, 2017.  Ken Pratt will be the Cuer MC.
