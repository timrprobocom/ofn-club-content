Spring has brought beautiful weather here to the Umpqua Valley! Spring has also brought elections to many clubs around Oregon. As new members step up to help with leadership roles, it is important to remember those who came before. Our clubs could not continue without people who are willing to spend their most valuable resource of all, time.  I know there are clubs that often have to beg for someone to step up, but this year at the Buckeroos Barn we were lucky enough to have two members who want to lead as our president. We will be welcoming Bruce Knotts as our president in the coming weeks.
I want to give a personal THANK YOU to Doris Koozer who has been our fearless leader for past four years. She has spent countless hours helping to get our club on solid ground. Under her leadership, membership has increased and national callers are again making their way to the Buckeroo Barn. In my humble opinion, the Buckeroo Barn is one of the best dance halls in the state. If you have not joined us for a dance recently, you should!
Our annual Buckeroo Round Up is June 9-11, 2017. The Buckeroo Round Up is a great event and a fun way to start off the summer festival season.  This year we have Dan Nordbye calling and Mary Ann Callahan cuing. As part of the Buckeroo Round Up this year, we will also be having a benefit dance at the Wildlife Safari.  Check out our website or the flyers  and then plan to join us!
Our regular dances are on the first and third Saturdays of each month. We have recently installed two swamp coolers to keep us dancing all summer long! We would love to see in a square!

Happy dancing,
Robin Faltersack
