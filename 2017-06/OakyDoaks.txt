In April, a few of the Oaky Doaks got together and spent a weekend in Lincoln City wandering through the city wide yard / garage sales, having a pot luck, play games and, of course, square dancing. One of the places that we danced at was the Drift Creek Covered Bridge. The rainy weather was nice enough to give us a long enough break to dance a couple tips there.

The month of May found the Oaky Doaks experiencing happy and sad times. On the May 6th we celebrated 57 years of dancing to the calling of George Herman and cuing of Patty Herman. It also found us saying good-bye and farewell to our club caller / cuer couple Mike and Helen Halley on May 20th with the British Invasion dance being their last one with us. We were also on the road for a club visitation on May 13th to the River City Dancers. 

Who wears short shorts? Come join the Oaky Doaks on Saturday, June 3rd, at our Shorts and Shortcakes dance to find out. Dance to the calling of Bruce Lowther and cueing of Molly Combs before heading off to enjoy delicious berry shortcakes during the break. 

Calling all Parrot heads! It’s a big Jamaica Mistaica if on Saturday, June 17th, you don’t travel with the Oaky Doaks who will be heading to Margaritaville.  We will be dancing to the music of Jimmy Buffett called by Mark Wheeler and cued by Molly Combs. Tropical attire admired but not required. Take a break and join us at the “bar” for virgin Margaritas and possible cheeseburgers in paradise.
 
June 30th members of the Oaky Doaks will be attending the Portland Area Council’s Fifth Friday Dance. They invite members of the other PAC clubs and other councils to square dance to Darrell Kalmbach and round dance to Tami Helms. Check the PAC flier for times and location.
