Come join the Tumbleweeds on June 16 to help us celebrate our long time member, Dell Uptegrove's, 100th Birthday. He is still dancing. An amazing guy, whom we all love. Guest caller will be Mike Halley. Cuers will be Tami Helms/Doug Hatch. Lunch will follow the dance! Of course, we would like to see you at all our dances.
