Thanks to all of you who came to our Black Light Dance and helped us have fun in the spooky atmosphere at the end of April. Scott Zinser, dressed in all white so we could see him, did a great job of keeping us straight in the squares. The dancers donned there white gloves and tried to figure out who they were dancing with. Everyone seemed to have a fun time!

June will bring our special Fatherâ€™s Day dance with Dan Nordbye and Julie Stiers. Take a break from the family, and dance with us at the Boring Barn on Sunday afternoon on May 18th. We will start with an hour of Plus and then go to Mainstream, with every 3rd tip Plus. Dan is a great caller and if you have heard him, you know that. If you have not heard him, come check out a National Caller worth a few extra dollars to hear. Julie is a great cuer and also fun to dance with. See our flyer for all the details.

We dance all summer long, so come out and have fun with the Country Cut-Ups on the 1st and 4th Saturdays of the month. We will be having another 5th Saturday dance in July, so stay tuned for that event.
