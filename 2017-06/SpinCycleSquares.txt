The Dan Nordbye dance in April was a big success. The dancers were delighted with Dan's calling. He comes to our area each year, and his calling just gets better and better. His program is upbeat and a challenge while remaining FUN! We look forward to his return to Oregon. Actually he'll be at the Buckeroo Barn the second weekend in June. 

Ian Craig called advanced, mainstream and plus recently for our Spring Fling dance.  Ian had serious heart issues recently, but that surely didn't deter him. Wow!  A really fun program. The potluck was awesome, as always. The dancers enjoyed the Sunday dance. We're so glad Ian pulled through and was with us. 

We are dark May 28th, for the Memorial Day weekend. We dance Sundays at 5:30 pm. Come and join us for some FUN floor time. Check the When and Where for any dark dates. Dark dates for us are few, but they do happen from time to time. We love visitors!

Happy dancing!
