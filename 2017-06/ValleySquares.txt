On Wednesday April 26th, several members went to the Winona Grange in Tualatin to attend the Tualatin Timber Squares' Trifecta dance.  "Trifecta" because it multi-tasked three dances:  Their First Anniversary, the Trophy Dance, and their New Dancer Jamboree.  Janienne Alexander was assisted by several guest callers and we all had a great time.
 Craig Abercrombie will be calling our Strawberry Dance on June 3rd with Connie Clark cueing.  We have changed our dance format to Mainstream with every third tip Plus and rounds from 7 to 10 p.m.  Open break with refreshments starting at 8 p.m.  Please see the flyers below.
