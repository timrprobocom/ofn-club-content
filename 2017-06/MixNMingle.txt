It's that time of year again.  Our election brought some new candidates for the board.  Dan Knierim will continue as president, Patty Bonney remains as vice president, and Lindie Noonan stays on as treasurer.
 The changes are Sue Naven taking over as secretary, and Robin Faltersack as our new member-at-large, who will also be our TVC delegate.  Rick Faltersack will be our other TVC delegate.  Thanks to all who stepped up to the plate to see us through another year.  
  Patty Bonney
