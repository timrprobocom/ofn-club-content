We WON!! We WON!! We WON!! We were at the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival May 5-7. We won first place in Junior Squares. Thomas and Julia won third place in Basic B Rounds. Julia won first place in Novice Cueing. We tied with the Wesburn Wranglers for the Promotion Award.
Mom (Karyn Buchheit) brought home all the co-ordinator supplies for next year. She now has to go through everything and start work on the next Teen Festival. She does have the badges for next year and is getting them ready to be given to the participating teams/clubs at the June Teen Festival Committee meeting. She hopes to have the location for next yearâ€™s Teen Festival confirmed by the end of this month.

Thank you to everyone who attended our Spaghetti Dinner dance in May. We had a lot of fun as well as a good dinner. We also had our trophies out on display. Mom now has to get them engraved! 

 We will be dark June, July and August. However, our youth are running the concession stand at Summer Festival so we hope to see you there. You can purchase Teen Festival pins for next year at that time!!
