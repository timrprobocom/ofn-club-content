 The Club had a visitation to the Eager Beavers Anniversary Dance and it was a lot of fun.
 Also, we had a visitation to the Valley Squares Anniversary Dance and it was a very good time too.
 We finished the dance classes at the end of May and have a nice bunch of new dancers to dance with; so come welcome them to Mainstream square dancing and meet and make new friends.
