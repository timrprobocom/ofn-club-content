Mike Stout will call the Hawaiian Dance Saturday, June 10th, with Hawaiian dancing by cuer Julie Stout.
 All the club’s dances are held at Garibaldi City Hall (107 6th Street—at Acacia).  About two-thirds of the building’s second floor is a dance floor, built in the 1940s by the Fire Department for the old Firemen’s Balls.
 Free square dance classes continue on the dance floor at the Tillamook Elks lodge, 1907 Third Street in downtown Tillamook.  The classes are taught by club caller Joe Wrabek.
