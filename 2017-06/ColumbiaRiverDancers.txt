The song says, "June is busting out all over."  Well, Maybe we should forget that April and so far in May it is acting like it was still winter.  I have been assured that better weather is ahead.  The Hazel Dell Grange can get warm but the CRDs have big fans that help to keep it cool.  We will not be dark this summer.  Those dances, by the way, are on the 10th and 24th of June with Craig Abercrombie calling and cueing both dates.
 Our lessons are doing well and will continue through the summer with a beginner's class on the first Tuesday of the month at 7 PM.  The mainstream class begins at 8:30.  Jim Hattrick will be teaching the classes.  Jim has the philosophy to teach to the level of the class.  That is, he moves the class along at a pace that insures the classes learn the moves, stay actively engaged and have fun dancing to what they know.  Oh, yeah, we have round dance lessons from 6-7.  Jim is teaching waltz in May but I have no idea what will be in June.  Come out and see.
 If your club goes dark and you are interested in keeping or improving your skill level, join us for the classes or our Saturday dances.  We dance plus level from 7 to 8 and mainstream from 8-9:30 or 10.  Our idea is for every one to dance so if you are a single, come on out.
 See you in a square.
