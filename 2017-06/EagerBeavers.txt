April was a busy month with our weekly dances, classes, and our Anniversary Dance.  Hope you had a tax refund and the Spring Cleaning is a breeze.  Our three callers and cuers for our Anniversary Dance did an amazing job. The eighty-five attendees including some callers and cuers not only had a good time dancing they also enjoyed a great chicken dinner.  All of this was made possible by the many club members who came early and stayed late to make sure all went smoothly.  We appreciate your good work, and a special thank you to those who chaired the event; Karen, Sally, Mike & Ferrous.  Thank you all.
 NOTE:  We will dance at the Aloha Grange on the following Mondays:  Memorial Day on May 29th, and June 26th as the Church is hosting their annual Kids Day Camp.
 Ask Kay Roger about reservations for our Beach Retreat in October.  It is not too early.   
 Officers elected for the coming year are the following: Chief Dam Builder - Karen and Ferrous Steinka; Assistant Dam Builder - Sally and Mike Duyck; Log Thumper - Judy Martin; Gnawer - Marie Clem; TVC Delegate - Ken Marifke.  Kay Rogers will remain for her second year as TVC delegate.  They were installed by Dave Pebworth at the May club meeting.
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 to 3:00 pm, at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
