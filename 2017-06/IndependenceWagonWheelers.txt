On the weekend of April 22 approximately 50 of our members (about ½ of the club) spent the weekend at Yachats for our annual Koast Krash.  Attendance at this function is one of the many benefits of being a member of the Independence Wagon Wheelers. Each year several members volunteer to chair this function and this year it was George and Patty Hermann, Gene and Bonnie Ivey, Ron and Neta Minten and Dave and Theresa O’Neill. The theme of the “Wizard of Oz” was picked for this year and everyone was encouraged to come in costume based on the theme. Most of the characters from the Wizard of Oz were represented, including the flying monkeys (they didn’t really fly!), but best of all was the apple tree. Plans for next year will soon be underway so if you would like to enjoy a wonderful weekend at Yachats next spring all you have to do is become a member of our club and have a great time.
Happy Dancing.
