Greetings from the Buzzin' Bees. As I write this (in May) we are down to two dances left in this Dance season. Hard to believe. Our final dance has a red white and blue theme and it is on June 3rd at the Hazel Dell Grange. Our Guest cuer will be Lonnie Syks. Our caller is the harmonica playing K.C Curtis. Pre-rounds start at 7:30 and squares start at 8 p.m.

The Bees have several things on their summer agenda. We plan a picnic on July 15th at Bill and Linda Lundin's home. Burgers and hotdogs provided. Bring a side dish or dessert to share. We also plan a campout August 11th through the 13th. Visitations are also on the agenda this summer. Come visit us for our final dance before it gets too hot to dance at the Grange. Hope to see you in a square.
