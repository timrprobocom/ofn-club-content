<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Having returned from a successful weekend for Federation meeting in Roseburg, it is now time to sit down and put thoughts in writing for the next issue of the Oregon Federation News.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, congratulations to the Oregon youth who went to Langley, British Columbia and competed in the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival. After missing first place by less than half a point last year, they came home with all sorts of hardware representing their First Place in the Junior Division. Julia Buchheit cued at the Festival and she came home with a First Place trophy and her brother, Thomas, and Julia, did a round dance and came home with a third place trophy. I want to say thank you to all the callers, cuers, parents, and guardians who support their children to have a wonderful experience at the Festival each year. There is lots of practice and time away from home prior to the Festival, so these awards are much deserved. Remember, that the Festival is in Silverton, Oregon next May. Please support them in any way you can. Help at the Festival, support monetarily, and, of course, dance with them when they visit.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New officers of the Federation were revealed at the Federation meeting. They will be installed at the Federation meeting in September in Tigard at the Kinton Grange. Won&rsquo;t you consider attending and see Kathy Roberts installed as the new President. It is sure to be an exciting event with her closest friends doing the installation. I am sure we will get a good laugh out of it.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Summer time means that some clubs go dark. Look in the OFN to see who is dancing this summer and keep dancing. Take your new dancers with you so they don&rsquo;t forget what they learned in class and will be ready to attend the fall classes and pick up a few more hints to keep dancing. If you know when some classes start, you can start recruiting and get more dancers for the fall classes.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Summer Festival is just around the corner, and there is lots of room for more dancers at Blanchet Catholic High School in Salem. All kinds of dancing is available. Mainstream, plus, advanced, multiple phases of round dancing also. Very talented callers and cuers from Oregon and surrounding areas, as well as featured caller, Johnny Preston and featured cuers, Rey and Sherry Garza. Dancing at the Capitol and a tour of the Capitol are available also. The Wild Cards will call the Trails-In dance on Thursday evening at the Salem Square Dance Center. Help fill the rooms available for dancing and see friends that you haven&rsquo;t seen since Mid-Winter. Time for a square dance reunion.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will be around dancing, so hope to see you and gather some hugs along the way.&nbsp;</p>
