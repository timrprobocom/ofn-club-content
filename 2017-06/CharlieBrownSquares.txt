The Charlie's are putting the finishing touches on our Boatnik Festival Memorial Weekend, featuring Hunter Keller & Randy Lewis. We are looking forward to seeing lots of friends, both old & new! It promises to be 3 days of wonderful fun!!! We also have a group of at least 20 dancers, including the caller/cuer, who will be taking a jet boat trip with us on Monday!! You really don't want to miss this fun weekend!
Our 1st Saturday dance on May 6th brought 2 squares and almost enough for a 3rd square dancing to Ray Holmes and rounds with Bob Dingman.  No matter the amount of dancers, we always have fun!  It was our Ole' dance and included lots of laughter, especially when we danced around sombreros!
May 20th is our Garden Party Plus/A1 dance with Ray Holmes & Steve Murphy and we hope for lots of friends. Will have an update in the next issue since the dance is after publication.
June 3rd is our Home Run Dance Mainstream/Plus dance w/Ray Holmes & Bob Dingman and June 17th is our Picnic on the Beach Plus/A1 dance w/Elaine Funk cueing. 
There was a wonderful turnout at the Star Promenader's Amatuer Nite on May 13th; 5 squares dancing to several different caller and cuers. We all had a great time supporting the new talent in our area!
Our new club officers have now taken the reins and will be working hard to ensure the club is successful. We have lots of work to do, but I know we are all up for it. Congratulations to these officers and thank you for volunteering your time & energy!!
