Happy Hoppers will be hosting 2 fun dances in June.
On the 3rd, Jim Hattrick will be in fine form as usual and June 17th we will end our dancing season with our annual Strawberry Shortcake Dance. YUM! Jim Hattrick will be calling and cueing this dance as well. 

We will be dark for the summer and will be back dancing Sat Sept 2nd, and start up lessons again on Sept 12. 

If you are a Hopper be sure to get our annual Membership Picnic and meeting on your calendars. Sunday Aug 6th we'll eat a feast and have a nice afternoon visiting and catching up.

Our biggest news lately is that our contract to dance at the Clark County Square Dance Center has been renewed for another year. That means well be dancing there through June of 2018. Very good news for our club and those who come to dance with us!

See you across a square,
Melissa James
