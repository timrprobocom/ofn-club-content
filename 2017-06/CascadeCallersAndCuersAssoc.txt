Our 5th Saturday dance in April morphed into the area's benefit dance for Silver Knights, the teen group who is going to the Pacific Northwest Teen Competition in Langley, B.C.  As of this reading, the competition will be over. We sent the teens to competition with our good wishes and good luck. All of the teens attending, their chaperones, and family members must pay their own way. We were thrilled to send them off with over two thousand dollars from the Emerald Empire Area Council. The calling and cueing for this dance was provided by members of CCCA and also the teen caller and cuer. 
 
Prayers for our treasurer, Gail Jackson, on her recent cancer surgery. We pray for a complete recovery. We miss you Gail!
 
CCCA is inviting everyone to join us down in Winston at the Wildlife Safari for our annual benefit dance. We had to skip last year, but we are back. Dancing starts at 1:30 pm and ends at 4:00 pm. This is for a worthy cause and always a lot of fun. June 11th, the second Sunday follows the Buckeroo Roundup. What a nice end to a fun weekend that will be. 
 
Our next CCCA dance isn't until September 30th. We are dark July 29th as the floor in Hall A at the Emerald Empire dance center is being refinished.  We look forward to a beautiful floor when dancing resumes. 
 
Keep on Dancing!
Christina Corelli, CCCA Secretary
