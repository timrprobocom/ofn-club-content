On April 26th we held our "Trifecta" dance; our First Birthday, the Trophy Dance where the club with the highest percentage of members and students would take home the trophy & sponsor the next Trophy Dance, and our New Dancer Jamboree!  We had a full, did I say FULL, hall with over 100 dancers attending.  A great time was had by all who attended and we enjoyed terrific refreshments.  You had to see and try the chocolate coconut cake!  The Rosetown Ramblers had the highest percentage of their club attending and took home the travelling Trophy.
 Tualatin Timber Squares is having two new dancer dances on the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays of June, with the 28th being our Graduation Dance.  Come out and help us have a fun time with our new dancers!  Ice cream for everyone!
 We will not be having lessons during the summer. 
 If the weather reaches 90 degrees we will be dark.  We will post on our website as well: www.TualatinDance.com
