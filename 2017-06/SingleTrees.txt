On June 9th we have our "Reigning Cats and Dogs Annual Benefit Dance" for Greenhill. If you'd like to help, bring your clean old towels and blankets to comfort pets without a home. Dog and cat toys are good to donate, as well as good quality dry pet food (unopened). Checks to Greenhill are always appreciated as is cash. Jim Hattrick will be calling and Jackie Gale cueing.

On June 23rd Terry Halley will be calling with Jackie Gale cueing. Hope to see some visitors for this dance at the beginning of summer.
