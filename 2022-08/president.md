August brings the end of summer vacation, but in Oregon it usually means two more months of summer weather.  Seems hard to believe that in a little over a month my term as President of the OFSRDC will come to an end.  Been an interesting year as we have seen some clubs start dancing again, some decide to hold off and, at least two clubs have decided to fold.  That is sad, but not unexpected given the difficulties negotiating this COVID virus. But, the good news is that a new club is starting up over in Central Oregon.  Maybe that will signal a re-birth of this activity. 

Another thing that will be a “shot in the arm” (pun intended) is classes starting in September. The time is NOW to be promoting your clubs and classes. USDA has a lot of good materials on promoting and marketing. You can get that information from their website at usda.org. 

I try and stay upbeat and positive in this missive, but sometimes I just cannot. I was saddened to hear of the passing of Bob Stutevoss in June. He was in my caller’s class and really helped me when I got back into calling. Others we lost in June were Royal Greenman, Joyce Brown and Ray Jones. Royal and his wife, Sharon, were very involved in square dancing in the Emerald area. Joyce stepped up and learned to cue to keep round dancing going in the Bend area. She was fun to work with. And, Ray. What can I say about Ray?? He and his wife, Zola, were involved with the federation and Mid-Winter festival for many, many years. His dry sense of humor endeared him to me.

Have a good August and stay safe.
          
Hope to see you in a square soon and…..

Let’s Start Dancing Again
