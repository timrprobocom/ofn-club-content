The Buzzin’ Bees had a great dance and picnic early in July and will have another one in August.  I hope you can all come.  It is so nice to dance outside and the Bellcoff is a beautiful place.  The Bees are dark this summer until our potluck/dance in August. It will be at the Bellcoff Residence (11308 NE 149th St. Brush Prairie, WA) with a potluck before starting at 5:30pm. Dancing goes from 7-9 pm.  Hope to see everyone there and have a safe and fun summer.
