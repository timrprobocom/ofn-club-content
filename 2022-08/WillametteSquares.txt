Willamette Squares offers an apology for the late cancellation of their June dance. It was cancelled due to many illnesses and health related problems. However, we are back on track for July, and our regular dance, same time, same station, will take place. 

We hope to see many of our fellow square dancers at Summer Festival. By being held at Blanchet in Salem, it will be close by for Willamette Valley residents to attend.

John and Doris recently enjoyed a week’s road trip equally divided between Reno, Nevada and Arcata, California. Bruce and Judy are still cruisin’ here and there. We can’t keep track of them! We look forward to seeing you all in a square!
