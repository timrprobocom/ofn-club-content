Oak Hills Squares will be dancing over the summer.
 We will be contacting our members each week and if we have enough for a square we will dance.
 If you would like to come along and join us, please contact Linda Kitchin; linda@kitchinonline.com, to find out if we will be dancing on any given Monday.
 Our hall at the Oak Hills gym on NW 153rd is air conditioned and we will be dancing from 6.30-8.30pm. We will be dancing mainstream.
 It would be fantastic to have some visitors.   Be aware however, we do remain a fully vaccinated club and wearing of masks is optional.
