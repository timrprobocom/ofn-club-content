Our June dances both had two squares attending.  All dancers present were also Plus dancers so Randy Dibble called Plus at our Mainstream dance, and after 10 p.m. there was an Advanced tip.   Leonard Snodgrass, our cuer and round dance instructor, cued several tips just especially for our beginning Waltz class so the students could get some floor time.  It was a lot of fun to see the students out on the floor smiling and actually dancing!  
 Our Beginning Waltz lessons, taught by Leonard Snodgrass on Tuesdays at 6:30-8 p.m. at the Chehalem Community Center continue.  If you have completed beginning waltz classes before, come for refresher lessons.  We are just past the half way point so it’s a good time to jump in.   Cost is $6. 
 Our Advanced workshop continues on Tuesday evenings at the Chehalem Community Center, 8-9:30 p.m., called by Randy Dibble.  Cost is $8.
 As of this submission we have not yet had our “Dance Under the Stars” special dance, July 22nd.   On stage will be Darrell Kalmbach calling Mainstream with a half hour of Pre-Plus beginning at 7:30 p.m., and Leonard Snodgrass cueing a mix of rounds.    Instead of dancing at the tennis courts we will be squaring up at the Newberg Les Schwab parking lot, 110 Sitka Avenue.  
 Another reminder that our 5th Saturday Advanced dance, July 30th, is cancelled.  
 We will be dancing in August on the 2nd and 4th Fridays—come and dance with us!
 We are planning for Mainstream lessons Tuesday evenings beginning September 13th.   Cost and times determined soon.
