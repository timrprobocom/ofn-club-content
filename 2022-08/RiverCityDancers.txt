Many of our club members attended the Toe Draggers last dance. We were sorry to hear that it was their last dance, but pleased to see the good turnout. Please keep supporting your square dance community, as this is the only way to keep our favorite pastime going. Many clubs are struggling. 

Last month, even in the 90 plus degree heat, our hall at Milwaukie Community club stayed at a constant 72 degrees. We were surprised and pleased that our air conditioner is working so well and our hall was very comfortable. 

Many clubs are going dark during the summer but River City Dancers continue to dance twice each month. We have changed our dance nights to second and fourth Saturdays now and everyone is welcome to join us. We love visitors.

Our club will be hosting the PAC dance on the fifth Friday night July 29. It will be at our hall at Milwaukie Community Club at 42nd and Jackson in Milwaukie. Darrell Kalmbach will be calling and Tami Helms cuer. Please come join us. It should be a fun evening.
