We continue to dance two a month in Hall B at the Emerald Square Dance Center here in Springfield from 1:30 to 3:30PM.  We aim for the second and 4th Sundays of each month, but sometimes that has to change.  If you want to come dance with us to recorded music, it is best to check the website at cas-sd.yolasite.com first for the tentative schedule, and then if you are not on Fred Beisseâ€™s email list for survey and final notification, please call Fred at 458-221-3564 to find out if we are dancing for sure.

Please come join us.
