Eager Beavers danced in air-conditioned comfort at the Aloha Grange every Monday in June, with Jim Hattrick calling and cueing on June 6th and 20th and Darrel Kalmbach calling on the 13th and 27th.  Jeanine Norden cued for us on June 13th and Connie Clark filled in on June 27th.
 We have been fortunate to have visitors from the Columbia River Dancers, Hoedowners, Sunset Promenaders, TriSquares, and Valley Squares.  We have been having dances with three of four squares dancing!  Thank you visitors!
 In August our club is looking forward to being able to hold our annual picnic after a two-year hiatus due to Covid.  Although everyone is bringing their own picnic food, we will have shared desserts and our traditional fun games on the park lawn.
 There are five Mondays in August, so there are lots of opportunities to come dance with us from 1:00 to 3:00.  We dance Plus with Phase II and III Rounds.  We do not require proof of vaccination and masks are optional, but we ask that you stay home if you have been exposed to Covid or are not feeling well.
