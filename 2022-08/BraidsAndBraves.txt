Club members and families met on June 11 at the home of Jennie and Nate Ramer for a BBQ potluck and meeting. So much fun was had by all that another BBQ may be held the first part of August.

Many of the members attended the Summer Festival July 15-17 and had a great time reconnecting with old friends and meeting new friends. 

Our club campout is scheduled for August 30 to September 1 at Champoeg Park. A potluck will be held the evening of August 31. 

New dancersâ€™ lessons will be started on September 11 from 5:00 to 6:30 p.m. with Leonard Snodgrass at the McMinnville Grange. Sept. 17 will be our first dance for the new season at the Grange with Leonard calling and Sandra Pinion cuing.
