It's finally starting to feel like summer. Our hall is air conditioned so please come join us for our 5th Friday Plus Dance July 29. August 5 and 19 are our Regular first and third Friday Dances.

We all had a great time at Summer Festival right here in town. Thanks to all who assisted in any way with set-up and tear down.

Our new dancers have enjoyed getting floor time and increasing their skills. Thank you all for the warm welcome to the five youth dancers that have joined our club as well as the five adult dancers.

Randy Dibble's Plus Workshop continues Wednesday evenings throughout the summer from 6:30-8:30 p.m. $8.00 per dancer. See you on the dance floor.
