Tri Squares is moving!  Big changes ahead for us, because after many decades in Tigard we have signed a new contract with the Kinton Grange!  So now you will find us on Scholls Ferry Road (near the intersection with Roy Rogers Road.)  But -- not until fall because we're dark until September.  
 In July we kept our dancing shoes on by visiting the River City Dancers and the Valley River Dancers, "Under the Stars".  (Well... tennis shoes for the "Stars" dance because of the sandy outdoor tennis court!),
 In September (at Kinton) we'll begin Sunday afternoon lessons again - please check our OFN and website flyers for dates.  Also in September our first two dances will be with our caller Terry Halley and cuer Sandra Pinion:  on September 9th "Aloha! Welcome to Our New Home!" and on September 23rd our anniversary dance "Celebrate Good Times!"   Please come celebrate our new home with us!
