June swept by in a flash.  It’s always a month of graduations, dance recitals and the beginning of vacation and reunion season. There has been a lot of talk about where the summer vacations will lead us, out of town or around the block?  Hoedowners are hoping that your plans are fun and exciting. 
 On June 11th we had Scott Zinser on stage calling and Randy Lewis cueing. On June 25th it was Randy Dibble calling and Randy Lewis cuing.
 Please join us for our regularly scheduled dances in August. On the 13th we’ll have Craig Abercrombie and Randy Lewis in the house and on August 27th we’ll welcome Randy Dibble and Connie Clark.
 Oh, and for heaven’s sake let’s not forget the Hahn Barn Dance on August 21st. The format has changed a bit; bring your own meal and a dessert to share, starts at 3 pm, dancing 4:30-7pm.
