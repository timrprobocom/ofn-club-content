Our June 18th dance was a lot of fun with two squares.  Our new Members are making our dances and visitations a lot of fun for everyone.  A majority of our members attended the Toe Draggers last dance on June 17th.  So sad to see them close.  The dance was lots of fun and had a very crowded floor.  Thank you Toe's for all your years of square dancing, we will miss you.  
 Our August 20th dance will be Summer Casual, if you want.  We invite you to join us and help make our dance more fun, the more the merrier for everyone.  Mark Wheeler will be our caller and Connie Clark our cuer.  7 to 9:30 pm, Mainstream with every third tip Plus.  Air conditioned.  
 Take care and Dance, Dance, Dance,
  Carolene Siebert
