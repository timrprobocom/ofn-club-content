Our next dance is July 29th with Chuck Simpkins and Rikki Lobato. The dance will be in Grants Pass. We would like thank everyone for coming to Summer Festival and also thank Interstate Highlanders for co-hosting the Festival. Those that didnâ€™t attend missed a great time. Thank you all who helped the committee. We could not have done it without you.

We hope to see everyone out dancing soon!
