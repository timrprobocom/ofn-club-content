The Cherry City Cloggers have been so excited to finally once again be able to do public demonstrations. Our demos are our main way of recruiting people who are interested in learning to clog. By the time this article goes to print, we will have performed at World Beat, Marion County Fair, and the Salem Art Festival.  We hope to have several interested people by fall. Whether or not we have a beginner class in the fall, however, is going to depend on whether we are able to recruit an instructor as well. If anyone reading this is a clogger and would be interested in instructing or knows of someone who would be, please contact Maryellen Ramseyer at ramseyer_mary@hotmail.com.  We hope to be starting our beginner class in September.

In the meantime, if there is anyone who has already taken lessons and is looking for a place to clog, we would love to have you join us. We still offer three class sessions:
one at 4:00 p.m. class, a 5:30 p.m. class of beginners and the intermediate/advanced class that starts at 6:30.  We'd love to see you there!
