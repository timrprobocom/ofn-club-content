The club was dark the last three Thursdays in June so some members could travel, and it was also a financial decision to go dark during that time.

We started out on July 7 with a regular session and on July 14 we hosted the Trails In dance for Summer Festival. A great way to start off the Festival weekend. 

As time goes by, we will start talking about fall lessons worked around Randyâ€™s hip surgery in October. Stay tuned for more details as more plans are made.
