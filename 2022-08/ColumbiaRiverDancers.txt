The Columbia River Dancers will be dark for dances in July and August.  BUT, we will continue to hold classes on Sundays during the summer.  We will do round dance level 2 lessons from 5-6 PM (currently 2-step).  Beginning square dance lessons will be from 6-7:30 or so depending on how fast skills are acquired.  The goal is to have a beginners dance the last Sunday of each month.  Since our classes have been around two squares this has been possible so far.
 The only reason we would cancel class is when it is too hot.  While our current grange has proven to be cooler than our old grange we have made the decision that if the outdoor  temperature will be 90 degrees at 5 PM classes will be canceled.
 Lastly, even though we will be dark it does not mean will not be dancing.  We recognize that at this time in square dance history we all survive together or sink together.  My wife and l will be visiting and dancing and we encourage each member of every club to do the same.
