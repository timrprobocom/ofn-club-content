Raymond Jones, a Past President, (2011-2012), of the Oregon State Federation passed away on June 28, 2022.  Raymond had been struggling off an on, for almost two months with digestive problems; and taken to the hospital was diagnosed with Pancreatitis, and this also affected his one remaining functioning Kidney.  He was in the hospital, then to a care center for Rehab. and Physical Therapy, but ended up back in the hospital with failing kidney.  He came home on Sunday, June 26 with Hospice Care, and passed away on Tuesday in his sleep with no pain.

We first started coming to State Federation meetings in 1986 when we were co-chairman of the 1987 Mid-Winter Festival, and again in 1988 when we were Chairman of the Festival.  In 1990 to 1992 we were the Publicity & State Reporter for the Federation.  From 1991 to 1994 we were Program Chairman and on the executive "Trail Board' of Oregon's 1994 National Square Convention in Portland, and we were also again on the Program committee for Oregon's 2005 National Square Dance Convention.  In the early 2000's we were the State Historian until 2011, when we were elected by Emerald Empire Area Council to be their State Delegate.  We were appointed and served as Oregon Goodwill Ambassadors from 2001 to 2005, and enjoyed that in our Motorhome travels throughout Oregon and in areas in the rest of the U.S.A.  Then in 2017 we were so honored to be chosen to receive the Randall Award, it meant a lot to Raymond as he had known, and admired, Buddy Randall.

And--as you all know, our family of Square Dancing friends are always special.

Bob Stutevoss, a long-time caller in Oregon for many clubs and festivals, passed away on June 24.

Bob and Jan were long time callers in the greater Portland area before moving to Grants Pass where he called for a number of years. From there to Yuma, AZ and calling in the resort parks.

Bob was one of the original Chinook Boys and traveled nationally with the group. He recorded on both the Chinook and Hoedowner Square Dance labels. He and wife Jan were lifetime friends of ours and he will be greatly missed by many, many dancers that he has taught and entertained through the years.

Bob and Jan's kids will be having a service back in Oregon at a later date to honor Bob.  Jan is in Emerald Springs  and her daughter said that "she seems to be loving it".  As of right now they would like her to settle in before receiving visitors.  There are a few of us here in Yuma that will check in to see when she is available for visitors.  Anyone still interested in sending a card can mail it to 3051 S. Minneola Avenue - Yuma, AZ. 85365.  Even though their house has already been sold, her daughter will make sure she receives any that are sent.
