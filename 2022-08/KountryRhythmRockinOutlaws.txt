Howdy Dancers!

We have had to make a huge change in our Country Fever Dance/Campout Weekend on Oct 7-9 2022 with Jet Roberts. With his home base work schedule and trying to get an affordable flight to fit his schedule and our Club's contracted budget with him, we and Jet had to make the difficult decision to not have him as our featured Caller for this scheduled 
weekend.

Jim Steele has been a fantastic caller since 1961, and instead of sharing, will now be the featured caller for the entire weekend!  Everything is still the same with price, food menu and dance schedules, everyone can still bring RV's and camp right on the property as the dance hall.

Please make note that our Pre-Registration date has changed from Sept 1, 2022 to August 15, 2022 as we need to know further in advance the headcount for our food menu as we feed everyone every meal all weekend long!
