R Square D had two fun dances in June and we enjoyed ice cream at each one! Thank you to George & Patty Hermann who called and cued the June 22nd dance!
 August 10th is our “Back to School” dance, with Craig Abercrombie calling and Susan Healea cueing. We will collect supplies and donate them to a local school, as we have done for many years.  Root beer floats will be served at the break.
 “Summer’s Last Hurrah” will be Wednesday, August 24th, and we will serve ice cream sundaes after the dance.  Craig will call and cue this dance.
 Members are looking forward to our August club meeting that will be held at Pat Faires’ home on Mayfield Lake.  We will BBQ hamburgers and hot dogs and pot luck the other food.  It’s always a fun day!
 Our summer dances are casual and our hall is air conditioned, so join us for fun dancing!  Plus dancing and intermediate rounds from 7-8 PM and mainstream with phase II rounds from 8-9:30.
