The new Sunset Promenaders Delegates to the TVC are Tom & Janice Sminia.  We thank Floyd Wolf and Judy Schnase for their service for last year. 
 The club is continuing to have both Mainstream and Plus dances and that includes during the summer as the hall has good air conditioning. 
 Our Plus dances attendance have been smaller than before the Pandemic but hopefully will increase with time.  We are thankful for a lot of visitors, we really appreciate them, thank you.
 Our Mainstream dances are about three squares and we have not had many visitors. We also are not getting all our members to the dances either, some of our pre-Covid-19 members have not even paid their dues.  All of this said we are not having enough income to break even; lucky we have a good reserve to fill in.  We did not have a good set of lessons this year, so we need to get out and get some more people interested in square dancing. We are going to add a Plus tip into our dance schedules again.
At both our Plus and Mainstream dances, the club is now having a social time with finger food and coffee after the dances.  This is to hopefully get more dancers to the dances and help improve communication between the members.  We are also going to organize visitations to other clubs to see if we socialize with them and hopefully get more visitors to our dances.  We really do appreciate visitors.
 The Promenaders had 11 members at the Last Toe Draggers dance, it was fun, very loud and crowded like some of our dances in the past.  There were about 90 dancers in the Kinton Grange with K.C.  Curtis, Darrell Kalmbach, Terry Halley, and George Hermann calling, with Tami Helms, Sandra Pinion, and Connie Clark cueing.
