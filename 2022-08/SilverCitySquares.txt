We danced on our trailer at the Mt. Angel 4th of July Parade. We had enough for a square and some to switch in and out.

There is still a chance to dance with us this summer! We have been averaging two squares at our dances this summer, and so far, our hall has stayed comfortable - windows, doors open and fans going. If the upstairs gets too warm, we can dance downstairs where it is cooler.

Julia is partway through waltzÂ lessons and has 15 students. She is planning to be finished by the first week of September.

We have started planning for square lessons in September and are hoping for a good turnout again. Several parents and family of our youth have indicated that they will come.
