The club went dark for the second dance in June due to illnesses. The first dance in July was at the Salem Square Dance Center with George Hermann calling and Leonard Snodgrass as a guest cuer. Molly Fairly had previous commitments.
	
We are dark in August due to the Polk County Fair taking over the fairgrounds the first two weeks of August to set up for the fair, host the fair and then take everything down and put away.

We will have our annual meeting in August to certify our elections, make some future dance plans, get dues paid, and get the club membership booklet prepared.

Lessons will start in September 11 at 6:00 p.m. at the Salem Square Dance Center.
