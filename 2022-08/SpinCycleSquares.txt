We dance every Sunday from 4 - 6 at the dance center in Springfield on Yolanda.  Tim Matteson is a great caller and will call whatever level we can muster.  We've had a few fairly new dancers who are having a great time.  We have individually wrapped snacks on hand.   We invite you all to join us!  We're a fun bunch--that's for sure. All dances are casual.
  
Please call our president, David Lajoie, at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are, indeed, dancing.  Once in a blue moon we are dark.
