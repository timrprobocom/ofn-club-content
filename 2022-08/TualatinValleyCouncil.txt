The June TVC meeting was held via Zoom with 25 attendees.  Zoom will remain the meeting method for the remainder of the year.  New president, Ursula Kuhn was unable to officiate as she was busy vacationing in Barbados,  so vice president Linda and K.C. Curtis officiated.  The TVC Directory for 2022-2023 is in the process of being edited and printed.  We will need to know how many to print so clubs will be asked to provide the number of copies they wish to have.
