Big changes!  We are dancing again.  Our new club caller is Lane Clem and Terry Halley has been filling in when Lane is busy elsewhere.  Our radio advertising to find dancers or students for lessons may have helped.  The dances are held weekly on Tuesdays from 5:30 to 7:30 at the Elks Lodge in Tillamook. We are using the hall upstairs.  It is a good idea to call before you make the trip to see if we have enough folks for a square.  For up to date information see: www.wavesteppers.org.
