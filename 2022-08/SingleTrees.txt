Our club had its usual 4th Friday dance on June 24 with Jim Hattrick calling.  This dance was our annual Reigning Cats and Dogs Dance, a benefit for Greenhill Humane Society.  We raised $250.00 between our dances and the club to donate to Greenhill.

Jim did a great job of calling and cueing.  Jackie Gale was under the weather and unable to join us that evening.  The three squares plus in attendance had a grand time and Jim did too!

We are not dancing in July but will have our club picnic on the 10th at our member, Suzanne Peterson’s country property.  We hope to see more visitors from out of town as well as more local dancers come join us on August 26 with Jim Hattrick calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  This will be our Hawaiian Luau Dance so feel free to wear your leis and Hawaiian shirts and muumuus or just come casual for summer.   If it’s hot, we’ll get the A/C going!

I’d like to give a shout out to our visitors who regularly dance with us from Woodburn, Corvallis, Salem, Cottage Grove and Roseburg.  We appreciate their willingness to drive so far.  Of course, we must give credit to Jim Hattrick for drawing them in.
