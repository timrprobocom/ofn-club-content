We look forward to our next Fifth Saturday Dance and invite you to join us on July 30, 2022 which is not too long from now.  We have a cushioned wood floor and air conditioning so we will all be comfy and have a grand time!  It's casual dress for this time of year. We are at 2095 Yolanda in Springfield.  Take Highway 126 to Mohawk Exit.  Turn north at the exit.  This becomes 19th and will be residential which confuses some.  Turn right on Yolanda and voila!  The hall will be on your right!

We were so sorry to lose a former CCCA member.  Royal Greenman who called for Wagon Wheelers and Diamond Circulators passed away in June.  Royal's late wife, Sharon Greenman, cued for a number of clubs.  Sharon passed away in 2019.  We also learned that Bob Stutevoss, formerly of the Portland area, passed away in Arizona.  He and Jan have been down south for some time now.  And, a cuer from Bend, Joyce Brown, also passed away.  We want to remember these wonderful folks and keep their families in our thoughts and prayers.

Kirby Goode's ashes were scattered on The Metolius River at the Whirl-A-Ways camp out.  Kirby loved square dancing, teaching square dancing and fly fishing on the Metolius.  Christina thanks the Whirl-A-Ways members who knew and loved Kirby who accompanied her and her fiancé, Jake Westra, to one of the bridges on the Metolius.  It was a beautiful and memorable experience.
