      Happy New Year! 2014 was a great year but 2015 will be even better! Timber Twirlers club has a new home. After dancing three dances at the new hall, the club voted to make it a permanent change. Our new address is 1115 28th Ave SW, the United Methodist Church in Albany. We loved dancing at our former location, the IOOF hall in Albany, but the new facility gives us more parking, everything is on one floor and many other nice things, so come and join us at our next dance.  We dance the first and third Fridays of the month. See you in a square. Sandy
