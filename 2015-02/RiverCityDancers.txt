We welcomed 2015 with a trip to Paris, Midnight in Paris, as a matter of fact.  The many talents of our club members were evident everywhere.  Decorations of Eiffel towers, the river Seine, chandeliers, wine bottles holding the water on the tables and others made the evening more real.  The food was prepared by a committee of fine chefs.  Who knew Greg Peterson and Sandy, under the instruction of Tim Keck, could make carrots so tasty.   Les, Renee and Tami did a great job of calling and cueing.  It was an extra bonus that George and Patty Hermann joined us and George even called a tip.  There was a variety of apparel, and several "Pierres" and formal attire.  Special thanks to Barbara (Dave) Schmidt and  Cathy (Frank) Betzer for all their dedication to make our evening unforgettable.
	Come visit us in the near future.
