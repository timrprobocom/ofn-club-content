A Blessed New Year to all of you!  We had a wonderful turnout at our New Dancers' Dance in December.  Since this was also our benefit dance, we were able to make a sizable donation to the Sweet Home Fire Department for their Sharing Tree Program.
We will hold our 58th Birthday Dance on February 28th.  We would love to have you help us celebrate.  Then, on March 14th, 2015, we will hold a Pi Dance.  This will be a casual dance (or mathematician-geek-nerd, etc.)  As you all know, Pi is an irrational number so the digits never terminate and never repeat.  The first few digits are 3.1415926 (3-14-15 at 9:26 p.m. we can cheer!)  This will be our one and only Pi Dance since 3-14-15 isn't apt to come around again anytime soon.  By the way, we will be serving all kinds of pie!
Our camp-out at Camp Koinonia is coming up the 4th weekend in April, so put the date on your calendar and plan to enjoy a wonderful weekend in a lovely setting along the Santiam River with delicious food, plenty of indoor and outdoor games, visiting and, of course, dancing!

Thank you,
Sharon Arthur
