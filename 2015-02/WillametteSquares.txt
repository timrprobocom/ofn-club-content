     Willamette Squares hosted their Christmas dance in December with plenty of frivolity and dancing. Goodies adorned the festively decorated tables, and if you have a sweet tooth, you were undoubtedly satisfied. We hosted a New Dancers' dance the first week in January. Happy New Year, everyone!  May 2015 be a year of square dancing galore. Jodee Howard
Just a reminder that due to the Midwinter Festival, WillametteSquares has gone dark for the month of January.
