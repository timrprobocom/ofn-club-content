	Last month, I wrote about fundraising activities within your club.  Most clubs need about four squares to meet expenses.  If your club is not getting at least four squares, you will probably need some fundraisers at some point.  Of course that varies, but the rule is about four squares.
	 Strangely, it doesn't seem to matter so much how many members your club has, as its ability to bring in at least four squares average, or have caring people willing to be "worker bees".  That's where the fundraising comes in; it takes "worker bees" to create successful fundraisers.
	The only other options are to merge with another club (preferably one dancing the same night), in hopes the total number of dancers attracted will average at least four squares.  If nothing else, a merger can potentially increase the number of "worker bees", to keep the new club afloat.  The only other option is to cease business altogether.  Yes, square dance clubs are a business!
	Lastly, these are not official council recommendations.  They are merely what's being talked about within the delegate circle.
	The December 21st Jim Hattrick benefit dance was not our dance, but it garnered over $5500, as well as 200 get-well cards from all over the country.  We lost count, but there were not quite twenty squares.
