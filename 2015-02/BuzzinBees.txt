Greetings and Happy New Year from the Buzzin bees. This year in December we changed our tradition of gathering toys for tots and did a collection for residents at 2 low income assisted living facilities. We had a fantastic turn out and I delivered 5 full bags of donated goods to Woodland Assisted Living and Arbor Ridge Assisted Living.  It brought tears to my eyes to see the gratitude from the staff and residents of those facilities. Well done, bees!
	We are making a second attempt at lessons.  They start January 11,2015 at 6pm at the Hazel Dell Grange. First lesson is free.
	February brings us a Sweetheart dance on 2/7 and a mystery trip on 2/21/15. We extend a special invitation to one and all to come eat pie on 3/7/15 when we have our pie eating contest. Chocolate cream pie for the contest and lots of other pies for the break. Happy dancing!
