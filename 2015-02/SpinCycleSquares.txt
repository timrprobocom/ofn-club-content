
Beginner lessons started January 11th, but if there are people who'd like to try, there is still time; 5:30 Sunday evenings in Hall A of Emerald Dance Center in Springfield, 2095 Yolanda Drive.  The first couple lessons are free.
We encourage dancers of all levels from Beginners through A2 to join us on Sunday evenings.  We dance from 5:30 - 8:00.  Our caller/instructor is Tim Matteson.  Tim is proficient in teaching and calling any level.  We are so blessed.  Right now we are keeping Tim's mom, Virginia Matteson, in our thoughts and prayers as she is not doing well.  Virginia makes all of Tim's shirts.  He has a lot, and they are all different and unique.  Tim picks out the fabric, and his mom makes the shirt.  How cool is that!

Happy dancing!
