	We concluded our PLUS lessons on December 7th with 14 graduates:  five C & P members, two S & P members and included the youth from Silver City Squares adding extra excitement to our PLUS class. Congrats and thank you to all the students.  Squaws & Paws and Chaps & Petticoats joined for a Christmas Party on December 14 at the Maplewood Grange and afterwards got our dancers on the floor with their instructor, Scott Zinser.
	Squaws and Paws and our club have enjoyed the camaraderie of hosting Mainstream lessons and we will graduate eight students on January 18.  It has been a blessing to team up with another club, putting more angels on the floor and share in the hall rent, instructor fees and responsibilities of hosting lessons.  In these times when clubs are met with declining membership, teaming up and sharing a hall certainly cuts expenses and adds to the ambiance of the experience. We highly recommend such camaraderie.
	Our Mainstreamers will enjoy, for the first time, the excitement of Mid-Winter Festival in Albany, January 23-25th.  We want to extend our appreciation to the organizers of this event; all their hard work grows our square dance community -- thank you.
	Our February dances are theme dances!  February 6, Chaps will host the Tri-council (PAC, TVC and Evergreen council) "win-the-TROPHY" dance:  the club with the greatest percentage of membership in attendance wins the TROPHY, and thus hosts the next dance.  February 18, features Les Seeley calling our "Flintstone" dance and Lonnie Sycks cueing.  We hope you will attend - we'll keep the light on for you!
Happy Feet :
