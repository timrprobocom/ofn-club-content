  Some folks were dreaming of snow, so our first dance had a "White Christmas" theme.  Dancers dressed in white to conjure visions of snowflakes twirling on the floor.  Hearts were not frosty, as we collected toys and food which we donated to Southminster Presbyterian's charitable campaigns.  Thanks to everyone for living the spirit of the season so generously.
 Our Mastering Mainstream/Beginning Plus lessons ended.  It's great to see our new Plus dancers doing so well at the dances.  
 Four squares romped at the Christmas dance - a wonderful turnout since so many of our members were out of town for the holidays.  We hope to see you at our dances February 7th and 21st at the Aloha Grange.
