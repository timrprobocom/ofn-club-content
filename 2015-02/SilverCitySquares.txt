We had a nice turnout for our December dance with a lot of energy on the floor.Our January dance is both our new dancer dance and our baked potato dinner - dinner at 7:00 p.m. with the rounds starting at 7:30 p.m.
     We are working on our March dance and we are trying something new! This is a Friday the 13th so we are doing a "Superstitions Dance" with the decorations showing various superstitions - both good and bad. We are planning on having a ladder set up in the middle of the dance floor - do you dare to dance under it? There will also be a black cat wandering around  and  it may even join a square or two. See you soon. Thomas Buchheit
