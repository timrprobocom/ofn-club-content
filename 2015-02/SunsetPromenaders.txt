 We started our square dance lessons on every Sunday January 4th, from 4 to 6 pm at the Hillsboro Odd fellows Hall and we are hoping to have a bunch of new square dancers graduate.  This is a big commitment for students, angels and caller/instructor, but it is fun too.
 Our Plus Promenaders dance is going well with four plus squares each night, this dance is on the first and third Thursdays; Intermediate level pre-rounds at 7:00 until 7:30; Plus dance from 7:30 until 9:30, and a break afterwards.  Darrell (Erin) Kalmbach is calling and Ken (Dianne) Pratt is cueing.  Please come visit us sometime soon.
 We enjoyed a visitation of two squares of Promenaders to the Hoedowners.
 We had and hope all of you dancers had a great Christmas and New Year this past year.  That time of the year seems to be a very busy time in our lives.
 We want to invite all you dancers to come to our dances.  The Sunset Promenaders have a Mainstream dance on the first and third Saturdays of the month with Mike (Julie) Stout calling, and Ken (Dianne) Pratt cueing at the Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall.  We have Intermediate pre-Rounds from 7:30 until 8:00 and Mainstream dance 8:00 to 10:00 with a break afterwards. God bless!
