 Even with all the requests for food for food banks in December, there were still cans clustered on our stage to go into our barrel.  We had our usual good time dancing to Randy Dibble and Jeanine Norden for our final dance of 2014.  We look forward to lots more great dances with our favorite caller and cuer.
