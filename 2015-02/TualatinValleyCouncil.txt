 The TVC helped usher in the New Year with a festive good time.  Scott Zinser called a lively dance with Molly Combs cueing the rounds.  The evening started with a lasagna dinner, followed by dancing, and then Auld Lang Syne.  The evening was enjoyed by over ten squares of dancers from eight clubs plus independents.  The Sunset Promenaders had the highest percentage of their club in attendance but since they had already won the last TVC Banner, their President awarded the prize to the next runner-up, Hoedowners.
 Since the OFN is now online and published mid-month, you still have time to consider two January TVC events: 1) the annual TVC President's Meeting.  Each year we have an appreciation meeting and potluck dinner for our current and past club presidents.  This year it will be held at the Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall on Jan 26th and will include a potluck dinner at 6:00.  A short business meeting will begin at 7:00 followed with Gary Clark (TVC President) announcing the 2014 TVC Recognition Award recipient; and 2) on January 31st the TVC will be holding a fifth Saturday dance at the Kinton Grange.  The Mid Winter Rebound Dance will feature the calling of Darrell Kalmbach and cueing of Deb Combs.  The evening will begin with at 7:30 with Pre-Rounds followed at 8:30 with Mainstream. Every 3rd tip will be Plus including intermediate rounds.  We look forward to seeing you all at Mid Winter.
