Our New Year's Eve party (An Evening in New York) brought us about six squares, and there was plenty food for all.  Our loyal treasurer, Buck Bankrupt, says this may be our first New Year's Dance to make a profit!  It was somewhat of a risk because we specifically targeted new dancers.  There wasn't this much excitement in the air since my silly sister lost her petticoat in the middle of a tip.  Ah, To err is human, but it feels divine!
	February will be a great month for us.  We'll have our Valentine's Dance on the 11th, and we will have a Carnival Dance on the 25th.  See you there!
