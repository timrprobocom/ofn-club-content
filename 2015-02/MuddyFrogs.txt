February 15 will be the Muddy Frogs' combination of Valentine Dance and anniversary celebration, with our own Bill and Neva Reid doing the calling and cueing.  The dance will be from 3:00-5:00 p.m. at the M-F Community Building, with a potluck following.  We hope to see many of your smiling faces!
Neva Reid will begin six weeks of social ballroom waltz lessons the second Sunday in February from 3:45 . 5:00 p.m. at the Milton-Freewater Community Building.  That has been a very popular class, and we are expecting a good group again.  Following that will be six weeks of jive/swing lessons.
