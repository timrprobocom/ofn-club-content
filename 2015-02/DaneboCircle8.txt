All area clubs had members who attended the New Year's Eve Dollar Dance.  Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli called and cued.  There were several dancers from out of town and one fellow, Perry, who came from St. Louis, Missouri.  He knew he'd be in this area and got online to find a dance.  He was welcomed and felt right at home.  He square danced and round danced, too.  We had almost eleven squares!  $186 from the Split the Pot will be donated to this year's annual benefit for 'Honor Flight.'  The recipient of the Split the Pot donated it back so that we'd have a nice amount to donate.  What a selfless and generous gesture.
Danebo Circle 8's members who are willing to run for next year's board positions are: President, Randy Grayboyes; Vice President, Janet Geiger; Secretary, Pat Preston; and for Treasurer, Sharon Greenman and Rich Burdick.  We thank these people for being willing to run for office.  We owe a huge Thank You to Connie Seamans for being President this year.  She has done a great deal for our club and is much appreciated.  She not only had some great ideas but implemented them as well.  Thanks, Connie!  A big thank you also to Chuck Root for being our Treasurer for the past few years.  He was penny perfect and careful with our funds.  Thanks, Chuck!
The area clubs will have another set of beginner lessons starting February 11, a Wednesday.  Lessons will be from 7:00 to 8:30 at the Emerald Dance Center.  Another chance to bring folks to join us for this fun activity!  Wednesday was chosen as there were folks who could not come on Tuesday and/or Thursday the last time.

Keep on dancing.'
