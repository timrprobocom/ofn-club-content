 The noises heard on the rooftop and inside the Catlin hall were not just those of old Saint Nick but of joyful dancers, square dancing to the sounds of the holidays .  
 R Square D had a busy December starting with 20 of our club members attending the Thankful Christmas dance put on by Cougar Squares.   A feast, with Santa attending for pictures, gifts for all attendees and a full dance floor that delighted in stepping to the sounds of the Christmas music.  Cougar Squares really knew how to get the holiday season started.  
 We were thankful to all the dancers that brought toys to be donated to the Salvation Army at our toy dance on the 12th.  Holiday tunes were called by Craig Abercrombie and everyone jingled their way through the evening. 
 R Square D finished up lessons in December and will be starting a new set on January 7, 2015.  We would love to see you. 
 Please come join us in February for our Sweetheart dance on February 13th and on the 28th we will be having a benefit dance for our local Emergency Support Shelter.
