     Braids and Braves have kept very busy dancing with our new mainstream class the last several months. We have about a square of enthusiastic class members that we enjoy dancing with each week. The last several months, a number of our club members and class members have made the rounds visiting other clubs for regular and new dancer dances. After our December club dance, a number of us enjoyed lively conversation and camaraderie at a local pizza restaurant. We are currently looking into the possibility of new club outfits so...maybe you will see us prancing about in our new "duds" sometime soon! Jennie Ramer
