<li><a>Ray Claussen Obituary</a>
<div>
<p>
Ray passed away at age 85 on January 7, 2015.  Ray had been diagnosed 
with liver cancer not long before his passing.  He was a strong advocate 
for square and round dancing.  Ray danced over 50 years and was always 
showing up at various clubs and functions.  He loved to dance.  
<p>
Ray had planned to attend the January 10 dance in Sweet Home, and his daughter 
from Morrow, Oregon was down to be with him and take him.  He figured it 
would be his last dance to attend.  He was that committed to dancing and 
being with his square and round dance family.  He was a lifetime member of 
the Sweethome Squarenaders and will be missed by many.
<p>
Ray was a weather fan, measuring rainfall and keeping track of the temperature 
and other weather phenomena.  He'd call friends to compare rainfall and 
temperatures, etc.  He had, at one time, reported his findings to one of the 
local television stations. 
<p>
A Celebration of Life Service was held in Lebanon January 31 at the American Legion Hall.
Ray also loved to play cribbage and pinochle and had a game lined up with friends before his death.
Cards may be sent to Ray's children, Robert Claussen and Karen Dennis at 39941 Crestview Lane,
Lebanon, OR 97355.  Our thoughts and prayers to Ray's family.

Oh my gosh, where do I begin.  As you know, I had a serious emergency
surgery on November 13.  After three weeks in the hospital I am finally
home and slowly on the mend (I think).  I had a ruptured duodenum
that could not be repaired because of the location of the tear and the
fragility of my organs.   They placed three drain tubes in my belly to
keep all drainage from the wound and a staple line at the base of the
stomach to keep anything from going through the duodenum.  Two weeks
ago I had a cat scan that showed that the rupture has healed.  I am
now transitioning from being fed through the vein to being fed through
one of the tubes in my belly.  I started having severe cramping so they
have slowed the feeding in the tube.  I seem to be tolerating the tube
feeding better this week so things are looking up.
<p>
As you know, Daryl and Yvonne Clendenin organized a wonderful benefit
dance for us.  Judy and I are speechless and overwhelmed by the outpouring
of support.  Never did we think there were so many dancers, callers and
cuers pulling for us.  How can we show our gratitude?  Thank you just
doesn't seem sufficient but it is all we have.  We would like to extend
a special thank you to Daryl and Yvonne for their continued support.
We would also like to thank the callers and cuers who supported the
dance. Thank you Craig Abercrombie, Connie Clark, George Clark, KC Curtis,
Randy Dibble, Bev Flint, Chuck Garner, Ellen Halley, Mike, Halley, Terry
Halley, Darryl Kalmback, Richard Lane, Bill Lundin, Roger Putzler, Jim
Raupp, Renee' Ruud, Les Seeley, Julie Stiers, Lonnie Syckes, David Trout,
Ray Walz, and Mark Wheeler.  Please forgive us if we missed anyone.
We were also told that several clubs donated baskets for raffles and
the Happy Hoppers manned the kitchen.  A HUGE thank you goes to everyone
involved.  There were approximately 34 squares of dancers in attendance.
WOW!  We haven't seen that many dancers at a local dance in a long time.
<p>
Judy and I are so grateful to be part of such a caring and wonderful
square dance community.  Your generosity has lessened our financial
burden with this lengthy illness and we will never be able to repay you.
More importantly, your love and friendship will never be forgotten.
<p>
Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!
<p>
Jim and Judy
