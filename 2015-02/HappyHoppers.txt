Our New Year's Eve dance was a raging success with about 15 squares of happy celebrants.  The Clark County Square Dance Center was converted to a Venetian motif, complete with gondola for those special photo ops.  We feasted on a hearty lasagna dinner.  Craig Abercrombie and Adam Christman collaborated on the calling while cueing was covered by Dorothy Lowder.  Just after midnight, we were all very pleasantly surprised to be witness to the wedding ceremony of our club treasurer Melody Wilson and her partner-for-life Darrell Mitchell.  By all means, a special way to start the year and an evening to remember!
	We are continuing with the monthly cycle for our Monday evening square dance lessons, with Craig Abercrombie presiding in Jim's absence.  Through May, we encourage beginning dancers to start introductory lessons on the first Monday of each month at 7:30.  Plus lessons start at 6:30, Basic 1 at 7:30, Basic 2 at 8:45, and Mainstream from 9:15 through 9:45.
	As always, we have Plus dances on the first and third Saturdays of the month at the Clark County Square Dance Center.  Pre-rounds start at 7:30, with squares at 8:00.  Our January 17 dance will be a benefit dance for Jim Hattrick, with Craig Abercrombie calling and Jeanine Norden cueing.
