December was a busy month for our Club.  We wrapped up our annual fund raiser of making and selling wreaths that we began in November.  Thanks to a dedicated work crew we were able to make and sell 137 wreaths.   The round dancers had a combined holiday and birthday dance cued by Neil this month and they danced to a fabulous selection of pretty Christmas songs.  Our students are now joining us at our Saturday night dances and it is nice to see them on the dance floor with us.  We ended our Christmas dance with all of the dancers forming a giant circle and led by Don Marshall we sang Silent Night together before we ended the dance.  New Year's Eve was celebrated in style dancing to KC Curtis.  Complete with silly hats, tiaras and noise makers the New Year was welcomed in at midnight with balloons dropping from the ceiling with prizes in some of the balloons.  It required a little luck and a lot of fancy foot work combined with super speedy stomping to be the first to pop the balloons to find a prize but fortunately our dancers were up to the task!
