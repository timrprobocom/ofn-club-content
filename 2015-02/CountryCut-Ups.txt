A new year is well under way and here we are in the new online format of OFN. One of the interesting things about life is that it has seasons. Some things or some people are here for a season, and then they go and are replaced by new things or new people in our lives. Sometimes, these changes pass smoothly and we hardly notice that fall has slipped into winter or winter is thawing to become spring, because the change is gradual. Other times, the changes are more abrupt or uncomfortable, even positive changes take a transition period to get used to the new. We thank Patti Nelsen for serving as our club president through a difficult season, and we welcome Doug and Kathie Femrite as our interim presidential couple until the May elections. We are grateful to all members who fill these volunteer positions as officers or board members, or simply step up to serve on kitchen and door duty or housekeeping.

	Our club enjoyed bringing in the New Year with Richard Lane calling and Debbie Combs cueing. The taco bar food was outstanding, thanks to Don and Michelle Garwood and their crew. We dug out the hats and noise makers to welcome 2015 as the balloons dropped on us. A few balloons escaped earlier in the evening to the delight of the youth that were there.
     We welcome the longer days of February and the hope it brings for warmer weather and brighter days. In the mean time, keep on dancing and come to the Boring Barn often with your warm hearts and bright smiles.
