 December was a busy month for the Eager Beavers.  We had visitations to the TriSquares, Sunset Promenaders, Hoedowners, and attended the benefit dance for Jim Hattrick.  As some of you know, Jim calls our third Monday dances.  Our prayers are with him and we are hoping for a full recovery.  For now, Daryl Clendenin will be calling our third Monday dances.
 We do a club dine out after every fifth Monday dance.  In January, 24 of us went to Azteca and enjoyed the fellowship, the food, and of course, the happy hour margaritas!
 At the TVC New Years Eve dance there were 18 members in attendance.  We had a great time dancing to Scott Zinser and Molly Combs.
  Our dance schedule has changed slightly, adding intermediate rounds starting at 1:00PM, followed by Phase II at 1:15PM, and Plus at 1:30 until 3:15PM.  We are increasing our door donation to $4 per person effective February 2nd. 
 Remember, dancing is an excellent way to keep warm so all plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00-3:15 p.m., at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.  Please check for up to date information at www.eagerbeavers.info.
