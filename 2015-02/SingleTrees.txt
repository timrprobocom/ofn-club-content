
Whirl-A-Ways, Single Trees and Danebo Circle 8 hosted an excellent Christmas dinner and dance; something like eleven squares attended.  The food and the dancing were excellent! 
When Roger Putzler called the Buccaneer Dance, first Friday in January, he was limping; he said it's what happens when an old man shouldn't be on a ladder removing Christmas lights from the house.  Now, he and Linda are off to Arizona to attend baseball Spring Training. 
We will hold elections for the next Executive Board soon as well as start Beginners' lessons on February 11th.    
 We look forward to February's dances: Our Sweetheart of a 51st Birthday Dance will happen on February 13th, with The Wild Cards calling and Helen Halley cueing the Rounds.  Craig Abercrombie is on board to call and cue on February 27th.
