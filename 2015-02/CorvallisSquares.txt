      February is very special for our club as it is the month of our Birthday Dance, on Valentine's Day!  Due to our normal hall not being available, we'll hold this dance at the Corvallis Senior Center, which has a wonderful wooden dance floor.
      Our mainstream lessons are going well and we have several students who are enthusiastic and energetic. Thanks to all who have hosted the New Dancers' dances; they've been a lot of fun! 
      We're looking forward to our coast trip March 13-15 at Gleneden Beach Community Club and all dancers are welcome! We're dancing both Friday and Saturday nights.  Karen
