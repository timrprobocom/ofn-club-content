     We took Christmas and New Year's off to be with families and we went back to dancing on January  8 to review our West Coast Swing maneuvers that we may have forgotten by not dancing for two weeks.
     Our class continues on for a few more weeks and then the adventure begins again by figuring out what kind of rhythm we want to do next. We are also looking at new ways to bring in new class members and yet keep the current members in attendance. Stand by for more news as it comes along when plans are made. Happy New Year to all our dancing friends.  Marilyn Schmit
