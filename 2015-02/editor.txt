Remember that YOU are in control of the
dance information that gets displayed in the main section down below.
You can change the callers and cuers, you can set a theme, you can make
a dance go dark (or not), and you can set flyers.  You can even add 
additional special dances.

To do any of that, you need to go to the 
<a href="/ClubInfo/">state directory club info</a> area.  Use the "Dance" page 
to update your regular dance information, and use the "Edit"  page to edit 
specific dance information.
