Cupid can be seen flying low this month, spreading Love everywhere, and he's guiding all who love Plus dancing to our 2nd Friday dance!  
 Come out to the Winona Grange in Tualatin on Friday the 13th and get a lucky start on your Valentine's Day weekend---Scott Zinser and Jeanine Norden will provide the music and moves, you bring your energetic dancing and smiles, and we'll all have a great time!  Cupid sometimes can use a little help, so please tell your pals about our fun dances, too!
