### Coronavirus Update

The coronavirus situation is very fluid.  The state-wide indoor mask mandate is still in effect in Oregon.  As always, it is up to each individual club and facility to decide what restrictions make them comfortable.  Please
honor their wishes.

### Federation Meetings

The Federation board met in person at the Salem Square Dance Center on September 12, our first live meeting in 18 months.  Our new slate of officers was installed.

At this meeting, the board voted to hold the 2022-23 elections online as an experiment.  If that goes well, we'll make it permanent.  Note that, per our Practices & Procedures, the ballots will be sent to the club secretary.  PLEASE double-check to make sure that your club secretary contact information in the state directory is valid.

The next Federation meeting will be at the Linn County Fairgrounds for Mid-Winter Festival, Sunday, January 30, 2022.
