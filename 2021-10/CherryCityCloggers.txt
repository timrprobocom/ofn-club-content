Cherry City Cloggers really doesn’t have a lot of news to report. We have two relatively filled CoVid compliant classes going on at the present time and all are back to wearing masks and distancing on the dance floor. For those who like to take things a little slower
and more casual, we have the 4:00 p.m. class and for those who would like
to take it to the next level, we offer the 6:30 p.m. class. Glee Johnson is teaching our 4:00 class and Stacie does the 6:30 one.  

We plan to start the Intro to Clogging class Tuesday, September 14 at 5:45 p.m. but that will be dependent on the number of participants that have signed up. The lack of
being able to do demos this summer and really have people see what fun clogging is has hampered our being able to get the word out and create a desire for new people to come and join us. If anyone is interested in joining us, please check our website cherrycitycloggers.com to see if our intro class materialized and contact Mary Ellen Ramseyer, our president, about joining.  If this class materializes, I believe Mary Bray and Glee will be co-teaching this class.  Georganne Pfnister
