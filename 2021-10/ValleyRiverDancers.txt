The Valley River Dancers are sad to report that because of the increase in cases of Covid-19 with the new variant we have decided that our dances are canceled until further notice
 We will not be starting our Mainstream Lessons until at least mid-October or if the Covid situation continues to be bad, even January 2022.  As soon as it appears to be safe to resume dancing we will do so.
 For more information, contact us on our Facebook page:  Valley River Dancers - Newberg or through our email address at newbergdancers@gmail.com.
 Please everyone stay safe, well and healthy.  Hoping to see everyone on the dance floor soon.
