 The August TVC meeting was held via Zoom.  We will continue the Zoom meetings until at least October.  A new venue for our in person meetings has not been found.
 The TriCouncil dance on October 30th at the Kinton Grange is being hosted by the TVC with Darrell Kalmbach and KC Curtis calling with Tam Helms cueing.
 The TVC had a lengthy discussion about the future of the Summer Festival, and voted for the option of having the Federation host it with Council contributions.  Only held every other year on odd numbered years, the next Summer Festival will be in 2023.
 The 2021 Seaside Sashay was planned for October 22nd and 23rd, and Gary Clark mailed out ribbons to all who paid for last year’s cancelled weekend.  However, this year’s Sashay was cancelled due to the Covid situation.  Caller Ray Brendzy informed us that Canada has again closed its borders and it would cost him $200 each way for a Covid test to cross over and back.
 Many TVC clubs have changed their dancing schedule since last month with several delaying the beginning of their dancing.  See individual club reports below.
