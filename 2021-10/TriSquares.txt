Regarding our club's plan to begin dancing again in September, it's looking doubtful.  Some of our members (myself included) are not willing to attend large indoor gatherings right now - due to the increasing cases of the Delta variant, the hospital ICU's overflowing, the growing breakthrough cases infecting vaccinated people, and the long-term effects of Covid-19.
 One of our board members has many family members infected with Covid and knew a young lady (35) who recently died from it.  So is it wise to ask people to gather together to square dance at this time, or should we wait until later when it is safer?  Our board meets on September 7th to decide.
