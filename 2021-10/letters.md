title: Invitation to Boise Square Dance Hall
---
Greetings to all Oregon dancers!  I'd like to invite you to join us for a couple of upcoming dance events at the Boise Square Dance Hall.  In October we will be having the ISRDA Round Dance Festival, featuring Debby and Tim Vogt from Las Vegas, Nevada. This will be a great weekend of phase III thru V dancing, starting Friday night October 15, and ending with a phase V Waltz teach on Sunday.

In November The Fall Jubilee is happening with featured caller Andy Allemao from Chula Vista, California.  This will be a fun Friday and Saturday full of great energy dancing and good workshops.

Flyers for both these events are in the advertisements section below, with registration and schedule information.  If you have questions about the round dance weekend, you can contact Kathy Shaw at (208) 830-5870, and for questions about either event you can also contact Darlene Wooden at (503) 583-5473 or at my email:

We'd love to have you come join us on our great wooden dance floor.

Darlene Wooden
