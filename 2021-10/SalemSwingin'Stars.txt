We will continue to dance every chance we get! Face masks or face shields notwithstanding. Mainstream lessons began on Wednesday September 8 as well as Plus lessons later in the evening. Lessons will continue until mid-January. We are 
looking forward to seeing new and experienced dancers on the floor.

Our Annual Corn â€˜n Cluck dance was held on September 17. (This was the COVID version, so in lieu of corn on the cob and roasted chicken, the dancers were treated to bags of candy corn and wind-up chicken toys.) Fun was had by all who attended.

We would like to thank all the dancers from the Mid-Willamette Valley who continue to attend our dances on a regular basis. We would be quite lonely without you. Mark your calendars for our Spooktacular Halloween Plus Dance on Friday October 29. Costumes are highly recommended. A flyer will be posted soon. Check our Facebook page for details for each dance.
