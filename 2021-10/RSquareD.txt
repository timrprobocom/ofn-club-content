In August, R Square D decided to cancel the planned September dances and the start of lessons, due to the huge increase of COVID cases and the new Washington state mandate regarding masks.  As of this writing, no decision has been made about whether to dance in October.  If we do so, our “Back in the Saddle” dance will be Friday, October 8th and that will be our only October dance.
 Postponing dances is disappointing to many but the priority is for everyone to be safe.  Please check our web site www.r-square-d.info for more up-to-date information as it gets closer to October.
