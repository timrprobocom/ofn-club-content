After not having danced for a year and a half, due to Covid, it is time to make new plans for dancing again just  as many other clubs are doing . The process is still evolving. We had one dance in August and one in September.  We now have a new board. They along with our club membership, are in the process of making future plans for our club. We will let you know as soon as these plans are made. Stay tuned to our web site and the OFN. 

Happy Dancing,
Carol Mendenhall
