Greetings from the Toe Draggers.  This is a very discouraging report, Toe’s will be canceling both of our upcoming dances, September 17th, and October 1st.  Dances in November and December are currently on hold.
 Toes are continuing to keep in touch through Zoom.  Two of our members are recovering from break thru cases of Covid, all others are doing good as of this writing.
 “We need never be hopeless, because we can never be irreparably broken”  -  Albert Einstein
 Stay safe and sane. We WILL dance again!
