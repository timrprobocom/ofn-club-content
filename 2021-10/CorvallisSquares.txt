The Corvallis Squares had a potluck dinner in August and the plans were quite creative, with some sharing potluck dishes and some bringing their own meal. The potluck was followed by a club meeting, with the option of attending via Zoom if not there in person. This has been a season thatâ€™s required a lot of flexibility! Our club decided not to hold September dances and we are waiting to decide on our October dance. We wish you all the best as we wait to start dancing again! Karen
