Our Congratulations to our very own George Hermann who was installed as the new Federation President in September. 

Because we had too many conflicts with the Polk County Fairgrounds, we have changed the location of our lessons to the Salem Square Dance Center. The lessons started on September 12 and will run until mid-December.

I hope by the time you are reading this we have had a nice fall soaking rain, the dirt and smoke are washed out of the air and we are having crisp fall days! LaVerne
