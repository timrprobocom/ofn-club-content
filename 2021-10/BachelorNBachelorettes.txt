We’re very glad that things are seemingly getting back to normal, except for dine-in fast food places and square dance festivals.  Let’s all write them and urge them to get up to speed.

Some clubs are just starting to dance, but our club has been dancing for some three months.  You’re very welcome to drop in and see what we have to offer.

Our lessons started Sept 8th and are doing well.
