I do not like roller coasters.  You go up slowly, building suspense, then the world seems to drop out from under you.  This past year and a half has felt like a repeated roller coaster ride. The CRD's had an anniversary dance and then closed the doors.  We get ready to dance again and the Hazel Dell Grange shuts the doors.  But, as in a roller coaster, the ride hopefully comes to an end and you can open your eyes again. 
 We have a new home with a wonderful wood floor, great acoustics and Jim Hattrick calling for us.  As we go to press with this issue we are heading into a new, and hopefully, smoother ride.
 We invite you to come see our new home at the Manor Grange, located at the corner of 72nd Avenue and 179th Street.  From Interstate 5 take the County Fair Exit, turn right and go three miles east.  Coming North on 205, take the Padden Parkway exit west, turn right on to Andresen Rd.  It will turn into 72nd Avenue.  Stay on 72nd till you get to 179th. Hope to see you soon. 
 Columbia River Dancers will follow the Washington state guidelines regarding mask requirements at indoor dances.
