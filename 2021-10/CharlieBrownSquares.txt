We hope to start SSD lessons on Tuesday October 5th, after postponing class start from September. Mainstream FunShop and Plus classes are set to start on Thursday October 7th.

The executive board decided to cancel our Oct 2nd dance. We hope to be able to hold the Miles of Smiles weekend with Mike Seastrom October 15-17, and a decision will be coming soon.

We miss our dancers and regular dances and hope we can return to the dance floor soon!!
