Square Dance lessons were supposed to start on September 12 at the McMinnville Grange from 4:30 â€“ 6:00 p.m., but they have been postponed because of the statewide covid requirement for masks. Also, we canceled our September dance on the third Saturday for the same reason. We will be discussing later what to do for our October dance. Jennie
