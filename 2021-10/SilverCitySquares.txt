We have been helping the Waldo Hills Community Club with maintenance jobs over the summer (including painting). So now our hall has a "freshened look" inside. They still have some more work planned.

We will be dancing but anyone planning to attend one of our dances, please be aware that we will be following whatever current mask requirements are in place for each dance.Â For September, we had the enjoyment of dancing to KC Curtis and Julia Buchheit. We are looking forward to Bruce Lowther and Judy Russell in October and Ian Craig and Julie Stiers in November. Petrina Buchheit
