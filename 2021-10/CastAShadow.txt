We are not dancing at this time due to the surge in the Delta variant and so many of our members having underlying health issues.  We hope to resume our Sunday afternoon dances in Hall B at the Emerald Dance Center at 2095 Yolanda in Springfield as soon as it appears the surge has died down.  If you have any questions, please call Fred Beisse at 458-221-3564 (cell) or Gaynor Hintz at 541-741-4149.  When we do resume, we will again request that those who attend be fully vaccinated.

Hope to see you in a square soon,   
Gaynor Hintz
