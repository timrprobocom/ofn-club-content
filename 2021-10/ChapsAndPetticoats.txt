Chaps' first Intro to Square Dance lesson of the season was held SEPT 12th.  We had enough Angels to make three squares, however, we got our three (3) students into the squares and ran with two squares on the floor.  A nice problem to have...thank you Angels!  We have at-least double the student commitments for SEPT 19th - will share our success stories next time.

Chaps and Petticoats were dark for the July and August months.  We also elected to go DARK on SEPT 3rd (our first-Friday dance night) in favor of attending a Labor Day weekend dance (we had a square of Club members too) - however, the venue cancelled, electing caution instead, due to indoor/outdoor mask mandates and the COVID-Variant increasing numbers.  Cancellations were a common factor in the month of September.

On a positive note, a handful of C&P members have enjoyed Wednesday night dances at Bachelor and Bachelorettes and first & third Friday night dances at Salem Swinging Stars - the return of dancing has been a welcome experience for our feet and mental health too.  

Thank you to Independent Wagon Wheelers who hosted the Federation (quarterly) meeting and dance night.  George and Patty Hermann called & cued and invited visiting Callers and Cuers from the floor onto the stage - what fun and so cool, to experience tips and rounds with a bunch of out-of-area voices on the mic too.

Chaps and Petticoats will host a” Pirate” dance on October 1st, Scott Zinser/Tami Helms will call and cue.  Do dress the part as Costume Prizes will be awarded.  Our October 15th dance (no theme - casual OK) will feature Terry Halley/Caller and ‘little bit' Sandra Pinion/Cuer.  Keep posted on the COVID guidelines as mask/face shield mandates may still be in effect … but casual is a good reason to turn out! 

Sunday Lessons on October 17th, are 5:00-7:00pm followed by our third-Sunday dance at 7:00-9:00 - do come join us.

Happy Feet
Betty Chipps
