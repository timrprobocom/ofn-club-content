Here it is October already.  What a September it has been. I have called three dances (two for my home club Independence Wagon Wheelers), was installed as the president of the Oregon State Federation, started classes (teaching) and said goodbye to my friend and mentor, Lee Ashwill.

While some clubs have started back dancing, others are choosing to wait a few months.  I know it will be a slow build up. Many people are just not ready to come out and socialize. The clubs that are dancing are following the state guidelines for masks and hand sanitizer. It is hard to dance with the masks on, but we have shown over the past few months that square dancers can adapt and do what is necessary to keep our activity moving…

It will be an interesting year as president with all the restrictions. I am glad I will have Tim x2 (Keck and Roberts) to keep me on the right path. I also have the support of my loving wife, Patty, who knows when to “pull in the reins” when I get too far off track, too. 

Lee (along with Barbi) was a driving force for square dancing for many years. Not only on the club and state level, but on the national level. He will be missed by one and all.

Here’s hoping you all are staying well and following mask and sanitizer protocols. And soon we will all be “Back to Dancing”

George Hermann   
OFSRDC President 2021-2022
