This was written before the first class of the season started. We are having two classes this year. The first one is a step-up class for those who are ready to move up from Phase 2 to Phase 3 and we are starting with Rumba from 6:00-7:00 p.m. on Thursdays. The regular Intermediate class will be Waltz 3 review and moving on to Waltz 4, from 7:45-8:20 p.m. 

We had a comfortable dance in August for “It’s Almost Fall”. We are in the planning stages for another dance in October. At the moment, the tentative theme is “Don’t Match”. Stripes, plaids, strange socks, mismatched shoes, etc. Of course since it is Halloween month, costumes will be accepted also. Just something fun to get rid of the doldrums from all this virus stuff. 

We are always looking for visitors to come and share our dance floor at the Salem Square Dance Center on Thursdays. More than enough room for anyone who likes to dance at the Intermediate level. Marilyn Schmit
