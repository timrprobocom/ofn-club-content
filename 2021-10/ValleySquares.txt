Valley Squares dance is on Saturday, Oct 16, 7 to 9 (maybe 9:30) pm, Mainstream and Plus.  We will continue to dance the level of our dancers from 7 to 9 pm. 
 Until things change, please wear your mask.  Wearing a mask has not been as difficult as I had expected, I can still breathe while dancing. 
 See you in a square.
