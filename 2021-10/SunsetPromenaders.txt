Hi from the Sunset Promenaders and Promenaders Plus.  We had our Monthly Zoom Meeting in August 26th and as you probably already know the decision to cancel the Seaside Sashay was made because of the Covid situation.
 Other than that we are still dancing on the 1st and 3rd Saturday of the month, as well as Plus on the 1st and 3rd and 5th Thursdays of the month.
 As for the mandate from the Governor we are requiring masks or face shields at our dances. We will continue to monitor the rules that need to be followed and update you as needed. 
 All of our dances start at 7pm and end at 9:30 pm. We are going to start having cookies at our Saturday dances after the dance so our dancer's can have a little social time.  As of right now there will be no food at our Plus Dances, just lots of dancing.  Mike and Julie Stout will be back in our hall as Caller and cuer on Saturday dances starting in September.  Darrell Kalmbach and Tami Helms will continue the calling and cueing on Thursdays. 
 As a club we have been and are pretty active. On the 22nd of August we had our club picnic at Dan and Terri Browning's house and everybody had a great time with a great turnout. 
 On Saturday, October 2nd, we will be celebrating our 36th year with an Anniversary Dance at 7pm.  Mike, Julie, Darrell, and Tami are joining forces to call and cue the dance.  We are having an Ice Cream social after the dance at 9:30 pm.  You are all welcome to join us in this celebration.
 Times are tough with everything that is going on right now but we can be thankful that we live and dance where we do because there are those that are going through a lot worse times than we are.
 Stay Safe and hope to see you on the dance floor.
  Mike St.Clair
