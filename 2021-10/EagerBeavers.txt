The Eager Beavers have been dancing Plus every Monday since early June except for one cancellation on the day after the 115 degree day.  Our caller lineup remains Jim Hattrick, Daryl Clendenin, and Darrell Kalmbach.  Our cuer situation has changed with Yvonne Clendenin and Joyce Hooper both retiring.  We are excited to announce that Jeanine Norden has joined our family with Connie Clark helping us out on an interim basis.
 All of our members have been vaccinated and all visitors as well.  We keep an updated list and ask all attendees who are not on the list for proof of vaccination.  Proof of vaccination is a requirement to dance with the Eager Beavers. 
 We cancelled our Picnic due to Oregon mask mandate at outdoor settings.  For up to date information go to our website www.EagerBeavers.info.
