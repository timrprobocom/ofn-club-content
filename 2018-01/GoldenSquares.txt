Hello!  We hope you all are recovered from the hustle and bustle of the holidays and are ready to dance. We have had low attendance so hope that can change!  We will be dark on Monday New Yearâ€™s Day. We hope you all enjoy your holiday.

We do have a 5th Monday this month, which means we have a Pie Night Dance. We hope you will join us for a great night of dancing and pie. We start at 7 p.m. with pre-rounds cued by Jackie Gale, followed by Mainstream & Plus called by Randy Dibble.  Hope to see you in a square!  May you have a Blessed year. Happy New Year! Teija Danskey
