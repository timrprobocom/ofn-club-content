Another New Year to keep on dancing! Our club will start out 2018 with our first club dance on January 6th, but we will be dark the 4th Saturday to encourage our members to go to the Mid-Winter Festival in Albany. That is always such a fun time!

We will be offering round dance lessons starting in January with Tami Helms teaching waltz, phase 1 and 2, for beginners. This will take place at the Boring Barn from 7:00 to 8:30 PM on Sunday evenings starting January 14th. The cost will be $6 per lesson, or all ten lessons for $50 when prepaid.
 
Our mainstream lessons with Scott Zinser are going well, and several of our students have been attending the Jamborees. That extra floor time really helps their dancing skills. They will probably be graduating in February if the weather cooperates and we don’t miss too many lessons!

Stay tuned for more as we are hatching another Murder Mystery Dance in March. This time it is an original play written by square dancers. You will get an opportunity to figure out, “Who Blew up the Outhouse?” Details will appear in our next installment of the OFN.
