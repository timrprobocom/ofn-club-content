Happy New Year everyone! We have been attending the New Dancers' Dances with the students and it's been a fun and festive time. Our New Dancers' Dance is on January 13 and we look forward to it. Since our class of mainstream students was small, we combined lessons with the Albany Timber Twirlers and it’s worked out well.

Coming up in March is our annual Coast Trip, March 9 and 10, when we'll be dancing both nights at Gleneden Beach Community Club. All are welcome! I know it’s a tossup what kind of weather we’ll have, but the Oregon coast is a lovely spot even on a blus-tery day. Karen
