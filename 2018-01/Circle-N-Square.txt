We had a small problem and we did not have rounds for our Christmas dance.

Dean called a fun dance for our newer dancers and the plus dancers.  Everyone had a great time especially changing squares on the last tip.

We start back up with classes on January 8th.  Our next dance will be on Saturday, January 20th with our Winter Wonderland dance.  (Yes, Mary, we will have rounds).

Hope everyone had a Merry Christmas and a happy new year.
