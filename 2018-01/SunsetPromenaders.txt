The Seaside Sashay was a success again this year and we want to thank all the dancers that came.  The weather was fantastic, the dancing at the “Turn Around” was exceptional, the shopping was great, and the restaurants were outstanding, too.  Dan Preedy and Darrell Kalmbach teamed up together and did an outstanding job of calling, while Debbie Taylor did her usual excellent job of cueing including phase two through intermediate rounds.  There was much going on all weekend including “Treasure Hunt”, Mud Wrestling, and the split the pot drawing.  It was a fun activity all weekend thanks to all you dancers and good planning ahead of time by the Sunset Promenaders and the Hay Shakers organizers. Thank you dancers; it is all you being there, without you it would not be anything.
 Speaking of fun, our Promenaders Plus Third Anniversary on November 17th was a fun evening with Darrell Kalmbach and Ken Pratt calling and cueing.
 Hope you have some time in January to come and enjoy our dances.  The dances are January 4th Promenaders Plus Dance, January 6th a Sunset Promenaders mainstream dance with the theme of Wild West including cornbread and chili at the break.  Then on the 18th we have the Promenaders Plus Dance, and on Saturday the 20th the Sunset Promenaders are having a “Pajama” dance.
 Our mainstream lessons start January 7th at the Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall and are from 4PM to 6; the first lesson is free.
