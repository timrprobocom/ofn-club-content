Hi Everyone,

The Callers & Cuers "Midway" dance was a huge success. There were lots of "purple hearts" earned and everyone had a great time. There were 5 squares on the floor for most tips and probably 2 more sitting out. Everyone had a blast!.

We will revisit the first Tuesday meeting schedule in April and see how it is going. We will keep you posted.

PLEASE support the Council and the Clubs in the Rogue Valley. Everyone needs all the support they can get. Times are "skinny," so, please come out and help by supporting your local clubs.

The next Council meeting will be February 6, 2018 at Denny's Restaurant on Biddle Road at 430pm.

There are still "Learn to Square Dance" t-shirts available. We have found the t-shirts are a great conversation starter.
