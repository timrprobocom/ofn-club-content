Welcome a New Year with no mistakes in it yet.  The good news is that you may be smart enough not to repeat the mistakes you made last year and you are creative enough to try new things and make new ones.  Do not despair as these are called “learning opportunities”.  Now, don’t you feel better?
 We recognized and thanked the ten veterans who attended our Veterans’ Day Dance. I am especially glad to see the ones from WW2 who are still going strong.  These are the tough guys. 
 Members are talking about attending Mid-Winter Festival where they plan to see many friends from other clubs. 
 The Eager Beavers approved a motion made by Kathy Roberts that TVC clubs host or co-host upcoming 5th Saturday dances.  Details on respective responsibilities for each are being decided.  Seems like a good idea to me.  The 2018 New Years Eve dance will be co-hosted by Eager Beavers and Sunset Promenaders so you know it will be a good one. 
 After a very successful Plus Class earlier this year we are repeating our program starting at noon, February 5th, Monday, running into May. If you are thinking about learning or brushing up on Plus be ready to join us.  We will have the same three great callers giving the lessons: Daryl Clendenin, Jim Hattrick, and Darrell Kalmbach.  Please check for up to date information at www.EagerBeavers.info or OFN website: http://ofn.club.
 Happy New Year!
