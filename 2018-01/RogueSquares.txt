The Rogue Squares are still holding their own with the classes. We are solid at 3 students every week. We have a couple who attend 2 weeks on and off for 2 weeks. Phil is very pleased with their progress. We will be dark on Mondays for Christmas & New Years Day, but they should be able to pick it back up in a hurry without missing a beat.

We have had a great response to our "Angel Cards." One of the Angels said the other night, "I have 2 full cards (that's 2 dance passes), but I can't remember where I put them." That is a great support for our activity. Thanks to all who come out to help, especially the Rogue Squares and the Star Promenaders.

The Rogue Squares are sponsoring a new student dance on January 12 to encourage these new dancers to participate at something other than classes. This is our annual "Pajamarama." All clubs are invited to bring their class to this dance. The new student dancers won't have to worry about having "square dance" attire, just wear their "jammies." Phil Ramey will be the caller and Elaine Funk will cue the rounds. There won't be any Advanced dancing at this dance and the donation is reduced to $5.00 for this one time only.

We are really excited about the line-up of callers for the club dances for February and March. We will be dark in April for Pear Blossom.

See you in a square!!!
