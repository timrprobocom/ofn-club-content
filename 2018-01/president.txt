<p>I hope everyone enjoyed the holidays.&nbsp; Be sure to check out the special dance section in addition to the regular flyers this month when you look for a New Year&rsquo;s Eve dance to bring in the New Year with good friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end of January will bring Oregon&rsquo;s Mid-winter Festival.&nbsp; I hope most of you are planning on attending the festival this year.&nbsp; It kicks off with a Trails End Dance sponsored by the Emerald Empire on Thursday, January 25.&nbsp; Be sure to check out the flyer in this issue.&nbsp; Mid-Winter starts at 2:00 pm on January 26, in the Linn County Fair and Expo Center in Albany and continues through Sunday January 29. Mid-Winter has 6, yes I said SIX dance floors for your dancing pleasure! They have a separate hall for Mainstream w/ Rounds, Plus w/ Rounds, Advance, B-51, Clogging, and Rounds. There will be 2 featured International callers this year - Dan Preedy and Buddy Weaver. Both the featured round dance cuers TJ &amp; Bruce Chadd and the clogging cuers Russ &amp; Lelia Hunsaker have cued internationally. Their bios are available on the Mid-Winter website. <a href="http://www.midwinterfestival.com/callers.htm">www.midwinterfestival.com/callers.htm</a>.&nbsp; Mid-winter has something for everyone.&nbsp; There are dances, workshops, resale clothing, sewing clinics, educational seminars, a Round Table Discussion on, &ldquo;Looking for Fun in All the Right Places&rdquo;, a basket raffle, many youth activities throughout the weekend, and more! If you haven&rsquo;t purchased your ribbons, yet &ndash; don&rsquo;t delay.&nbsp; The price for your ribbons will go up on January 15.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope your New Year is happy and filled with good friends, good health, and a lot of dancing.&nbsp; I am looking forward to seeing everyone at Mid-Winter.</p>
