On November 12th we had our new dancers jamboree, and the next week we took our students to Chaps & Petticoats jamboree, too.
 December 3rd we had our club’s annual holiday dinner, this time at Yen’s Chinese Restaurant in Tigard, in a nice side room with no extra charge, with the crazy white elephant gift exchange of goofy gifts showing up again, year after year.  Very merry!
 On January 7th we begin ten weeks of Mainstream Lessons B52-68, on Sunday afternoons from 3:30 to 5:30 at the Tigard Grange.  All students and angels welcome.
 On January 13th, Saturday, we’re having a B-51 Dance and hope students come visit from all the other clubs.
 And we are gathering many raffle items together for our big anchor dance, the Mardi Gras Masquerade Ball, on Saturday February 10th.  Hope you all can come!
