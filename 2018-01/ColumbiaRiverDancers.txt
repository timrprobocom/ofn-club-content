 There is a saying that as you grow older, times speeds up.  Now while time is really not going faster we all of a sudden pause, shake our head and say, "What happened to 2017?  It was here a minute ago and now it is gone."  The Columbia River Dancers had a very good 2017 and are looking forward to an even better 2018.  We danced in the cold, we danced in the heat and we danced in the sand.  We have many new friends and the club is growing.  We ended up the year with Dan Nordbye calling our Turkey Burn-Off just after Thanksgiving, Mike and Julie Stout doing the honors on the 9th and rounding out the year on the 23rd of December with our caller/cuer, Jim Hattrick.  What could be better?
 If you know of friends or neighbors who would like to dance, the CRD start new lessons the first Tuesday of each month with Jim Hattrick as our teacher.  Encourage them to come and we will let them in free for that first lesson.  Hard to beat a deal like that!
 Once the Christmas tree is un-decorated and the gifts that were too small have been exchanged it is time to get out of the house.  On January 13th we will be at the Hazel Dell Grange again with Craig Abercrombie.  This will be a good time to brush off the cobwebs of the holidays and get ready for a great 2018 season.  Remember we dance Plus from 7 to 8 and Mainstream from 8 on with rounds in between tips.
 As has been the tradition in the past, the Columbia River Dancers will be dark on Saturday January 27th.  Many members of the club will travel to Albany to dance to national callers Dan Preedy and Buddy Weaver and cuers TJ and Bruce Chadd.  We look forward to dancing in a square with both old and new friends.  So, if you do not have your tickets, it is still not too late.
