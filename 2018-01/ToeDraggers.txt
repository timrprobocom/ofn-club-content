2018 Here We Come!  How time flies when you are having fun in the square dance world!!  November gave us a beautiful end to the fall season and beginning of all of our wonderful holiday celebrations.
 The Toes had a great canned food drive for November and December.  Thanks to everyone that helped the Toes out to feed families in need.
 The New Dancer’s Jamboree was fun to be able to help the new students gain more experience on the dance floor.  It’s a great time to meet and greet and help out our new dancing friends.  We all remember our beginning dances.
 Wanted to thank KC and Linda for giving the club a relaxed and enjoyable evening at the grange playing table games and eating snacks.  It’s been a great year of dancing with them.
 Hope many of you are able to get over to the TVC New Year’s Eve dance.  It’s special to be able to bring in the New Year with our square dancing friends.
 Our dances this month are on January 5th and 19th.  Come join us on the 5th for our Black and Blue Ball with the goal of “Dancing Till You Drop” night of fun.  January 19th is our regular dance of the month.
 Round dance lessons begin with Bev and Harlan Flint on January 7th at the Kinton Grange from 2 to 4 p.m.  We so appreciate Bev and Harlan.  They make dancing so much fun.
 We hope to see you at Mid-Winter Festival in Albany at the end of the month.
 We are already looking forward to our Ground Hog Dance and Sweetheart Ball in February.
 Hope to see you at many of our dances in the New Year.
