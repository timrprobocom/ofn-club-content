Our top news is that Jeanine Norden is again cuing, and she will be back to cuing for us regularly as of January 6th.  We really look forward to having her with us again.  Thanks to Dennis Smith and Tami Helms for filling in while she was gone.  
 We have been asked over the years about lessons. Starting in February we will have Plus lessons each dance night in the hour before the dance starts.  We would love to have more dancers joining us to enjoy Randy Dibble's calling.  More details will be out, both in this column and in flyers.  
 Other news is that we are planning on visitations to clubs who picked up our banners at our Birthday Dance.  More details will be available online and in flyers.  
 The last isn't new.  It's just a reminder that in inclement weather to check our website as to whether there's a decision on the afternoon of the day before our dance if weather will dictate canceling for safety's sake in unsuitable weather.  
 We hope to see you on our dance floor soon.
