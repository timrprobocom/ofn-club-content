We have finally selected a club caller and invite you all to come dance with us and help give a big welcome to our caller Darrell Kalmbach and his wife Erin. We dance every second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community Center at 42nd and Jackson in Milwaukie. 

Our club actively participates in visitations to other clubs each month. We believe that by bringing  dancers to visit other clubs, that we help support the clubs we visit and  help keep square dancing alive and well . We have a game we play when we do visitations. It is called “ the banner game.” Here is how WE play it. If you bring at least 8 dancers ( one square) to our club we will give you one of our club banners to take back to your club. Then we will bring at least one square to your club to get it back. Many times an added bonus is that dancers end up going to a hall they have never been to before and enjoy dancing with that club and caller and want to return and dance with them again . It is a win-win situation. There’s more. If we already have your banner and you come to get it bringing two squares (16) dancers or more you get your banner back plus one of our.  This only works if we have one of your banners. We will never give more than one of our own club banners at one visitation. This game knows no boundaries. You do not need to stay in your own council. We presently have banners from Valley Squares, Hoedowners, Silver Stars, Charlie Brown and BnB.  Our next visitation is to mid winter festival in Albany January 26, 27,28. We hope you will come and support this wonderful event.

See you in a square
