Our first Holiday Craft Fair was a huge success! In fact, it was so much fun that it will become an annual event here at the barn.  Many of the venders were so pleased that we have been asked to consider doing a Spring Craft Fair as well…we are considering this, so watch for flyers and news in the spring!

December 16th we celebrated our Christmas dance. It was fun to get together and enjoy the company of good friends. We started with a potluck and then Club members provided gifts for all of our youth dancers, and an Ornament exchange was organized for the adult dancers.  A jolly time was had by all!

We are looking forward to our December 30th dance with Scott Zinser.  The DC Line Dancing Group will be joining us as well, and instead of rounds between squares we will be learning some line dances.

We will bring in the New Year on December 31st with Chuck Simpkins and Neil Koozer. Pre-rounds with Neil will begin and 9:00 pm and squares with Chuck will start at 9:30 pm. The dance will be mainstream with every third tip plus.

Several new events will be happening in January. At our first dance we are having a Chili Competition. Phil Ramey will be calling and Cathy Houston Cuing. This dance will be on the 6th. Then on January 20th we will be having a “Stock the Shelves” dance. Dancers are being encouraged to bring things like toilet paper, paper towels, and other items used at the barn. In exchange for helping supply some of our barn necessities, dancers will receive $1 off their admission to the dance that night.

Remember… we are just a short drive south from the Portland area, so plan to join us in the near future. We dance the first and third Saturdays and always enjoy having visitors. We have members of all ages and are a family friendly club.


Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
