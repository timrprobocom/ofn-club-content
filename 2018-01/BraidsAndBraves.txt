We had a fun dance in November called by Bruce Lowther in Leonard's absence and. Sandra Pinion did a lovely job of cueing Rounds. We had enough for three squares. 

We are enjoying our new venue in Dayton and hope for more visitors as the Holiday Season really gets in gear. We hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving. We all have a lot to be thankful for, especially our Square Dance family. Carmen
