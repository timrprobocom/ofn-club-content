In this very well advertised dance of Nov 25, the Thanksgiving Bash, was one of the most memorable in history.  Although our council had nothing to do with it, the dance was held at the Oak Grove Community Club which is in our purview.  It was actually a combined bachelor and bachelorette party for the marriage of Mike Kious and his fianc√©e Camelia the next day. Caller, Hunter Keller (Billings MT); cuer Rikki Lobato (Grants Pass).

Despite five other clubs dancing around Portland, twelve squares showed up.  It was more like a regional dance festival with most people coming from out of town.  Attendees came all the way from Medford to Brush Prairie and from Bend to the ocean. Also evocative of a regional festival were the mixed level squares and rounds.  Split the pot was over $100. 

It left no doubt that Mike Kious can throw quite the dance party!
