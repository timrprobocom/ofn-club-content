Willamette Squares is enjoying the ongoing two step and square dance lessons. The club went dark in December but we will resume our regular schedule in January. We will be hosting the new dancer dance the afternoon of January 7 at 1:30 p.m. at the Salem Square Dance Center. We hope to see many familiar and new faces there!  As the song goes: "Make new friends and keep the old; Some are silver and the others gold."
 Willamette Squares welcomes three new members. Since Nancy and Brice Baker are no longer available, we have a new vice-president, Kevin Stanula and new lessons coordinator, Sherrie Stanula. Our other officers remain the same. Our president John Templin reports that after his procedure at OHSU it appears his pancreas is no longer giving him problems. He is happy to report he is relieved of the pain and that the stone that was causing him problems is no longer. Jodee Howard
