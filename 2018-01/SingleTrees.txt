We had our two regular club dances in November. The second Friday dance, being so close to Veterans’ Day, we used the theme Veterans’ Remembrance and asked members and other dancers to bring in photos of themselves or family members who had served in the military. We had a good response to this. Hattrick called a great dance for us as always and we had the added pleasure of having Mark Wheeler call a tip. Jackie Gale cued the rounds and had a floor full of round dancers.

On Saturday night, Nov. 11th, 14 Single Trees journeyed to Sweet Home to join the Squarenaders for their Turkey dinner and dance. How we love that homemade turkey with all the trimmings and all that pie too! They honored the veterans by having them come forward and get their pictures taken as a group. That was very stirring for everyone.

Our last dance of the month was to be called by Mike Halley but at the last minute he was unable to make it having moved to California earlier this year. So we asked Mark Wheeler to call for us and were very delighted to find out he could carry a whole dance, has a great stage personality, fine choice of music and a great singing voice.  What a package! We’ll be sure to have him back for our 2018-19 dance year. We were a bit disappointed by a small turnout but many were away for the Thanksgiving holiday or just couldn’t feature dancing after all those calories the day before. We will rethink offering a dance on this night even though we are the only dance on the 4th weekend of the month in this area.

We are all looking forward to January, 2018. We will only have one dance that month, but it will be a good one for sure with Jim Hattrick calling. Many of us will be going up to the Albany fairgrounds to dance at Mid-Winter on the 4th weekend.  We hope to see many of our friends from around the state and the Northwest dancing up a storm.  Happy New Year!
