<h2>Ferrous &amp; Karen Steinka<br>

<p> Ferrous and Karen Steinka are a shining example of the special spirit
of the square dance community.

<p> Their square dancing journey began in 1980 with the Tualatin Twirlers.
Over the years, they have had the privilege to dance with Daryl Clendenin's
Columbians, learned round dancing from Joyce Hooper, spanned the 30 years
of Norm Yoder's Plus Knights, joined the Eager Beaver's mid-day club, and
reunited with Daryl Clendenin with the Hoedowners.  Ferrous and Karen have
visited every club in the TVC.

<p> Karen and Ferrous have chaired special dances, mystery trips, lessons,
and club officers and board members.  Working with Tony Haskins, they
coordinated and organized TVC dancers and callers for the Oregon State Fair
for 5 years.

the TVC Council Delegates, OFN Area Editors, and co-authored the rewrite of the
TVC Constitution, By-Laws, and Practices and Procedures, and the Delegates
Introduction.

hours of effort in computing.  They compiled and formatted the TVC
directory.  They created, hosted, and now maintain 9 different web sites
for clubs from the TVC, PAC, Blue Mountains and Mid-Willamette councils.

"Find a Dance Club" and "Find a Hall" web site for Oregon and Southwest
Washington.  As Tim Roberts wrote on the Federation web page, "Ferrous
Steinka of the Hoedowners has created a web site that contains maps to
virtually every function in Oregon and southwest Washington that has been
used for a square dance in the recent past.  This is quite a valuable
resource."

Outstanding Contributions.  In 2015, they were awarded the Eager Beavers
Swenson Award for "Continued Outstanding Support of the Club and
Consistently Promoting Square and Round Dancing in the Community."
