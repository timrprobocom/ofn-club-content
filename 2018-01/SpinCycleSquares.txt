We are always so blessed to have Kris Jensen call for us when she is visiting her brother, sister-in-law and mother who live here in Eugene.  She is also asked to call for Cast-A-Shadow, our advanced group, when she's here. 

We dance almost every Sunday at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.  5:30 - 8:00.  All levels.  Come join us.  It's FUN!  Please go to our "When and Where" page to make sure we are dancing.  This is always kept up to date.  Thanks!

We are enjoying have a few more dancers join us Sunday nights.  Janet Geiger, an upcoming caller called a tip last time and did a fine job.  Janet really works at her calling skills, and it shows. 

Please come join us any Sunday night at the hall in Springfield at 5:30.  We continue to enjoy all of the amenities the hall provides which includes closet space, cupboard space, a hard-wired speaker system, cushioned wood floor, etc.  We are lucky to be here. 

Happy Dancing,
Christina Corelli, Member-at-Large
