<h3>Insurance Updates</h3>
<p>Markel Insurance, who is the underwriter for the liability insurance we get through USDA, has changed the layout of their insurance certificates, and that change is already causing some confusion.</p>
<p>The form now lists the USDA central insurance coordinator, Pat Inglis, as the "point of contact" for insurance issues, and not the Federation's Insurance Chairman, <a href="mailto:rogers3045@comcast.net">Kay Rogers</a>.&nbsp; Despite this change on the form, the procedures have not changed.&nbsp; Kay is still your first point of contact.&nbsp; When you have a claim or an insurance issue, you should always go through Kay, and Kay will contact Pat.</p>

<h3>Federation Meetings</h3>
<p>The Federation's next executive board meeting will be at Mid-Winter Festival, January 28, 2018.&nbsp; Stay tuned to learn about the Education Seminar that will be presented at Mid-Winter.</p>
