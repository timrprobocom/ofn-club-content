December is always a busy month for the Hoppers, and this year is no exception.  We collected toys and gifts for a non-profit organization that serves children and families in need of assistance.  For many years following the local Walk and Knock Food Drive our club has helped a food bank, FISH of Vancouver, sort the food into categories such as:  soup, vegetables, pasta, etc.  Laughter and good natured teasing makes our time go quickly as we work together to do something for our community.  Finally, our New Year’s Eve committee members have been working hard to put together a great evening for our members and guests.  The theme this year is “Come Sail Away.”  We are excited to have the Front Porch Trio: Jim Hattrick, Craig Abercrombie, and Adam Christman, calling and cueing.  We’re looking forward to a scrumptious dinner that is being catered by a local catering company.  All in all, we know it will be a great evening.

	January will see our club members getting ready for Mid-Winter Festival in Albany.  Not only do we enjoy dancing to some terrific callers and cuers, but we also appreciate the time we have to renew friendships with dancers we may see only at special events.  We’re looking forward to seeing many of you there.
