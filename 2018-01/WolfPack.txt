Our B-51 and Mainstream combo dance on December 2nd was a lot of fun. Door prizes were handed out to five lucky dancers. We had a couple guest callers in the house. Lennie Ludiker and Janet Geiger called a tip in addition to our own Sandy Harris and Christina cueing rounds.
Lessons are going well and new dancers will soon be graduating (December 15th) with a new class starting in January.
Hope you can make it to our Plus/Mainstream dance on the first Saturday in January.
Looking forward to seeing everyone at Mid-Winter.
