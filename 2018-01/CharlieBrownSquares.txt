The Charlie's celebrated their 50th birthday on Dec 2nd! What a wonderful party it was!! Charlie Robertson was so much fun and the rounds were great with Steve Murphy! Thank you to all that came to help us celebrate this wonderful milestone!!  We had about 80 dancers I believe.  Our Chocolate Christmas Affair Dance was small, but I am sure those that were there enjoyed dancing to Chuck!!
We have guest caller J Domis on Jan 6th with Mary Nutt cueing. On January 20th, we welcome back Richard Lane and Steve Murphy.  Please note the flyers for new times during the winter months (Jan-Mar). Let us know what you think.  
New classes start Thu Jan 11th at 630.  Our Sept class is still going strong on Tuesdays, followed by a Mainstream Workshop. 
January also brings MidWinter Festival in Albany - always a great time!!
Enjoy your holidays & see you in a square soon!
