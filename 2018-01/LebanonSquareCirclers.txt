We had great dances in November and our New Dancer/Toy Drive Dance on December 2 was super. Our caller is Charlotte Jeskey and our cuer is Jackie Gale. Our club visited Sweet Home Squarenaders for their Turkey Dinner Dance with Jim Hattrick calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  It was a wonderful evening. 

As usual, the Lebanon Square Circlers participated in the community lighting display at Ralston Park and we had our Christmas potluck on December 16. We always love to have visitors for our dances and we especially hope to have a large crowd on Sunday, January 21 for our 69th BIRTHDAY DANCE. Charlotte Jeskey and Jim Voll will be calling and Jackie Gale cueing. Of course, strawberry shortcake will be served at the break. See you in a square! Marilyn York
