IWW Mainstream students continue to do great at our Sunday afternoon lessons, with a committed group of angels sharing their enthusiasm and expertise (Many thanks, an-gels!).  We honored the class at a spaghetti feed and experienced clothing sale at our November 19 class. 

 A group of IWW hearty souls made a trek to the Oak Grove Community Center on No-vember 25 to dance to the calling of national caller Hunter Keller. Salem Swinging Stars hosted the season’s first beginner dance at the Square Dance Center on November 26.  It was a rousing success – a great turnout, lots of enthusiasm, and good dancing by the students at their first real dance.

Sunday afternoon Plus workshops continue to challenge a small but dedicated group to hone Plus and DBD skills. Our exceptional November 4 dance with a Salem Swinging Stars visitation and a total of 44 visitors was followed by a touching tribute to veterans at our November 11 Veterans’ Day Dance. By press time we expect to have enjoyed a festive Christmas Dance. 

We hope that you had a wonderful holiday season, and that you have a happy, fulfilling, healthy, and dance-filled New Year. Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays at the Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall. Dee and Bert Mackaman
