On November 10th R Square D hosted a Veterans Appreciation Dance.  There were six squares.  We had a visitation from the Buzzin Bees.  KC Curtis and Darrell Kalmbach assisted Craig with a couple of tips.  Because of traffic issues on the Lewis & Clark bridge Craig was a few minutes late getting to the dance.  Thank You to our cuer Lonnie for getting the dance started with rounds.  
 November 1st and 2nd we served coffee at the South bound Toutle Rest area.  It is always fun to chat with the travelers, many have a square dance story to tell.
 Our dance on the 25th featured Gospel music. Our caller and cuer kept us dancing to a lot of good gospel music.  Thank you Craig and Lonnie.
 We will be starting beginner lessons again on January 3rd.
 We will be dancing on January 12th, and serve warm winter soups at break.
 Our dance on January 27th is cancelled so that our members can attend mid winter.
For more information about us please visit our website at www.r-square-d.info or friend us on Facebook.  Our caller for R Square D is Craig Abercrombie and our cuer is Lonnie Sycks.  
 Happy New Year to one and all.
