Our next scheduled dance date is December 31, New Year's Eve.  Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli are in charge of this dance and invite any callers or cuers who attend to call and/or cue.  Everyone is encouraged to bring a pie.  Wow, can you believe it'll be 2018?   Please join us at 8:30 for Pre-Rounds.  Mainstream with every third tip Plus starts at 9:00.  We'll celebrate New Year's Eve in each time zone: New York City, Chicago, Ontario, Oregon and then Eugene/Springfield.  Wow, that's a party!  We'll dance a tip January 1, 2018 as well to welcome the new year.  

We have an active New Dancer's Class in our area right now which is a huge plus.  We encourage all dancers to support the new dancers and all of our wonderful clubs.  Sandy Harris has been doing these lessons and is doing a great job! 

Happy New Year!

Keep em' dancing,
Christina Corelli, Secretary of CCCA
