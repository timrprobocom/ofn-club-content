The club has finished the Phase 3 moves in Intermediate Waltz and is working on Phase 4 moves. The class is coming along really well.
Since this article will come out before New Yearâ€™s Eve, we are still putting finishing touches to the party starting at 8:30 p.m. We are hoping that you are planning to attend and  will join us in the fun and fellowship that will be shared for the evening.
We will hold a board meeting just prior to the publication of this article that will include planning on the next class and discussing our schedule to see what we can do to draw more to our class and membership.
We had guest cuers for the last two Thursdays of December. Hope you were able to come and share the talent. Looking forward to seeing you there.  Marilyn Schmit
