It has been a fun year so far with lots of special theme dances. Our Pirate Dance was a  huge success, as usual. We just had our New Dancers dance with a good turnout of new dancers and hard badges. Our class is small but having a great time.
We will be holding a New Yearâ€™s Eve dance along with the other clubs in our Alliance (Corvallis, Sweet Home and Lebanon) Look for flyer with all the information coming soon.
 
Come join us for fun dancing and nice people every first and third Fridays at 738 SE 5th (IOOF HALL) Albany. Sandy
