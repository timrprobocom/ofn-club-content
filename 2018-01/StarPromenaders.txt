Well here it is 2018................sounds like a date from Dick Tracey's Wrist Radio from an eon ago.  Well it is now and is filled with dancing for another whole year.  Starting with new, New Dancer classes in our hall and ending with New Year's Eve here also.

             The New Dancer class will be on Sundays from 6PM to 8PM starting January 10, 2018 and will be taught by Phil-Billy.  He will also be teaching a Mainstream workshop on Wednesdays with some plus (Not a class)....just practice for all involved.  And on Thursdays he will continue the September New Dancer class in Wayne's absence.  He will also be calling our Mainstream/Plus dances for the first quarter of 2018.       

            Our monthly meetings will continue to be on the second Thursday at 5:30PM (Except September which is always on the first Thursday.)  Our dances will continue on the second and fourth Saturdays.  Mainstream/Plus on the second Saturday and A/Plus on the fourth Saturday.

             Then we can consider Midwinter and Birthday Dances (Ours is the fourth Saturday in February)   and Pear Blossom and Boatnik and Port Orford and Summerfest and All the California weekends and Diamond Lake and Wayne's Retirement Party in August and bunches of other events scattered thru the year!!!!!!!  Fliers and reminders will be posted here in The Circulator, so keep your subscription up to date.

             Welcome to 2018 and Happy Square and Round Dancing all year round  er  square  er  long.....
