All I can say is that I'm glad we're not trying to dance in this!!!
But we did have a lovely picnic one evening in August while respecting the social distance.

And last Monday Jim Hattrick was on deck via zoom to call one couple squares for "Let's Keep Hoppin'" with Tom and Liza Halpenny as hosts.  I'm sorry that we missed it---we were out of town.  But we'll see him and the rest of our square dancing friends this coming Monday evening.  

Very sincere condolences to all who are being displaced by this terrible fire season.  So thankful people are bringing resources together all over the NW to help.

Stay safe and breathe---shallowly.
