Still no indication when we might begin Square Dancing as usual but some are doing more Round Dancing and some are trying the single couple Square Dancing. I know I'm not the only one missing the friendly faces and warm hugs, and the festivals that won't be. We just keep following the health guidelines and learning new ways to stay connected as life changes; waiting for the time we can get squared up again. Happy Trails until then. Carmen
