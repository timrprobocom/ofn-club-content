 The Winona Grange in Tualatin has just turned 125!  Unfortunately, due to the Covid 19 pandemic, the party that they had planned has been postponed and they have decided to wait to reschedule it at a later date.  The Winona Grange is the place we’ve called “home” for the last 35 years and they have been very good to us.  We’ll look forward to that belated special celebration but we won’t wait until then to send them our good wishes and hopes for many more years to come.  
 Happy Birthday Winona Grange!  
 We will keep you updated on calendar changes thru this OFN report as well as our website:  www.mixandminglesquares.org
