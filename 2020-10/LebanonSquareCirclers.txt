It’s been such a long time since we’ve been out on the dance floor with everyone.  However, our club has had several gatherings – one at Ralston Park in Lebanon.  It was a time for visiting and we observed social distancing. Our club also had a gathering/club meeting/potluck at Frank and Marianne Cawrse’s farm on Sunday before Labor Day.   We’re looking forward to the time we can meet you all on the dance floor. Our members are all doing well. Hope you all stay well! Marilyn York
