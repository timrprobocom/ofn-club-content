Needless to say this has been a year unlike any other year for all of us. Dancing came to a halt for most of our clubs in late March or April due to COVID 19  and government guidelines concerning group gatherings and social distancing. . Our club has not yet resumed dancing and we are waiting until we can be assured that it will be both safe and allowed by our state regulations.  

We are now being affected by fires, smoke and unhealthy air quality. Some have evacuated to safer locations. River City Dancers have been emailing and phoning members to keep in touch and just recently had a social meeting on Zoom. We discussed having zoom gatherings twice a month just to keep in touch. It was mentioned that we will probably need refresher classes when we are able to dance again. Several members spent time this summer fixing up our hall doing much needed repairs and re decorating. We are fortunate that we have a steady renter using our hall which helps support the hall.

We miss our fellow square dance friends and know that this is a difficult time for all of us. We hope that you will stay well and safe. Let us all pray for better days ahead.
