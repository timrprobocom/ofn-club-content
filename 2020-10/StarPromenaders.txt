The Stars are still in a holding pattern.  We are trying to overcome the smoke.  We will be having a benefit "something" for the dancers who have lost their homes in the fires in Southern Oregon.  At this point, mostly monetary donations, since they have no permanent place to store "Stuff".  We are grateful that our hall was spared in the fire.
