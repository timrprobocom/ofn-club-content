Even though this article is for the October issue of the OFN, I am reporting on August happenings. We had a special Saturday afternoon round dance event with Randy Lewis with nine couples in attendance. It was a nice relaxed afternoon of dancing to Phase 2-3-4 level dances. There was enough spacing for everyone and there was a candy dish and lemonade to enjoy.

The club accepted the resignations of the club cuers for the last two years, Stephanie Lozano and Leonard Snodgrass, effective on August 31, 2020. The club has signed Randy Lewis to a four month contract to the end of December. Starting on September 10, he is teaching Bolero. We are looking forward to seeing some familiar faces along with some new ones for the class.

We start dancing at 7 p.m. now and dance until 9:30 p.m. See our flyer in the Sept. issue of the OFN. It will give you our schedule. Hope you will get to come and see us and join in on the fun and camaraderie of the dancers. Marilyn Schmit
