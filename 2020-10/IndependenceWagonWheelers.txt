The IWWPPA (Independence Wagon Wheelers Past Presidents Assoc.) had a small gathering to officially welcome Terry McCarty to the club. Terry graciously volunteered the use of her back yard and we were very careful to remain socially distant. How strange to not have the usual hugs. This is the first time we haven’t had a potluck at the gatherings, but maybe one of these days’ things will get back to normal and we can still do that. 
Of course, we don’t even talk about getting back to dancing; don’t know when that will be but our members sure are anxious to get started. We may all have to take lessons again; hope we have good memories! Stay safe and stay well. LaVerne
