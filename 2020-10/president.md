As I write this, Oregon is dealing with wild fires and winds that have raised havoc with life and property.  Air quality is poor and affects breathing and many other things.  I’m sure many square dancers have stepped up to volunteer to help family, friends and neighbors through these troubling times.  May we all keep the faith that times are going to get better.  Pray for all those who have lost their homes and property.  Along with the pandemic we are in this together.

As we all look forward to getting back to dancing we have many hurdles to get over first.  There will be some changes in how we do things and I think we are all flexible enough to accept these challenges.  Many festivals and weekend events will be cancelled or rescheduled.  Speaking of rescheduling, if you have a festival coming up in your area and the timing is not right to hold it, think about rescheduling it at a later date if the logistics can be worked out.  We will need those dancing opportunities once the green light is turned on that we are now safe and don’t have social distancing guidelines any more.

Keep a connection with your club to make sure all members that you don’t see are safe and in good health.  Texting, emails and phone calls are all good to keep connected.  Social media is also good.

I have picked a theme of “Swing Your Partner”.  We all miss that as it was taken for granted when we were dancing all the time.  Do it in your home often to keep in practice.  Then do virtual swings with others you are close to.  Send a virtual hug once in a while.

These are sure changing times and we will get through this together and our dancing community will have a different look as long as we can accept any changes.
