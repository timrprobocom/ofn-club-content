The Country Cut-Ups want to extend their thoughts and prayers to those suffering through these unprecedented times of the corona virus pandemic and now the worst fire season that Oregon has seen.  Some Cut-Ups have been forced to evacuate, including our club presidents, Robert and Young Lumsden from their home in Eagle Creek, near Estacada.  Even our club workday for replacing some of the roof on our club-owned barn had to be postponed because of the fires and smoke.  Our Round Dance Class has continued with some interruptions on Sunday nights and of course, square dancing is still on hold indefinitely.  Our annual Pancake Breakfast Fundraiser that is held in October each year is cancelled this year.  Everyone stay safe and we look forward to seeing you at the barn sometime soon.
