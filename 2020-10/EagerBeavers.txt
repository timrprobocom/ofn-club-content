 Do you remember seeing the cartoons where a monk type figure is carrying a sign telling us  “THE END IS NEAR’?  There is more than one way to interpret that.  Is the world being destroyed or does it mean the present crises is ending soon.  Since I am an optimist I bet on the latter.  How about you?  I just want to go back to dancing and catching up with all my friends.  So, everyone, do your part and wear a mask to protect yourself and your friends from the virus.  I am not too crazy about being the first in line to test a vaccine.
 While you are not out dancing take a look at what it going on in the political world.  Be careful to make sure young children are not in the room.  Some of the language used is not fit for person or beast.  Some people I would not even invite to my bar-b-q and I certainly would not vote for them.  But voting is important.  I do care about the options and I never agree 100% with anyone but I figure the 80/20 rule a pretty good one to follow.  If I can agree 80% of the time I might vote for them.  So, consider your options, do not believe the pundits who get paid for their opinions, and sometimes listen to people who disagree with you.  Sometimes even I learn something. 
 Wish I had the magic wand to magically wave the virus away so I could see all of you out dancing.  Keep checking for our start date at www.EagerBeavers.info.
