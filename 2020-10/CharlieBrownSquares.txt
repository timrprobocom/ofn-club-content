We are still not dancing and miss all of our dancers and interactions. We hope everyone is doing well.  We will not have new dancer classes in September; and hope that we can have them in January. Our only dance originally scheduled in October has been cancelled.  Watch for updates on our website and Facebook page for any info on scheduled November events.
