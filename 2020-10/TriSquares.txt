 Tri Squares members had a "jamboree" on August 17th, over Zoom.  (Who would have ever imagined all this a year ago?)  Many of us participated and talked with each other, while our member Charles McAuley regaled us with his wonderful songs on the acoustic guitar.  Normally in August we would have been picnicking together at a beautiful park while he softly played his music, so it elicited pretty nice memories, and it was great to see each other and to catch up.  Here's hoping that next summer we can all be picnicking and dancing together again.  Think positive!  Keep those muscles working!  And be safe!
