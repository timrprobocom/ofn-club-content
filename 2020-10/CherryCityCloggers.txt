Unfortunately, there is nothing planned at this time for resuming clogging classes.  It was thought that we would be able to start back up in September. But with the Governor extending the State of Emergency into November, we will not be able to resume classes until things change.  It was also decided that we would obviously not be able to have a new beginner class for September.  Until we can have more than 10 people in the Square Dance Center at any given time, classes of any kind will not be able to resume.  Some cloggers are continuing to practice at home using online resources. At this point, our main goal once we resume classes will be to reconnect and maintain or regain the cloggers we have.
