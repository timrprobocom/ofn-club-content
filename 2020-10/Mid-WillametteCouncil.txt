Mid-Willamette Area Council is continuing to do business. Maybe not in the traditional way, but we are still up to date on items that need to be taken care of. There is only one club dancing in the council, ReVuNQ. (See their article below.)

The May Council meeting was held via email and dealt with various items that needed attention. In addition to their club reports, the club delegates were to respond to the items listed. We elected officers, got a count of directories, information needed for the next state meeting, and any other item that could not wait. The area directory is ready to be sent to the club delegates. The club reports were included in minutes that were produced and sent out. There was not much happening during the summer and we will meet in September to quickly install officers, distribute state directories, and have a small insurance training session when the new renewal papers are distributed. 

So, even though there is not much happening, business does continue to be taken care of in a timely manner.
