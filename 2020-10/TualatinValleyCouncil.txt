Although the TVC has not had an actual meeting, we are still active to the extent that restrictions allow.  One of our clubs is round dancing with strict requirements.  Hopefully there will be an approved vaccine by the end of the end of the year and restrictions will decrease.
 Some clubs were struggling before the pandemic and are now faced with potential financial problems.  All clubs and councils have fixed costs; annual corporation renewal, insurance requirements, internet domain costs, and Federation or Council fees, to name a few.  Club members may want to renew their membership, even if we are not  dancing, to support your club.  Your board members need to continue with the tasks of being a business even when we are not dancing.
 Remember, the "Seaside Sashay" to be held in late October and hosted by the TVC Promenaders and Hayshakers had to be cancelled due to Covid-19 concerns.  
 Happy Halloween or maybe not, since there will be no trick or treating.   Please stay safe until we can meet on the dance floor again.
