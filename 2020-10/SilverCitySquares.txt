Unfortunately, we are not dancing yet. But we have started having some Zoom meetings so that we can talk to club members face to face via computers and phones. We are doing separate meetings for our adults and our youth.

Right now, the teen festival is still being planned to happen (we really hope so!!) Not much else to report right now. Petrina Buchheit
