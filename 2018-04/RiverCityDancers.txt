All the cold winter weather did not keep us from kicking up our heels and having fun on the square dance floor in February and March. Ian Craig was our guest caller for our first dance in March on March 10 and our second dance on March 17 was our fabulous fifties dance complete with saddle shoes , poodle skirts and bobby socks for girls and the guys dressed as “ cool dudes “. Our annual fifties dance is always a lot of fun. Our own Darrell Kalmbach was calling.

We are trying something new for the month of April regarding our dance schedule. We will be starting with plus from 7-7:30 PM with pre-rounds in between the tips. We will have Mainstream from 7:30. - 9:30 with a short and simple break at 9:30. The dance will end after the break. This is an experiment to see if our dancers and members like this schedule. We will vote on whether to adopt this as our regular schedule at our May club meeting. Meanwhile this is just for April until further notice so stay tuned.

We are also out visiting other clubs and welcome all dancers to come visit us. We dance all year every second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community Center at 42 Nd and Jackson in Milwaukie. Darrell Kalmbach is our caller and Tami Helms is our cure. We love visitors.
