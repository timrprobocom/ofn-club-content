So many clubs have members that travel in the winter we are thankful to have such positive support from so many.  We had 6, maybe more, clubs represented at our Valentine's dance on February 9th.
 We had 4 squares dancing which included a visit from the St Helens club for our B 51 dance on February 24th.  Craig also calls for them
 Come celebrate with us on April 13th for our 65th Anniversary dance.  Plus and advanced rounds from 7-8, then Mainstream with rounds 8-10.  Happy 65th Anniversary R Square D!!
 On April 28th we are DARK.  Please support Yakima Spring Sashay or Salty Sashayers. 
 For more information about us please visit our website at www.r-square-d.info or friend us on Facebook.  Our caller for R Square D is Craig Abercrombie and our cuer is Lonnie Sycks.
