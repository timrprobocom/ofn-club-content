The club’s April 14th dance will feature caller Janienne Alexander and cuer Connie Clark in Garibaldi.
 Garibaldi is nine miles north of Tillamook on US 101.  City Hall has a huge second-floor dance hall built for the old Firemen’s Balls.  The club has had square dances there since the building was built in 1948.
 The Wednesday night square dance classes resumed on January 4th at the downtown Tillamook Elks Lodge.  These lessons are FREE and are taught by Joe Wrabek from 6 to 8pm.
