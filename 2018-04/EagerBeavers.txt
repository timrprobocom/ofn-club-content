 Can it be Spring already?  I am still eating Valentine candy and I have not taken down the lights on the roof.  My lawn is a hayfield.  Help!
 At noon, February 5th, we started our ever popular Plus Classes.  By May you will see new plus dancers coming to your club.  Welcome them; remember you were once a newbie too.  If you are a new dancer do not give up.  I had to take mainstream twice to feel like I knew what I was doing and I still make mistakes with plus.  
 Our King and Queen of Hearts were Lane Clem and Sally Duyck.  They each received a box of chocolates and the honor of planning the dance next year.
 Lane Clem is one of our newest callers and has started a small MS class in Oak Hills.  He also has been working at Beaverton Lodge with people in walkers so they can enjoy square dancing too.  I need to see how he does this.  I guess if people can dance on horses they can find a way.  
 We had nineteen Eager Beavers visit the Hoedowners for their Anniversary Dance and chicken dinner.  We visited with friends from other clubs although sometimes we did get a little too noisy during the round dances.  Thanks to the Hoedowners for a really good time and an excellent chicken dinner.  
 April 15th is our Anniversary Dance and all are invited to come celebrate with us. We will be dancing  Mainstream with a half hour Pre Plus.  Come get your ambassador form signed.  Dancing starts at 1:00 and Chicken dinner is served at 3:30 PM.  Come to Hillsboroâ€™s IOOF Hall second floor and if necessary there is a slow elevator.
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:15 to 3:00 pm, at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
