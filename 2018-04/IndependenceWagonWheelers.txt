The outstanding 2017-2018 IWW Mainstream Class graduated on February 18. Many of them have already been to their first Mid-Winter Festival, and we look forward to their contribution to the square dance community. Congratulations graduates!  Also, many thanks to the angels who added so much to the students’ learning experience.

As we compose this newsletter, we are looking forward to our March 10 Birthday Dance, celebrating 58 years. We hope that many of you will have joined us to help us celebrate. 

Be sure to join us for our “Kentucky Derby Dance” in May and for our regular dances on the first and second Saturdays at the Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall.  Dee and Bert Mackaman
