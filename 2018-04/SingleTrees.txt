February 9th we celebrated our 54th birthday with a wonderful visitation by the Independence Wagon Wheelers who brought along their caller George Hermann and his wife Patty.   This visitation of 17 strong really added to the fun.  We were perplexed when we could not find their banner to return to them.  They took home one of our instead.  Jim Hattrick, George Hermann, Mark Wheeler, Patty Hermann and Jackie Gale called and cued a great dance for us .  There was plenty of birthday cake for all.  We shall have to plan a visitation up to Rickreal to retrieve our banner soon.
 
On February 23 we held our 4th Friday dance with Craig Abercrombie calling and Jackie cueing.  While we had a very small turnout, Craig really poured it on and made the dancing challenging and great fun.  As always he chose just the kind of music we could all enjoy—giving us a choice at one point between Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga.  That night at a special meeting during the break we voted for officers and delegates for the 2018-19 year.  Larry Reetz will remain as president, but we now have Don Schimonitz stepping into the Vice President’s shoes.  Thanks to both and all the others willing to step forward and keep our club running smoothly. 
 
We are looking forward to fun club dances in April including the special dance to be held on Tuesday April 10 with Dan Nordbye calling.  We’ll be seeing more of Dan as he has now moved to Portland.  Jim Hattrick will be calling our second Friday dance and Jim Voll our 4th Friday.  Please come and join us.  Snowbirds will be back, and we hope the flu season will have abated.
