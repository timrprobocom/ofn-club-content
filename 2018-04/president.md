Spring has finally arrived and I am so happy!  I love the bright cheerful colors and warmer weather that spring brings our way.  Speaking of bright and cheerful, please take a moment to look at all of the flyers our clubs and councils submit each month. I am continually impressed with the variety of dance themes and great flyers our clubs and councils post.  They are all unique and creative and do a great job representing your clubs and your dances.

During our last state meeting, Dave and Patty Cooper introduced us to a new Oregon Ambassador, Rocky Yellow Rocker.  Rocky is a small traveling rocking horse who would like to travel around the state of Oregon attending all of your special dances. However, he needs your help to travel.  It appears his last visitation was to the Charlie Brown’s graduation.  If you would like Rocky to visit you, please check out his Rocky Yellow Rocker Facebook page and arrange with the last club he visited how he can travel to you.  Remember to post pictures.  Rocky is very photogenic and likes to see pictures of himself with all of his new friends.

By this time, most of our clubs and councils have held elections.  Congratulations to the new officers.  Thank you to everyone who volunteered to run for an office. Clubs if you have already mailed your OFSRDC ballots to the OFSRDC secretary Tim Hagey, thank you.  If you haven’t mailed your ballots please be sure to mail it as soon as possible so they can be counted during our state meeting on April 29.   

Until next month,  
Kathy Roberts  
OFSRDC President
