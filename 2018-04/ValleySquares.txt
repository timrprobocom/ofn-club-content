Our 69th Anniversary Party kicks off the month of April.  Please help us celebrate at Aloha Grange April 7th.  Scott Zinser is calling and Connie Clark cueing.  
 Dig out your outfits from the 50’s and 60’s and join us for our Sock Hop April 21st.  Renee Ruud is calling & Connie Clark cueing.  When I think of those days I picture guys lined up in front of the bleachers while we girls waited for them to gather courage to ask us to dance. One of my students wrote about her fifth grade square dance class where the boys stood, hands behind their backs, “as if they had suction cups attaching them to the wall.” So apt!
 Our Souper Bowl Dance had yummy soups, mostly of the vegetarian variety.  We had a fun contingent from Tri-Squares as well as other guests.  Colorful beads added to the atmosphere for our Mardi Gras Dance. 
 Our lessons have been great fun.  Craig Abercrombie gets the students dancing right away.  We have between 12 - 17 students, depending on how many make the trek from Tillamook. 
 We ended the month with a visitation to Hoedowners 68th Birthday Dance.
