Last month's article left us with the cliffhanger of how Randy's DBD plus lessons would go.  This month we are happy to share that they are going extremely well, with three to four squares showing up every week.  Many stay for the dance.  Some are long time friends, while others are newer friends.  We welcome them all.
 At our most recent M 'n M dance a good turnout of Valley River Dancers allowed them to take our banner again.  We had a great time visiting them to retrieve our banner and anticipate visiting them again soon.   
 Toe Draggers' hospitality provided us with another delightful evening as we retrieved our banner from them.  We were greeted by friends we hadn't seen for a while and made new friends.  
 Luckily, February's snow didn't disrupt our dance schedule, and spring is underway.
