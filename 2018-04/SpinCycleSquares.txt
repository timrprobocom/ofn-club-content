Please call our president, David Lajoie at 541-520-7311 or Tim at 541-988-0399 to make sure we are dancing as we go dark once in a blue moon.  We don't want to miss you.

We are so blessed to have national caller, Kris Jensen, call for us a number of times during the year.  Kris and Kurt's mom now lives in Eugene (formerly Medford).  Lucky us dancers! And thank you Kris!  Our caller, Tim Matteson, gets a chance to dance. 

Happy dancing!
