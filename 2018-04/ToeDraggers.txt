So, enjoying the Spring flowers popping up all over.  We are looking forward to a busy time ahead of us.  Hope you join us for our March 16th Shamrock Sashay at the Kinton Grange, but do remember our first dance in April on the 6th will be held at the ODD Fellows Hall in Hillsboro.  We will be back to the Kinton Grange on April 20th for Cherry Blossom Festival.
 We have been out visiting other clubs these last few months and having a great time.  We are looking forward to our Mystery Trip in May, Progressive Dinner and Kinton Grange Rummage Sale in June, Summer Festival, and our club campout in Aug.  There is lots of planning ahead to keep us busy and fun activities to look forward to with the Toe Draggers Club. We do have a good time together.  Hope to see you in a square.
