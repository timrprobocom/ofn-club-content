The club completed Waltz and started Jive lessons on March 15. The waltz class was mainly refreshing waltz steps the last two weeks before we switched over to the Jive lessons. We are dancing to make sure we know what we learned and maybe work on a step that shows some difficulty. 
Cheryl has given us some dates when she will be gone and our Vice President is working on getting another cuer to take over those nights. We will be checking with Jeanine Norden and Ken Pratt to serve as our guest cuers and we look forward to having them come and grace our stage. Always fun to have them around.
We are working on getting officers elected and dues collected on the business end of our club. Our door price goes up March 15 to $7.00 per person. We are hoping that does not keep you from visiting our club on Thursday evenings. Marilyn Schmit
