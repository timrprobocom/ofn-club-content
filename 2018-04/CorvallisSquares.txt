We have two new club members, who joined after finishing mainstream lessons, and we're enjoying their enthusiasm for the fun activity and camaraderie that square dancing brings. New members add to the energy of the club! 

By the time this OFN comes out, we will have had our annual Coast Retreat the weekend of March 9-11. Highlights include the dancing, of course, and the social time including the group potluck on Saturday at noon. It's not too early to save the 2nd weekend in March for next year's Coast Retreat!
