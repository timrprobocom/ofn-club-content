Tri Squares had a terrific Mardi Gras Masquerade Ball in February.  We gave away over $1,000 in raffles and door prizes!
 In March we finished up our Mainstream lessons.  And in April we're looking forward to our annual general meeting dinner with elections for next year's officers.
 Come join us for a dance - Saturday, April 14th is "Pay It Forward" when we bring donations for the Good Neighbor Center in Tigard, and Friday, April 27th is "Hippie Hoedown" when costumes are really fun.
