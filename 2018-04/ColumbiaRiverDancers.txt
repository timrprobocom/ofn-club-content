You have heard the old adage that time flies when you're having fun?  Well, who would have believed that we passed the three-year mark last month, having fun the entire time?  While square dancing seems to be on a slight decline around the nation, we continue to believe it is worth striving to be a club that provides a fun and friendly place to dance and make good friends.  We continue to have a beginning class starting the first Tuesday of each month.  Jim Hattrick, who will be calling on the 14th, is our teacher extraordinaire.  
 Our annual meeting is set for the 24th of March, prior to our second dance of the month.  We will be providing pizza and soft drinks to members.  So, here is a good deal; join our club, get a really cool looking badge, and have a slice or two of pizza while enjoying the friendliest people around.  
 For members, this is a reminder that dues need to be paid soon as the insurance has to go to the state office ASAP.  Our dues help defray the cost of decorations and supplies for our dance and lessons.  The cost is $15 if you need insurance or $9 if you paid insurance at another club.  Square dance insurance is required for all club members.  You only have to pay for insurance once no matter how many clubs you join.  
 Our Second dance in April will be to with Darrell Kalmbach calling and Ken Pratt cueing.  Darrell always has a call or two that keeps all dancers on their toes and keeps the party fun.  We always look forward to his coming to us.  
 Just a reminder that we dance plus from 7 to 8 and mainstream from 8 to 10 or so.  Our club is known for making sure everyone gets to dance, so singles are welcome.  See you in a square.
 Did you know that it takes 32 beats to do a Grand Square, not 28 as some people may think.
