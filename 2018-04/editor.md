Spring is in the air, and it feels like the days are getting a bit warmer.  Lots of special dances are going on this month.  Your hard-working Federation board will be meeting in Port Orford at the end of the month to conduct Federation business and count the ballots for our 2018-19 slate of officers.

See you in a square!
