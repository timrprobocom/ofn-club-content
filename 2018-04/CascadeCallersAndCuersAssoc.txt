Our next scheduled dances are June 30, September 29 and December 29.  We'll have to decide whether or not we';ll actually have a dance December 29 since New Year's Eve is just a couple of days later. 

Our current board is President - Linda Putzler, Vice-President - Sandy Harris, Secretary - Christina Corelli, Treasurer - Gail Jackson   All all woman board.  The next time you read our OFN blurb we should have a new board to present to you.  Hopefully, at our March 31 meeting we'll have other members willing to take on an office.

We do have fairly new callers and cuers who have joined CCCA and call and or cue at our Fifth Saturday dances.  We have a CCCA meeting prior to the dance. 

Keep on dancing, calling and cueing for FUN
Christina Corelli
Secretary  - CCCA
