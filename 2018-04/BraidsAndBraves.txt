 We had a fun Valentineâ€™s Day dance with guest caller Bruce Lowther. Our new dancers came and we had guests as well. Several accepted the challenge to bring their wedding photos and it was really interesting!  What a great idea! 

Members are also enjoying attending Anniversary dances at other Mid-Willamette Area clubs. We support each other and have more fun. Carmen
