In February a series of new round dance lessons began, consisting of the waltz and hosted by Willamette Squares at the Salem Square Dance Center. There will be no further square dance lessons until next fall.

Willamette Squares always enjoy their regular dances on the fourth Saturday at the Salem Square Dance Center. You can count on a variety of food choices and lively camaraderie. You might want to consider wearing a bit of green for our March dance.
