They say February is the border between winter and spring but this year it’s when winter arrived.  Hoedowners can’t complain because it seems that February flew by and we were oh so busy!  We began the month on the first with a casual evening out at Pizzario in Hillsboro to enjoy wood fired pizza and listen to new members Earl and Mosu perform.  What a wonderful, spontaneous evening. 
 February 10th was our Queen of Hearts Dance and on the following Saturday, February 17th, twenty Hoedowners attended a visitation at Sunset Promenaders.  We had a spectacular time and enjoyed our first opportunity to wear our new club outfits on a visitation.  Those hats are starting to show up everywhere.
 We celebrated the Hoedowner 68th Anniversary Dance on the 24th with our traditional chicken dinner.  We added mac and cheese to the menu and it was gone by evening’s end.  We love seeing the Aloha Grange dining room filled to over flowing.  We counted 105 for dinner and a total attendance of 116. Big thanks to the four clubs who held visitations; Valley Squares, Sunset Promenaders, Eager Beavers and Toe Draggers and to all the guest callers and cuers; Darrell Kalmbach, Mike and Julie Stout, Mark Wheeler, Janienne Alexander and Connie Clark.
 Back by popular demand we scheduled a Hoedowner Paint Nite on February 26th.  We met early for dinner then laughed our way through two hours of learning to paint “Fairy Lites”.  I hope you have a chance to see the display.
 In April we’ll break out the boots and spurs for our Wild, Wild West Dance on the 14th.  Everyone will be gussied up in their best and rarin’ to whoop it up.  How about you?
 April 28th will be more sedate for our Hope to “Sea” you Dance.  Whether you like your salt water crashing on the rocks or lapping at the shore, Hoedowners will be ready to greet you at the door.
