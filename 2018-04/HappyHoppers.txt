Question:  What happens when our Happy Hopper caller is out of town?  Answer:  We get to enjoy the calling and cueing of a guest caller and cuer.  Jim Hattrick will not be with us at our April 7th dance.  Instead, we are pleased to have Darrell Kalmbach calling and Susan Healea cueing.  Both Darrell and Susan do a terrific job, and we are excited to have the opportunity to dance to them at our wonderful hall.  It will certainly be a great evening of dancing.

	Question:  Does everyone like ice cream?  Answer:  Definitely yes!  What a great opportunity is coming!  Our April 21st dance will be our annual ice cream social.  In addition to the outstanding calling and cueing of Jim Hattrick, we will have ice cream and lots of toppings so guests and members can build their own gigantic sundae.  It’s always amazing to see the combinations our ice cream connoisseurs can devise.  Of course, then there are the less complex servings made with good old vanilla ice cream and hot fudge—yum! 
 
April is also the month when we finish our lesson schedule.   While we have not had the usual high number of students this year, we have enjoyed getting to know and angel a number of beginner and plus pupils.  The hope is, of course, that they will continue their interest in square dancing and encourage their friends to join our classes when we resume them again in the fall.

	 We are really looking forward to May when we “Swing into Spring” and celebrate our 59th anniversary at our May 5th dance.  Although we are a plus club, our anniversary dance follows a two mainstream and one plus tip format so that our students who are finishing mainstream class can enjoy time with club members.  Therefore, anyone who is a dancer can attend and enjoy the great food, decorations, and Jim Hattrick’s calling and cueing.  So, mark your calendars and come “Swing into Spring” as we celebrate this milestone in our club’s history.
