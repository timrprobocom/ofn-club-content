Thank you to everyone who came to our youth fundraiser dance. There were over three squares at the dance and we had a great time dancing to Leonard and Judy. We raised over $1,000 for the competition. Our cash raffle winners were Izzy Bickle, Georganne Pfinster and the boss of one of our club members.

Mom (Karyn Buchheit) is definitely looking for volunteers to help out at competition - there are a lot of jobs that need to be covered and there are not very many of the previous volunteers coming down from Canada and Washington just to volunteer. She also asked me to let people know that if you are volunteering on Saturday morning, you are provided lunch and if you are volunteering on Saturday afternoon, you are provided dinner. Please call mom at 503-873-5241 or to sign up to volunteer by emailing her at   buchheitfarmkm@gmail.com.  Please don't assume that mom remembers that you talked to her previously and said that you would do something or that one of us kids gave her your information. She is neck deep in festival registrations and paperwork.

We have had an added difficulty with our competition practices this year. Not only do several members of our teams have jobs and college/high school, we also have a few who can only make one of the two practices a week AND we have had chicken pox going through our teams. Three of our team members have had it and we are hoping that we are through (nobody else has come down with it for a little over a week - one more week to go to know for sure). See you at a dance soon!!!!
