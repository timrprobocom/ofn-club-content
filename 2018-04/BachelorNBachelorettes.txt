We’ve picked up some new members this past year, in spite of the fact that I tell people I wouldn’t join a club that would have someone like me as a member!

Come for a great night out on Apr 11 as we host our 53 Anniversary dance.  We’ll have Dan Nordbye from Arizona and Tami Helms cueing, as we do every anniversary.  Hope to see you there.  Decoration Chairman, Dorcus Decor, promises to make this one beautiful dance.  Kitchen committee Cal Amari and Brent Burntwell will be making us some unforgettable treats.
