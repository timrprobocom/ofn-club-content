The Sunset Promenaders Club is busy with lesson schedule each Sunday Mainstream Square Dance from 4 to 6 with Mike Stout and Julie instructing.  The lessons are coming along well and these students and number are encouraging for the Club to build up our club member numbers with good and a little younger dancers.  We had a B-51 Jamboree on the 18th of March and it was fun.
 Our April dance calendar is:
 • April 7th our Club is DARK so we can go visit the Valley Squares in Aloha on their Anniversary. 
 • Thursday April 5th and 19th is our Plus Dances, with Darrell and Ken.
 • Our Saturday April 21st dance theme is traveling bear dance.  This is a Mainstream dance and comes with an invitation to all dancers to come meet “Teddy”, have your picture take with him, and some lucky club will be able to take him home so they can have a bear dance soon too.  Teddy is friendly and he likes to travel.
 • Our schedule for each dance is Round dance at 7:00, Square Dance starts at 7:30 until 9:30.  Additional parking is available at the bank across the street.  The Location is IOOF Hall (upstairs) at 267 E. Main St. in Hillsboro.  503-805-5867 for information..
