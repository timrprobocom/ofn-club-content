Our March election results are in. Several officers are returning this year: Secretary Linda and Charlie Phillips, Treasurer Debbi and Dan Ragland, Publicity Ron Rasmussen, 2nd Vice President Robert and Young Lumsden, and President Marc and Bev De La Bruere.  We elected a new 1st Vice President to begin in May, Patti Smith. Welcome aboard, Patti!  A big thanks goes to our outgoing 1st Vice President Tom and Katie Cassatt who have served faithfully for five years.

The Boring Barn is a busy place but our Barn Sale is one of the busiest times of the year! Come on out for our Annual Barn Sale fundraiser on April 13th and 14th this year. You can shop from 9:00 AM until 4:00 PM on Friday and Saturday. You are sure to find something you can use!  We really appreciate how the square dance community supports this club at our fundraisers.

Plus lessons will be going on with Scott Zinser teaching from March 15th through May 31st, on Thursday evenings from 7:30 to 9:30 PM. Come be an angel for our class, if your plus skills are sufficient,  or a student if you need to brush up your skills. On Monday evenings, starting in April, Dan Nordbye will be doing some Mainstream Funshops. Come out and check it out! Dan is a first class caller.

Be sure to sign up for our May Mystery bus trip scheduled for May 12, 2018. Iâ€™d let you know where we are going, but nobody has let the cat out of the bag, yet. It is sure to be fun and full of surprises! $35 will get you a seat on the bus, snacks, supper, and presumably a dance somewhere.

The Country Cut-Ups are a fun club to dance with so come out and join us for dances on the 1st, 4th, and 5th Saturdays. Mary Jane and her gang have been doing a bang up job on the decorations and our food is always great. The traffic is not too bad, so grab you dancing shoes and a partner and head our way!
