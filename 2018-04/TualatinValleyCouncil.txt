The TVC is about to become the largest Council of square dance clubs in the State of Oregon.  The Tualatin Valley Council has accepted a petition from the Valley River Dancers to become members of the Council.  Upon receipt of their Constitution and By-Laws and other requirements that may need to be met, the Valley River Dancers will become the thirteenth member of the TVC.  The May issue of the OFN will have the first club report from the VRD.  Welcome to the TVC.
 Since the OFN is published mid month, you still have time to plan on the TVC Spring Fling Dance, on the 5th Saturday, March 31st.  It will be held at the Kinton Grange, 19015 SW Scholls Ferry Rd, Beaverton, OR 97007.  This dance will feature Janienne Alexander calling with Mark McDonald cueing.  The dance begins with pre-rounds at 7:30 followed by Mainstream with rounds at 8:00.  Every third tip will be Plus. This dance is hosted by the Tualatin Timber Squares.
