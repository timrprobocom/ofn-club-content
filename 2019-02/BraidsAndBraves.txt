We had a great Christmas Dance with lots of great decorations in the room and lots of photos were taken and shared. Sandra was an adorable Christmas elf, cueing rounds with the help of Judy Russell. Leonard called a fun dance and Bruce Lowther called as well. We had a great time of fellowship and good food afterwards. Square dancers are the most fun people! We are looking forward to meeting those fun people at the Mid-Winter Festival. Carmen
