Our canned food dance wound up 2018.  After the dance Dan Knierim took all the food from the stage to the Oregon Food Bank barrels downstairs, a heavy load.
 As always, we gathered in a circle to sing Silent Night to close the dance.  We left with warm feelings, the perfect way to say farewell to 2018.  
 We hope that you will join us for every dance in 2019.
