The kiddies have some toys thanks to the Toy Dance donations.  Even with the holiday events 4 squares were on the floor.  This was our only dance in December, however our club did celebrate together with a meal and gift exchange.  Some of our members are talented and provided gifts that were "stolen" and passed around to the great enjoyment of us all. 
 On a sad note 2 of our precious members recently passed away: Joy Westervelt and Glenn Faires, they will be missed.
 February 8th will be our Valentine's dance, we will be a little ahead of the day for sweethearts but we will be lovin' the dancing (smiley/wink).  Fourth Saturday dance is in honor of President's Day.
 Please remember that our dances are now ending at 9:30pm.  7-8 Plus and advanced rounds, 8-9:30pm Mainstream with rounds.  106 NW 8th, Kelso/Longview intersection on Ocean Beach Hwy, in the hall at the water park.
 Our website www.r-square-d.info is a great way to keep track of our club and events, or friend us on Facebook.  Our caller is Craig Abercrombie and our cuer is Lonnie Sycks.
