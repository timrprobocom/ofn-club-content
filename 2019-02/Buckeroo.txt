We have been dancing the month away! All of our students are getting as much floor time as possible to be ready for Mid-Winter! We had a great time at our annual holiday craft fair and are working at getting things together for our spring craft event. If you are interested in joining us, and purchasing a table to sell your crafts, please go to our website and contact us…space is still available.

Our New Dancer Dance is this month. It is the perfect time to brush up on all the calls before you head to Albany for the Mid-Winter Party. This dance will be held on January 13th, at 2:00 pm. The Umpqua Area Council is putting on this dance. If you are in the area, please join us at the barn for an afternoon of fun!

We welcomed in the New Year with a great dance. Everyone, including our new dancers, enjoyed a festive celebration.  Spending time with people you enjoy and dancing in the New Year is one of the best ways to spend New Year’s Eve!

Happy dancing,
Robin Faltersack
