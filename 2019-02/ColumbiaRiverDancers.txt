New year, new caller, but the same place and times.  We are excited to have Renee Ruud as our newest caller to call for the Columbia River Dancers.  She will be calling our February 9th dance at our usual stomping grounds, the Hazel Dell Grange.  Julie Stiers will do the cueing.  Since this is our Valentine's Dance let's go for red and white all around.
 Our second dance is on the 23rd with Jim Hattrick doing the calling and cueing.  This has no theme as we will have come through the Burn-off, Christmas Dance, New Year's eve and the winter festival.  But what great dances they were.
 We had such a great time at the New Year's Eve dance that the CRDs are planning to host another one this year.  We believe that we will have the Front Porch Trio (Adam could not make it this year).  Stay tuned for further developments.
 Remember that we dance plus from 7 to 8 and mainstream from 8 to quitting time.  Our goal is to make sure everyone gets to dance so singles are always welcome.
