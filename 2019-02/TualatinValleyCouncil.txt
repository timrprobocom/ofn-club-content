The annual TVC New Years Eve Dance had 84 attendees with 8 enthusiastic squares dancing at one point. Darrell Kalmbach called a spirited fun dance with Randy Lewis cueing our favorites.  Dancers enjoyed crockpot foods and desert bar between tips. We began dancing at 9PM, ushered in the New Year, and wrapped up at 12:15. The club with the highest percentage of their members present was the Sunset Promenaders and were rewarded with the TVC Banner.
 Since the OFN is published mid month, you still have time to consider attending the annual TVC Presidents Meeting & Potluck honoring current and past club Presidents.  It will be held at the IOOF Hall, 267 East Main Street, Hillsboro, OR 97123 on January 28th with the potluck dinner starting at 6:00 and meeting at 7:00.  All TVC club Presidents & dancers are invited to join us. The TVC wishes to thank all the presidents of the TVC Clubs for volunteering their time and efforts into this activity we all love.  Also, at this meeting the TVC President, Mike St Clair, will announce the recipient of the Tualatin Valley Council “Recognition Award” for outstanding service and special contribution to the square dance community within the TVC geographical area.
 Our next Council event is the Spring Fling Dance, held at the Hillsboro IOOF Hall on March 30th. This dance will feature Randy Dibble calling with Jeanine Norden cueing.  The dance begins with pre-rounds at 7:30 followed by Mainstream with rounds at 8:00. Every third tip will be Plus.  This dance is co-hosted by the Mix N' Mingle.
