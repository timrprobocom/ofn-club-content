Our Fall Mainstream Class has graduated and is ready to attend their first Mid-Winter Festival.  What a treat to have them a part of the Square Dance Family, dancing with enthusiasm, skill, confidence, and flair!  We are very proud of them. Kudos to George Hermann, club caller and mainstream class instructor! And a special thanks to Dave Oâ€™Neil, IWW Membership Chair, for a superb job of organizing and coordinating the fall lessons. We really appreciate Salem Hospital allowing us to hold our classes at the hospital.

Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays of each month at Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall.  Especially be sure to come to our special March 9 IWW Birthday Dance and April 13 Easter Dance. Dee and Bert Mackaman
 
Best wishes to all for 2019 as we begin another year of dancing. Our Lebanon first dance of the year was on January 5, a Mardi Gras dance with lots of costumes, beads, and fun. There were four squares on the floor. Dee
