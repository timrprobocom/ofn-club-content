The Hayshakers have done a lot of visitations recently and more are planned.  On Saturday December 8th we danced with the Columbia River Dancers in the Hazel Dell Grange in Vancouver.  The next Saturday we danced Plus with the Happy Hoppers in Vancouver’s Washington Grange.  We drove in circles finding the Grange as it was our first time there, but we did get there on time.
 The Hayshakers went dark on December 21st since it was so close to Christmas.  On New Year’s Eve we joined the Columbia River Dancers again for their Starry Night Dance complete with amazing desserts and fireworks!
 As of this writing, more visitations are planned: the Happy Hoppers Plus dancing on the 5th of January [much easier to find the Washington Grange this time] and R-Squre-D’s Snowflake Frolic Dance in Kelso on Friday January 11th. A Hayshaker dance is planned for Friday, January 18th at 6:00 p.m. in the Pacific Grange on Hwy. 101 between Seaside and Astoria. 
 Our February dance will be held on the 15th.
