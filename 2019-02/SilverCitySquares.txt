Our new dancer dance went very well. We had over 60 people show up overall and a majority of them came to the dinner as well.

At our January dance, we implemented a price change in our door fees. The adult price is now $5.00; the youth price remains the same at $3.00 and the family rate is now $15.00.

Mom (Karyn Buchheit) is looking for volunteers for the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival. There are a lot of jobs for her to fill and she does prefer using more volunteers with shorter shifts to allow the volunteers time to watch the competitions. Please contact her if you are interested. See you at a dance soon. Petrina Buchheit
