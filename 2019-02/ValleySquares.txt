Our February dances will be lots of fun, come join us. Valley Squares February 2nd dance theme is “Groundhog Day” (did you see him?) with Daryl Clendenin and Renee Ruud calling, Connie Clark cueing.  Let's celebrate, we're still dancing.
 Our February 16th dance theme is “Sweetheart Dance” with Craig Abercrombie calling, Connie Clark cueing. Lets rev up the dance in red and chocolate!  These will be very fun dances, hope you can join us!
 Our classes started Jan 15th, but at this writing date I can't give any update, our reports are due a month prior.  Come Angel if you can, the more dancers the better for the students.
And save the date,  April 6th for Valley Squares 70th Anniversary Dance with “The Crew” calling and Connie Clark cueing.  70 years!  Celebrate Big!
 See you in a square, Yellowrock,
