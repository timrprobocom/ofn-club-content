We are saddened by the sudden and unexpected passing of our own Neal Keefer. Neal died on December 5 of a sudden heart attack while riding his bicycle, which was something he loved.  Neal and his wife Virginia were our club president couple in 2017 until the spring of 2018 when their term expired. Neal was also president of the Milwaukie Community Center and played a big part in getting our new ceiling tiles in the dance hall. He is sorely missed and our hearts go out to his wife Virginia and family. A celebration of life memorial service was held at our hall (Milwaukie Community Center) December 29. River City Dancers provided the reception set up and food. 

We began the new year with a New Years Eve dance in our hall. Dan Nordbye called and Julie Stiers cued. We held a New Dancers dance January 13 with a “experienced  clothing” sale . Our club visitation that month is to Mid-Winter Festival.

Future dates to remember are Saturday February 11 which is our Valentines Dance. And March 9 which is our 50’s dance. 

We look forward to seeing and dancing with you all in 2019. Come see us.

Happy dancing in 2019
