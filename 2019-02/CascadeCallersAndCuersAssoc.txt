Our next scheduled Fifth Saturday Dance isn't until March 30.  This may be our annual area benefit dance.  I'll keep you posted.

The New Year's Eve dance was a successful entering into 2019 affair.  One dancer shy of nine squares.  It was good to see Jim Voll who had a wonderful time visiting and dancing.  Sandy Harris did two guest tips calling and cueing.  She was dressed in black with glittering bling.  Fun!  We had dancers from up north and down south and everywhere in between. There were pies and lots of other goodies as well. Happy New Year 2019 to all!

Keep on dancing, calling and cueing for FUN
