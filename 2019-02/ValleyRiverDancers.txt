There were 3+ squares at our new dancer / Christmas Dance, and the new dancers attending seemed to have a good time, along with everyone else.  We had a gift exchange game at break that had a few of us chuckling.  This was Julie Stiers last dance to cue on contract for the Valley River Dancers after being with us for more than 4 years.  We want to send Julie off with the warmest of good wishes for a great new year of cueing opportunities.  The dance ended with our traditional sing a-long of Silent Night.
 We are dark for our usual 4th Friday Mainstream dance in January for Mid-Winter Festival. 
 In February, we dance Plus on the 2nd Friday (February 8th) with Ken and Dianne Pratt cueing intermediate rounds and caller at this writing still to be determined.  Prior to starting Plus at 8 pm (and going to 10:30 pm), we are continuing our round dance workshop beginning at 6:30 pm, followed by pre-rounds that start at 7:30 pm.  We have members away on the Dibble Cruise so check just to be safe the when and where and social media for any update on this dance.  General admission to the dance alone is $6 donation, and the workshop and pre-rounds alone is $6. The charge for attending both the workshop and dance is $10.  The workshop focus is on Cha Cha and will move to Rumba at a future workshop.
 Our 4th Friday (February 22nd) Mainstream Dance is our Birthday Dance.  This dance is called by Randy Dibble and will be cued by Sherri Clark.  This will be Sherriâ€™s first dance as our new 4th Friday cuer.  This dance has pre-Plus beginning at 7:30 pm with Mainstream and rounds until 10:30 pm.  Come out for some fun dancing and a little birthday cake and help us celebrate our 14th.
 Mainstream lessons begin again with Randy Dibble teaching Tuesdays at 6:30 pm at the Chehalem Community Center (south entrance) beginning February 19th.  Singles and youth welcome.  The first 2 lessons are free and thereafter $6.  There is a discount for families/youth.
