Our December dances were enjoyable with Christmas as the theme and then the special TVC dance on New Year’s Eve that capped off the year of 2018 properly.  Wow, on to 2019 already!  It seems that last year passed by way too fast but then we do have a lot to be thankful about and it was fun.
 Our February dances schedule is:
 • Saturday, February 2nd “Mardi Gras” theme for our Mainstream Dance with Mike Stout and Ken Pratt calling and cueing.
 • Thursday, February 7th Plus Dance with Darrell Kalmbach and Ken Pratt calling and cueing.
 • Saturday, February 16th, Valentine theme with Mike and Ken.
 • Thursday, February 21st, Plus Dance.
 Our Club wants to thank all the dancers that visit us, we appreciate you coming to our dances and hope you all have enjoyed yourselves.  
 For those of you that have not been to one of our dances; we are located in downtown Hillsboro at the Odd Fellows Hall, 267 E. Main Street.  There is plenty of parking either on the street or in the bank parking lot across the street.  Our hall is air-conditioned, nice dance hall with wood floor, and nice dining area next to the dance hall.  Our dances start at 7:00 with intermediate rounds, then at 7:30 to 9:30 the square dance.  Come and dance with us so we can become better friends.  If you need more information call 503-848-3841.
