We started out the holiday season with a visitation to Independence Wagon Wheelers.  We did not have enough to retrieve a banner, but we had a very good time dancing to the calling of George Hermann as well as that of his grandson Mike Kious.  The next holiday event was at the Emerald Square Dance Center with the Buccaneers’ Christmas Dance, Dec. 7.  We enjoyed dancing to Roger Putzler’s calling and Christina Corelli’s cueing.  Some of us got to taste Christina’s famous rum balls.  We always have fun starting the month with that plus dance.  Single Trees also celebrated the holiday season with our annual Christmas Dinner & Dance on Friday, Dec. 14.  Our president Larry Reetz cooked the ham for the potluck dinner which was attended by at least 29 dancers.   We all had a good dinner and then danced to Jim Hattrick’s calling and Jackie Gale’s cueing.

At the end of the month many Single Trees attended New Year’s Eve dance at the Emerald Square Dance Center where Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli offered the dance at only $2.50 per person (harkening back to the 80’s).  It was lovely to see a group from Corvallis Squares as well as some from Sweet Home Squarenaders and Roseburg’s Timber 8’s.  There were as many as nine squares of dancers in attendance with seven squares on the floor at times.  What a fun night of dancing with poppers and sparkling cider to celebrate the advent of 2019.

We’re all looking forward to Mid-Winter Festival which will be over by the time you are reading this.
