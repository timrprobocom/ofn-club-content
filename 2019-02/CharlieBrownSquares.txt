New classes started Jan 8th and we've enjoyed some enthusiastic and fun students.  We have one more class open to new students. Our September class is scheduled to graduate Mid February and we have 8 students who are very excited about dancing. We look forward to graduating and welcoming some fun dancers. 

Our January dances were a lot of fun, including Amateur nite with 3 newbie callers who tried their hand at calling.  Good job! Our dance on the 19th has guest caller Ian Craig and we will report on that dance next month. 

February brings some great dances and lots of fun.  February 2nd is our Super Bowl Dance with our annual Chili CookOff.  Chuck Simpkins and Rikki Lobato will be calling and cueing.  February 16th we have guest caller Roger Putzler calling our Sweetheart Dance and Rikki Lobato will be cueing.  Roger is lots of fun. Both dances start at 7 with pre rounds and are Mainstream dances with Plus tips. 

Boatnik is fast approaching and we are so excited to welcome Joe Saltel and TJ Chadd as our wonderful talent!!! It's going to be an awesome party. 
Many Charlie's are excited to head to Albany for Midwinter!! Always a great time with many memories made!!!

Safe travels and see you in a square!
