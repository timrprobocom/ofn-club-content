In December we had our annual holiday dinner at the Sherwood Spaghetti Factory including the customary and entertaining white-elephant gift exchange.  
 On January 6th our lessons continued on Sunday afternoons, with Sherri Clark cueing Waltz at 2:00 and Terry Halley calling  B52-B68 at 3:30.  Angels are most welcome to attend.
 In February: On Saturday the 9th we’ll dance to the theme of “Hearts and Flowers,” and on Friday the 22nd we’ll have our annual anchor dance, “The Mardi Gras Masquerade Ball”.  Terry Halley and K.C.Curtis will do the calling with Sandra Pinion cueing.  As always, there will be prizes for the best masks.  All our dances begin with Rounds at 7:30 followed by Plus at 7:45, Mainstream at 8:00 (fourth tip Plus) and refreshments at 10 pm.  Grab your costume and come join us!
