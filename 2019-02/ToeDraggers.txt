This report is most likely finding you, like me, getting ready for the biggest dance party in Oregon, Mid-Winter festival of course!  For the new students in the group, I hope you are planning on attending.  It is the most fun you can have in one place.
 The Toes are giving you 2 chances to take your special sweetheart dancing.  We are sure “Everythings coming up Roses” for our 1st dance of the month on February 1st, 7:30 pre-rounds.  Then on February 15th, is our regular dance, 7:30 pre-plus.
 Our beautiful quilt that we’ve been working on to benefit cancer research, is almost complete and will be making an appearance soon.
 Don’t be a stranger, come dance with the Toe’s.
