We’re all flying high, in anticipation of Mid-Winter.  You know the event: where we can all dance ‘till our hearts delight!  Or push our way into the resale, with all our might.  And if we get tired, there are always meetings and lots of pleasings.

Our square class is ready to graduate, and we’re happy to proclaim we have the smartest graduates in the entire council.  They are approaching mainstream level.

If you join the B&B’s now, for a mere $15 per year, you will get an additional three months membership at no charge.  Such a deal.
