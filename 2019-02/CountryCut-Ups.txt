Our mainstream class will be graduating this month and that is always exciting to introduce a new crop of dancers to our beloved square dance world. Our club welcomes new dancers that are learning and eager to get floor time. Come out and support the new dancers on the 1st and 4th Saturdays at the Boring Barn.

Because our club is doing well enough financially, we are going to include our 5th Saturday Plus dances as part of our yearly dues for the first half of 2019. If all goes well, this will be extended. At only $60 per year, per person, membership in the Country Cut-Ups is a really good deal. You only have to attend 10 of our 27 dances scheduled this year to break even! 

If you start your spring cleaning, think about donating things you no longer use to our annual Barn Sale coming up in April. We are accepting donations now. We appreciate your donations, and especially your purchases!

Come dance the most fun club in the area! (I might be a little prejudiced!)
