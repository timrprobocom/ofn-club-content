By the time this comes out, Mid-Winter Festival will be behind us, and we hope all had an enjoyable time there! February is very special for our club as it is the month of our Birthday Dance, on February 23! We'll be dark on February 9 for the Sweet Home Birthday Dance.

Thanks to all who have hosted the New Dancers’ dances. It’s encouraging to see new dancers joining the ranks. 

We're looking forward to our club’s coast trip March 8-9 at Gleneden Beach Community Club and all are welcome! We're dancing there both Friday and Saturday nights. Karen
