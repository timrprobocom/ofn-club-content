<p><img class="right" src="content/2019-02/t150/eldon160.png" /></p>
<p>Eldon Stuart Bartlett was born May 22, 1922 in Webster, South Dakota, the son of the late Harry Bartlett and Vera (Hyde) Bartlett. As a very young boy, he moved with his family to Oregon, settling first in Newberg with Vera&rsquo;s parents, Fred &amp; Della Hyde, and then in the Forest Grove community, where he had resided since 1926.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />He was a Veteran of World War II, having joined the United States Navy on September 18, 1942 in Forest Grove, Oregon. Eldon served for four years, until receiving his honorable discharge on February 4, 1946 at the rank of Water Tender 2nd Class. He received the American Area Campaign Medal, the Asiatic Pacific Area Campaign Medal, the Philippine Liberation Medal, the World War II Victory Medal and the Good Conduct Medal. His ship, the USS Robinson, a Fletcher Class destroyer, was in eight battles in the Pacific Theater during his service years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Eldon was united in marriage to Anne Louise Shanafelt on September 7, 1947 at the Bartlett family home in Forest Grove, with Eldon&rsquo;s grandfather, Pastor Burton H. Jones, officiating. (Their home is reputed to be built on a large log first used as foundation for the Indian School, originally in Forest Grove.) Following their marriage, they honeymooned on a motorcycle trip across Canada, much to the chagrin of the bride&rsquo;s mother. They lived in Forest Grove in the same house, lovingly raising children, facing hardships and having fun family vacations ever since. In total, they held hands for seventy-two years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />He was preceded in death by his wife, Anne, on March 29, 2016 in Forest Grove, after celebrating over sixty-eight years of marriage together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />In 1927, his father ran the Harry Bartlett Garage in downtown Forest Grove. In 1941, Harry and Eldon built the current shop on Forest Grove&rsquo;s Main Street &amp; 23rd Avenue, where Eldon worked from 1946 after he returned to land from WWII. Eldon purchased the shop, and added marine engine repair, renaming it Bartlett&rsquo;s Auto and Marine in the 1970&rsquo;s. His son Mike, purchased the business in 1989 renaming it Bartlett's Marine &amp; Mower. Eldon officially retired in 1995. He was always willing to help Mike by going to buy parts or to &ldquo;watch&rdquo; the shop well into his 90s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />He had been a member of the Forest Grove Kiwanis Club, the Forest Grove Elks Lodge B.P.O.E. #2440 and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows Lodge in Hillsboro.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Eldon began square dancing with Anne in 1952, having been members of the Lads and Plaids, 4N8er&rsquo;s and the Eager Beaver square dance clubs, and included their children in dancing. Eldon enjoyed performing in several plays at the Theatre In The Grove, his favorite playing the role of &ldquo;Billis&rdquo; in the South Pacific Musical which featured him dancing in a grass skirt, mop wig and a coconut bikini top!<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Eldon excelled at finding new adventures: racquetball, scuba diving (he logged 80 feet at 80 years old), boating (all his kids learned to water ski), photography, rock hounding, and spending time at their cabin at Rockaway Beach, Oregon. As a younger man, Eldon raced motorcycles, and took week long motorcycle excursions with buddies. He loved watching and helping his son, Mike, race Hydroplanes, and was a rescue diver for the race teams. He always found ways for his children and grandchildren to have their own adventures, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />He was preceded in death by his parents, Harry and Vera Bartlett, and a son, Roger Bartlett.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Survivors include his four children; Bruce Bartlett, of Portland, Oregon; Susie Bacon, of Portland, Oregon; Mike and Kim Bartlett, of Forest Grove, Oregon and Peggy and Jeff Hill, of Sherwood, Oregon; his sister and brother-in-law, Patricia and Don Carver, of Lake Grove, Oregon and his brother-in-law and spouse, George and June Shanafelt, of Lacey, Washington.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Also surviving are his eight grandchildren, Lily Bartlett, Dan Bacon, Carolyn Bacon, Dan Mosher, Brian Bartlett, Katie Hill, Ryan Hill and Casey Hill, as well as numerous nieces and nephews.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />The family suggests that remembrances may be contributions to the Forest Grove Senior and Community Center, 2037 Douglas Street, Forest Grove, Oregon 97116, in his memory. He and Anne had many lunches and conversations at the FGSCC.<br /><br />Celebration of Life&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://www.fuitenrosehoyt.com/obituary/Eldon-Bartlett/Forest-Grove-Oregon/1828095">Saturday, February 23, 2019<br />1:00 PM - 4:00 PM&nbsp;</a></p>
