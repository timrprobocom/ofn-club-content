Our Ugly Christmas Sweater Dance on December 12th was a blast.  We had enough dancers for about two or three squares on the floor.  Although no one wore any "ugly" Christmas sweater, the lucky one who wore a most unique sweater won a prize.  And, also, one lucky guest got a free ribbon to Mid Winter!  Several other door prizes were given away as well.  Thanks to everyone who made this dance a fun one.
 Beginner Square Dance lessons are starting on Wednesday, January 9th.  These will be held every week, on Wednesdays, at the Winona Grange in Tualatin, up to April, 7 to 9 p.m.  After every lesson, refreshments will be served.  If you know of anyone who wishes to learn how to square dance and join in on the fun, please come to these lessons.  If you bring a friend, you will get a buy one and get one free discount!  A note: If we do not get enough students, or any students at these lessons, we may turn them into club dances instead.  In that case, they will be on every second and fourth Wednesday nights of each month.  We will let everybody know if this happens.
 See you in a square.
