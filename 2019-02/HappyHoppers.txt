When you are a square dancer, the fun never stops!  Hopper members spent January warming up for Mid-Winter.  Jim certainly kept us on our toes with some challenging calls and some “just for fun” tips.  Now we are ready to put all this practice to work as we dance the days away at Mid-Winter which should be happening about the time this issue of the OFN is published.

     February will be another active month for us.  Happy Hoppers is more than just a square dance club.  Throughout the year our members contribute both time and material goods to our community.  For example, in December we collect gift items for children being served at the non-profit Children’s Center.   February is our annual food drive for the North Clark County Food Bank.  During both dances in February we collect canned goods which are delivered to the food bank at the end of the month.  Members and guests are invited to help us fill our food boxes with non-perishable food items.  We’re hoping to make this year a “banner year” and surpass the number of pounds of food we have collected in the past.
 
     Another activity that will resume in February is our-dine out night.  The cooks in the family really love this night for they do not have to plan a meal.  Instead they get to gather with friends at a restaurant for a great night out.  Each month we go to different restaurant.  We have tried American, Italian, Asian, Chinese, German, and Mexican.  Some of the restaurants have become favorites for our members. Each time a drawing is held, and some lucky member gets their dinner paid for by the club.

     As we look ahead, we will be planning our anniversary dance which will happen in the spring.  This year our club will be 60 years old.  A lot of changes have taken place during those years, but one thing that never changes is the fun and comradeship square dancers share as members of this wonderful community.
