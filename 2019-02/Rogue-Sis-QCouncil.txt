Hi Everyone,

The “Pajamarama” on Jan 11th was well attended. Everyone had a good time dancing to Phil Ramey and other local callers. Elaine Funk did her usual great job of cueing for the round dancers present. This will become an annual “New Dancer” dance. The Callers & Cuers “Winter Jambroee” will be February 10th. The council is also thinking about sponsoring a few more “New Dancer” dances for the students. They need all the help they can get, as we all did at this stage of our learning. Stay tuned for more updates about these dances.

By now, the clubs should be aware of the Federation Meeting to be held in Rogue Sis-Q Council on May 4th & 5th. The Saturday meeting will be held in the Park where Phil & Roberta Claudson live. The evening meal will be a crock pot Potluck. Your club delegates have sign up sheets for dishes and other things to bring. The last time the Federation met in our area, we had a crock pot Potluck and it was a huge success. Let’s make this a repeat performance, so people will know Southern Oregon is a fun place to go.

Be sure to support your club and the clubs in your Council. Your help and support is very important to the future of our activity.

The next Council meeting will be February 5, 2019 at Round Table Pizza in Poplar Square.

Lois & Lorri
