Happy New Year everyone from Circle n Square we hope this year will be one of the best.

We held our first new dancer class Jan.7th and had 4 new dancers. What a great way to start the new year. 

We want to say a big THANK YOU to the Oregon Federation for sending us our portion of the profits from Summer Fest. 

As we venture into the new year, once again, we say thank you to our outgoing officers, and all the best to our incoming ones.

We want to extend an invitation to everyone and hope you will attend our Valentine Dance February 16th.

Even though it is two months away, just a reminder we are hosting the council dance in March. I may be stepping out of line here, but I would like to give the dance a theme. How about we make the dance an Easter dance? and to add a twist, let's make it an "Easter Bonnet" dance. So while I may be authorized to do so, I say dust off, or create a new Easter Bonnet! Now men put on your best Top Hat, Cowboy Hat, or you guessed it create one. This is an idea I hope everyone will go along with. There will be a special prize for the best Bonnet, and Hat.

Hope to see you on the floor
