Our BIG event will be happening on January 20, 2019  --  our 70th birthday dance.  It will be a bash with lots of prizes, a raffle, and strawberry shortcake. Charlotte Jeskey will be calling, with guest caller, Jim Voll and Jackie Gale will be cueing. Please plan to help us celebrate as we are the second oldest club in Oregon. 

Our hearts were saddened recently as Joyce Voll, cuer for our club for many years, passed away. A memorial was held for her on January 13 with dancing following. 

Many of our club members will be attending Mid Winter Festival the end of January.  Our dance on February 2 will be a regular dance with Charlotte calling and Jackie Cueing. Our dance on February 16 will be a Sweetheart dance. We are always glad to have visitors. See you in a square! Marilyn York
