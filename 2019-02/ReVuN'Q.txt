We have survived the New Year and are still dancing weekly to learn our Cha moves and work on our West Coast Swing. We will be changing rhythms soon, so stay tuned. Not all settled as of yet, but we are getting closer.
Several of our dancers attended Ken Pratt’s New Year’s Eve dance. I heard there were 17 couples in attendance. That is great news and hope they had a good time.
Soon it will be time to put names to paper to see if anyone is interested in running for office and wanting to join our club. There are all sorts of possibilities available. Let us know what you think.
We will be going dark January 24 for the Trails-In Dance for Mid-Winter. Hope to see you there to dance to Scot and Erin Byars, from California. It should be a great dance to get prepared for the long weekend of dancing and socialization. Marilyn Schmit
