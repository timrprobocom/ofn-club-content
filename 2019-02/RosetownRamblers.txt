The Ramblers are pleased to announce a change in venue for our monthly dances. Effective January 12, 2019, we have started holding our monthly dances at the Oak Grove Community Club, 14496 SE Cedar Ave., Oak Grove, Oregon. This is the same hall where the Oaky Doaks dance, and where the Portland Area Council dances are held. We will continue to hold our dances on the Second Saturday of each month, alternating Mainstream and Plus levels from 7:30 to 9:30.

Here is our upcoming caller schedule:
February 9: Anne Uebelacker
March 9: Dark

May 11: Ian Craig (Mainstream Graduation Dance)
June 8: Don Wood
July and August: Dark.
 
We welcome all dancers!

SYIAS!
