On Monday, January 14th, we started a new Beginner Class. We had a great turn out, but we need more angels to help the new dancers.  Come on out from 6:30pm to 8:30pm to angel and help the students learn how great Square Dancing is. We have a great time. Phil is a lot of fun.

The last “Game Night” was January 18th. What a lot of fun we had. Some Friday night when we are having “Game Night” come out and join us. It is a “Hoot.” If you don’t play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on or if there is some other “Game” you would like to play, let us know.  We are open to most any table game. The next one should be in a couple of months; stay tuned for updates.

Wednesdays with Wayne are over until April, when he and Debbie get back from their travels. In its place, Phil will be doing a Mainstream/Plus Workshop to give everyone who feels a little shaky about some moves, a chance to come out and practice. There were 2 squares plus on the first night. Phil says he may even attempt to throw in a little bit of Advanced, not to worry, it will be easy Advanced. Come on out and enjoy a fun evening and maybe learn something.

Don’t forget the Stars’ Birthday Dance is on February 23, 2019 and the caller, Ed Kremers from Magalia, CA, will not be able to be the caller. His home was in Magalia, CA and it was lost in the Camp Fire. We were able to find another caller for the dance. Richard Lane will come down from Roseburg to do the dance for us. The cuer will be Elaine Funk. It should be a great evening. We will bring Ed back to call for us when he lets us know he is ready to do so.

Star thru, square thru
