September lessons are winding down, and Mid-Winter is just about history.  Now we need to focus on showing our new graduates and club guests what a good time we have as square dancers.

December was a particular hard month for square dancers; we have a long list of obituaries this month.  Take care of yourselves, please.  We need all the dancers we can get!
