Hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season. We are still dancing the first and third Fridays of the month and would love to have you join us. We usually have some kind of theme to add to the fun and Caller Bruce Lowther and Cuer Sandy Harris do their best to have music that follows the theme. Feb 1 our guest caller/cuers will be the Girls Night Out. (See flyer) Sandy
