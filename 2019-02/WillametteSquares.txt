The Willamette Squares Christmas dance was wintery themed and enjoyed by everyone present. The mood was festive, the refreshments were traditional and the calling and cueing merry and bright.
Our January dance on our regular dance night will be dark due to the Midwinter festival. However, our new dancer dance took place Sunday afternoon, January 6, at the Salem Square dance Center. As always it was a fun dance! John, our president, has become a snowbird and will be headed to Yuma, Arizona soon after our new dancer dance and returning mid April. In the meantime, our vice president, Kevin, will fill in.
Willamette Squares members are thinking of Lee Ashwill following his surgery and wishing him well.
Our club will be back on track in February of the New Year and we look forward to lots of dancing in 2019!  Jodee
