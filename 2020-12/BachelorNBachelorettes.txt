There’s probably no dancing well into next year, and we didn’t have the heart to enforce dues to a dance club that isn’t dancing.  So, what we did was to waive dues for our fiscal year ending March.  That means that for those who actually paid dues (about half our club), they’ll have their memberships extended until March, 2022.
