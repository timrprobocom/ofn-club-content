We are now renting the hall so we can visit and still practice social distancing where it is warm and dry--no dancing though.  The ceiling in our hall is quite high, and the hall is big enough to socially distance quite easily.  
We learned that one of our local square and round dancers, Sue Nelson, recently passed away from cancer.  She was a cancer survivor too and had participated in the Relay for Life a number of times.  We are so sorry.  We keep her husband, Terry, in our thoughts.  They came to dance with us, supported us, and were much appreciated.  Sue and Terry supported all of the clubs in our area and enjoyed going to festivals too.  They especially enjoyed going to the coast for festivals and to Diamond Lake.  Sue's parents, Jim and Fern Rundall danced for many years up to the C-2 level.  Sue leaves behind two daughters, their husbands and a granddaughter, Pearl.  Their dog, Kona, was trained by Sue. They were able to compete in dog trials.  Our condolences go out to the family.

Tim Matteson's mom is hanging in there and has a caregiver during the week when Tim is working at the chocolate factory.  She is slowly regaining strength. 

Stay safe and healthy,
