We are sad to inform our fellow dancers that long time member Dave Franklin passed away Nov 5, 2020. Dave and Su have been members of our club since our inception, and were charter members. Both Dave and Su served as officers and board members; helping create and organize the Gold Diggers Dance and worked at our "Pepsi Booth" at the Siskiyou Co. fair. Dave designed and built the first "Pepsi Booth" which is still in use at the fairgrounds during their daily operations. As with many members they both donated countless hours as members and "angels" Dave loved wood working. Both Dave and Su were avid bicyclist, sometimes biking 20 to 30 or more miles per day. They traveled through out the United States attending many festivals dancing and biking at everyone.  Among their favorites were Diamond Lake, Boatnick. and most recently the Royal Romp. Sherrie and I have personally known them over 50 years, and will sadly miss seeing and dancing with them. I think the last time we saw them was at our birthday dance called by Eric Henerlau. Due to Covid restrictions no services are planned. If you would like to send a card or contact Su, she has asked that you please contact Sherrie or I for that info.
  At this time we still have no plans to start dancing or holding classes until January, or possibly later if the current restrictions stay in place and numbers keep rising. We certainly miss dancing and visiting with fellow friends and dancers, but do not want to take any risks. 
We want to wish everyone a safe, healthy, and happy holiday seasons.
