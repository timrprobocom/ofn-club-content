First of all, hoping that those who are reading this are anticipating some kind of holiday with family in a safe manner. Our club continues to dance on Thursday’s and learning Bolero rhythm and getting some floor time with other rhythms.

We have lost a few dancers because of the mask requirement and they won’t return until the requirement is eased by the dance center board. Hopefully that is soon. They had a board meeting in November and don’t know the result yet.

We had a special Saturday afternoon dance on November 7, with a small attendance but had fun anyway. We are scheduled for a New Year’s Eve dance, but no plans are in cement yet. That will be worked on in the next couple weeks. 

2020 has been an exasperating year for many. We are grateful to be dancing and so far no one has gotten sick. We take care of the hall and get it disinfected each time we are there. Let’s hope we continue to stay well in 2021. Marilyn Schmit
