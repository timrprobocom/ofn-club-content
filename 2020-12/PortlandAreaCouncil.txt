Our group insurance renewals have been processed and will be sent to State Insurance Chairman Marilyn Schmit very soon.

Past President Keith Miles, along with caller K.C. Curtis are recovering from COVID-19.  Caller Jim Hattrick has been in the hospital for gall bladder problems.

Mary Theirl has accepted an appointment as the new Sunshine person.

There was a discussion about what clubs are doing to keep member’s interested in dancing and reestablish membership.  Frankly, many clubs don’t know how many will return to dancing once it is permitted.  Some of our clubs have had Zoom meetings (to keep the interest).  The Rosetown Ramblers have had city walks.  The Hoppers have done some virtual line dance lessons.

A short discussion was about in person round dance lessons, which are still happening.  Round dancing is somewhat problematical because, ideally, the round dancers would be living together, but some of the round dancers aren’t living together.  Everyone dances at their own risk, however.

Later on, we’ll need to address restarting square lessons.  The thinking is that we all could use refresher lessons, and the PAC would be in the best position to have those lessons for the clubs.  We’ll need to get a slate of guest callers to give the lessons.

We will not be having a Christmas dinner this year.
