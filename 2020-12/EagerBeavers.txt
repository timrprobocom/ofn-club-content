How many things are you putting on your Christmas List?  Did you utter a Thank You for all the people you appreciate on Thanksgiving? for your food and shelter? your and your family’s health? employment? unemployment checks? Many will have their own thank you for something special that has happened or not happened this year.  Now make your Christmas List for something that really matters to you, something that brings a spark of joy.  If you do not celebrate Christmas then just celebrate the season as humans have done for thousands of years because they knew that Spring would be coming soon. 
 Aren’t you thankful the election mess is over?  All that money spent could be better used to improve healthcare, education, and battle climate change.  These are serious problems that are killing us.  It is stressful to wait for results but that comes with the territory if you want a fair election.  In a dictatorship the outcome is known. 
 OK, I know,  I am supposed to writing about the Eager Beavers and their dance plans.  However, we are all hunkered down in our own little circle with masks and outdoor seating 6 feet apart, passing cookies using tongs.  I think you could make a song with that.  
 Please show your appreciation for everyone who is doing their part by wearing masks, washing hands, and keeping six feet apart. They keep themselves and others from getting sick from Covid19.  It is a constant effort but these efforts can also protect us from the flu.  You are caring for others as you hope they care for you.  Thank you again. We will be dancing again!  Keep the faith and keep checking for our start date at www.EagerBeavers.info.
