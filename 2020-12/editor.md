Here in the middle of the holiday season, I do want to give thanks to all of you who keep submitting news and articles.  In my opinion, the more we can keep on doing things like usual, the quicker we will be able to return to normal once restrictions are limited.

I wish you all a Merry Christmas, a Happy Hannukah, and a Joyous New Year.
