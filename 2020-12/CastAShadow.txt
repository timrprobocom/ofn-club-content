Like many other clubs in Oregon we are on hold waiting for the day when we can resume dancing once or twice a month in Hall B at the Emerald Square Dance Center.  Until there is a vaccine available to all—possibly by late spring—we will not be dancing.
Our elected officers all agreed to stay in place for the coming dance year.
We don’t have any news to report.  As far as we know all are well and hunkering down in place.

Stay safe,
