We wish everyone a wonderful Thanksgiving and holiday season. We sure miss our dancers; and look forward to the day when we get back to it!! We are still in a holding pattern; with hopes for January classes - but not sure yet if that will happen.  We are still planning for our wonderful Boatnik Festival Memorial Weekend with Jet Roberts & Rey(Sherry) Garza - will be a wonderful time.  Please put on your calendar. Look forward to when we can see everyone.
