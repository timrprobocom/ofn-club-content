Due to the increased COVID-19 cases in our area, we, like everyone else, are still not dancing.  Social gatherings and even our holidays have changed as a result.

We at River City Dancers want to take this opportunity to wish you a very happy holiday season. , and express our best wishes for the New year. We hold on to the hope that will be dancing again soon.  

A final word to you all “Stay positive and test negative”. Hopefully this shall pass and we will once again be together.
