Elaine Carol Smith (nee Chandler) was born December 10, 1956 in Downey, California, to David Paul Chandler and Alice Audrey Strawl. She died suddenly August 14, 2020 at home in Beaverton, Oregon.

Elaine graduated from Downey High School in 1975 and then attended Cerritos College earning an Associate Degree in Marketing.

Shortly after her daughter was born, she moved to Apple Valley, California, to help her oldest brother run a goat dairy. She raised her daughter and two of her nephews there for about ten years. She and her daughter moved to Ridgefield, Washington in the early 1990s. She claimed that she held most of the part-time jobs available in town, including driving school bus.

Elaine started round dancing (also known as choreographed ballroom) shortly after moving to Washington. Elaine started dating Dennis Smith, a teacher of choreographed ballroom dance, in mid-1997. They were married November 7, 1997 in Vancouver, Washington.

Elaine had completed massage therapy school in 1997 and was licensed as a Licensed Massage Practitioner in Washington. After her marriage she moved to Hillsboro, Oregon to be with Dennis and his five children from a previous marriage. She drove school bus while waiting for available test dates to be licensed as a Licensed Massage Therapist in Oregon.

When Elaine and Dennis married, they agreed to take in any child in need that crossed their threshold. This resulted in their adoption of two brothers in 2002.
In 2004, Elaine felt led to open a healing arts center that included many forms of natural healing. The result was the opening of RoseSprings Center for the Healing Arts in Hillsboro. She was involved with RoseSprings until 2015 when she sold her share of the company.

At the same time, Elaine’s private practice was evolving towards energy healing modalities. She became a Reiki Master and Teacher. She also used cranio sacral therapy with many of her clients. She was highly respected as a gifted energy healer.
She encountered stone grids and subsequently developed her own product line of Sacred Stone Grids selling the products from her new company, Spirit Whisperings, starting in 2009. One line of the products that she developed was awarded the COVR Best Manifestation Product of 2014 at INATS 2015.

Elaine enjoyed being with family. She also loved animals of all sorts. She had quite a variety of pets including rats, mice, a ferret, a dove, and several dogs and cats.
Elaine is survived by her husband Dennis Smith; daughter Audrey Cannon; step daughter Rebecca Bennett; step sons Aaron Smith, Nathan Smith, Tim Smith, and Walter Smith; adopted sons Brian Smith and Johnthan Smith; brothers Tim Chandler, Paul Chandler, and Alan Chandler; nephews Adam Chandler and Andrew Chandler; niece Rachel Hoffman; five grandchildren; nine step-grandchildren; and four honorary grandchildren (any offspring of children’s significant others who ever called her grandma).

Elaine was preceded in death by her parents and a nephew Scott Chandler.
