The happy Hoppers are still treading water here in Vancouver, WA.  We have members who are continually striving to engage our dancers and none more so than Tom and Liza Halpenny.  Their "Let's Keep Hoppin" zoom lessons are a hit with about 16 people/couples.  We also have folks who are trying to engage members with email updates and inquiries about how folks are managing and some are responding to those emails.  Still no word on when we may be expected to dance again with each other---and not just virtually.  
If there is anyone out there who would like to be on the email list for "Let's Keep Hoppin" you can reach out to Tom and Liza.  Tom is the secretary of our club and his contact info is in the new directory.  In the meantime, stay healthy and active.  We'll see you on the other side:-)
