Although our club members are still observing all the mandates of the pandemic, we miss the fellowship of dancing. We have tried to keep in touch with one another by Zoom, small gatherings, and phone calls.

If you visit Lebanon during the holidays, you will see the beautifully decorated Ralston Park (thousands of lights). It is our club tradition to decorate the corner of this park and we are planning to do this again. The Lebanon Square Circlers have participated in this community event for over 10 years. Our club members remain safe and look forward to seeing everyone in a square again. Marilyn York
