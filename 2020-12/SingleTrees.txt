No dance news to report as we haven’t had a dance since we got shut down last March.  We had a get together in September which was enjoyed by all who attended.  Perhaps we’ll need to schedule another one—it’ll have to be indoors and warm though as the weather has sure changed.
 
Stay safe and watch some square dance videos to keep those calls fresh in your mind.  We will get back to dancing!
