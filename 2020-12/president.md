Federation Presidents Message
For
December 2020

December is a month for celebrations and Holiday Parties.  With the pandemic that we are in, my wish is that each of you can find a way with family and friends to be joyous and celebrate the Christmas Season.  The dances we would have had this time of the year will just have to wait until next year, but don’t lose the spirit.  I would have loved to visit your clubs festivities this time of year, but it will have to wait.  We will be dancing again!!!

As the Federation would like to see things back to normal, there are some things that couples and singles can do during this time.  Following the Governor’s guidelines along with the posted Federation’s guidelines, investigate some round dancing that is going on, or a class.  With a safe venue and masks that could be a fun activity.  Why doesn’t someone start up some line dancing?  That should be fun while practicing safe distance.  If any of these appeals to you, check it out for fun and exercise.  There are positive outcomes with being active again.

Some callers are getting together on Zoom to discuss how square dancing will get started again.  Social Square Dancing will take off with lessons as soon as the Governor’s rules change to allow it.  These callers are looking to be unified in lessons so these new club members can visit other clubs and dance with calls they have all learned.  There will be more info on this.  Clubs, talk to your callers to be prepared with a plan once square dancing opens up.

As we look forward to 2021 with a positive outlook that dancing will start again, let’s keep in touch with the rest of your club members and plan some activity within the guidelines to allow everyone the opportunity and the chance to socialize.  It might be fun to guess who’s behind a creative mask.  Make it a fun event for young and old alike.

Stay positive and we will get through this.

Swing Your Partner………….MERRY CHRISTMAS and HAPPY NEW YEAR
