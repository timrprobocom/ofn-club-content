December already?  Looking back, 2020 has been an alternative universe year - the Chaps and Petticoats were active square dancers for only two months (January and February) of this COVID year.  All of us have been innocent bystanders while we watched local, state and national dance and entertainment events CANCEL, like dominoes collapsing.

Our dance hall at Maplewood Grange became a staging area - a place to store furniture, wall hangings and other furnishings while the foyer, stairwells, hallways, air ducts (etc.) were revamped or made new.  The volunteers for these renovations were the Chaps and Petticoats members, also your community grange members.  On a happy note, we are proud and can hardly wait to show off Maplewood Grange’s new face lift.

September is normally a month to renew our Club memberships - though we’ve had no dancing, and only occasional get-togethers - participation has been waning, and so are membership renewals.  We remain a group of interested dancers, enthusiastic neighbors - though the unknown keeps us and finances close at home.  

Speaking of home, our hearts go out to those who lost their homes, possessions, animals and even loved ones to this years’ wildfires.  The greatest blessing is we have each other...

May you end this year with renewed hope, find yourselves blessed, and have the merriest of Holidays! 

In 2021, put on your shoes and let’s go dancing .. soon!
