The Country Cut-Ups own their own dance hall so they don't have to be concerned with their Grange Hall being closed due to Covid.  The club has scheduled two dances that are round dance only that comply with Clackamas County and Oregon state rules with regard to Covid.  We are limited to 25 people in the building, so twelve couples and the cuer.  We have it set up that everyone must come with their own partner, dance only with that partner and remain six feet distancing while dancing.  The first dance was Saturday, November 7th.  There were nine couples in attendance.  The next dance is Saturday, December 5th.  That dance is subject to be canceled, of course, as the virus has worsened and the state is mandating stricter guidelines.  If the flyer and dance information is still up on the OFN, it is still planned.  Text Young Lumsden, info on the flyer, for information and reservations.
