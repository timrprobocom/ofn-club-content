 Oak Hills Squares is still having their bi-weekly Zoom meeting to keep track of what everyone is doing, or not doing, which is probably more appropriate.  We enjoy visiting, regardless.  No one in the group has had the virus or the vaccine at this point.  There are several educators in our group, and they expect to get the vaccine soon.
 We are planning to start round dancing lessons with masks and social distancing as soon as it is permitted, as this seems the type of dancing to have the least interpersonal contact, and we are all itching to get back to dancing!
