On March 11th, last year, the Columbia River Dancers held a really fun dance.  Attendance was down but those there had a good time. Sadly, it was the last one in a year of self-distancing, no touching and masks.
 When will it be over?  I wait for my shots.  I have not been allowed ( my wife is strict) since before Christmas to go to the grocery store.
 Keep the faith!  It will get better.  It will.
