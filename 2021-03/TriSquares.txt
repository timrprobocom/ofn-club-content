 Our board is getting excited about the proposed idea circulating regarding a new level of square dancing, using only the 50 most-used steps and requiring only ten weeks of lessons.  It really makes us hopeful for the future of square dancing while we wait for vaccines.  We are continually talking about the possible timing of our next square dance lessons and of ways to get our club members "refreshed" with workshops, too.  All depending on the pandemic, of course. 
 We have kept up our monthly board meetings over Zoom and also our monthly club-wide chats called "Gabfests."  In March we'll announce our slate of officers at our Zoom General Meeting, and like last year, we'll be voting over email.  Of course, getting back to squares may take longer than we think, so it's really important to keep exercising at home to keep up our stamina!  Let's hope more types of vaccines are approved and the process goes faster.
