It's way too cold to meet outside the hall in the parking lot which gave us a chance to sit and chat with our members and friends.  Inside wasn't an option even with social distancing and masks.  To jeopardize even one member to COVID or anything wasn't worth the risk.  
   
Our caller, Tim Matteson, is now retired from Euphoria Chocolate Company after working for them for 23 years.  Happy retirement, Tim!  Tim is looking after his mother who is in frail health.  Our prayers are with them both.  Tim's mom sewed shirts for Tim.  He found the material.  He's got an impressive collection.  Always fun and colorful.  

Hang in there everyone!
