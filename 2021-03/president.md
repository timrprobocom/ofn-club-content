As I write this I think back to one year ago, when during the middle of this month we were told to shelter in place.  It’s now a year later and we still haven’t been able to dance like we want to.  Sure, we can grab our partner and dance in the kitchen to the radio, or now to a Zoom caller or cuer, but it’s just not the same.  Remember we are all in this together and we WILL find a new normal as soon as we have herd immunity.  Get the vaccine if you are comfortable with that.  It’s your choice!!!!  Being outside in the fresh air is a good thing.  Make the most of what we CAN do during the pandemic, but be safe.  

The callers around the state of Oregon are trying to unify, so that the lessons given will all be standardized when dancing starts again. Therefore, new graduates will be able to dance at any club and be successful.  We need to support this effort that callers are making for our activity.  We are all looking forward to having some fun again.  

The Federation is here to help you and the clubs. Contact any of the Federation officers if there is anything we can do to help.  We don’t have all the answers, but we will strive to find them for you.

As time goes by, staying positive is hard to do, but let me say that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  We have to believe that, and make the most of whatever the New Normal will be.

We should get some nice weather in March, so get outside and enjoy it.  Rains will happen, but so will sunshine.  Keep the smile on your face and greet everyone you see—just like all good square dancers do.  It will make a difference and you will feel better.

Swing Your Partner . . . . Beware of the Ides of March.
