 I am stunned and a little disappointed that we are not getting vaccines as quickly as we thought.  As I sat here at my computer pondering what to write that would not be depressing, I glanced to my left at my very messy bulletin board.  It turns out that over the years, yes, years, I have printed up suggestions for living, a better, more fulfilling life. I thought I would share some of it.  I certainly need a reminder.  I think most Hoedowners live by these homilies.  Why else would we love dancing together, eating together, spending time together, going places together, sharing, giving, repairing and reaching out like we do.  We are blessed.
 1. Not matter how you feel, get up, get dressed and show up.
 2. Life to too short to waste it hating anyone.
 3. You don’t have to win every argument.  Agree to disagree.
 4. When it comes to chocolate, resistance is futile.
 5. Don’t compare your life to others.  You have no idea what their journey is all about.
 6. Take a deep breath.  It calms the mind.
 7. Get rid of anything that isn’t useful, beautiful or joyful.
 8. It’s never too late to have a happy childhood.  But the second one is up to you.
 9. Life isn’t tied with a bow, but it’s still a gift.
 10. Get outside every day.  Miracles are waiting and spring is coming.
 11. Growing old beats the alternative—dying young.
 12. Burn the candles, use the nice sheets and wear the fancy lingerie.  TODAY IS A SPECIAL OCCASION!
 13. Smile and laugh more.
 14. However good or bad a situation is, it will change.
 15. Forgive everyone everything.
 16. Hug often.
 17. Live passionately.
 18. Give generously.
 19. Smell good.
 20. I remember the joy square dancing gives me and will give me again when we take to the floor.
 I hope you and your family are all safe.
