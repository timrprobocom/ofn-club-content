The TVC held our first Zoom meeting in February.  As with most first attempts, things did not go according to plan.  Some of those on the invitation list were unable to connect, including me.  I think most of us now know what we did wrong so it should go better next time.  We did not publish our annual TVC Directory last year due to Covid-19 but we expect have it ready for print as soon as we get a go ahead to dance again. 
 Discussions at the meeting included, future TVC sponsored dances which will remain unplanned until we are dancing, a report that Gary and Norma Sohn were awarded the Randall Award, and some discussion about the new Callerlab square dance program, Social Square Dancing, consisting of 50 moves for Basics and Mainstream.
 Our next meeting will be on Monday, February 22nd at 7 pm via Zoom.
