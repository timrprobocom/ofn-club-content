
We have all endured one of the strangest times in our lives.  No dancing for most of us at all.  I did get to attend one dance in Roseburg in October as Douglas County has often been only in the high risk category and some have opted to dance with masks and stay socially distanced when not in a square.  They are even going to start lessons Feb. 20 from  2 to 4PM.  I think many may need to take those lessons before we start up our dances again.  Contact the Roseburg Buckeroos if you are interested in getting their full schedule.

A few Single Trees, Whirl-A-Ways and one lone Buckeroo have formed our own bubble and are dancing to virtual dances through YouTube.  It is going quite well, and we should not need any refresher courses before we start dancing again.  It takes a bit to get used to virtual dancing, and it is easier with 3-4 people, but it can be done with just one person as long as you know your definitions and can keep the four sides of the square in mind.  Give it a try!

Stay safe and get ready to start dancing again.
