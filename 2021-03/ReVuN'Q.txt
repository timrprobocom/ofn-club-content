Another month has gone by and it is time to write another article for the OFN. The club has not danced since early November, but we would all like to get back in the hall to dance again. However, the dancers get an occasional email just to let them know the status of the club, the hall and anything else that goes on in the Federation that they should know about. 

Mid-Winter is planning for 2022 and registrations will be out soon. The guest cuers are Randy and Marie Preskitt. The guest cuer for 2023 is in rehab for a bad bout of Covid. We send healing thoughts to Barbara Blackford.

We also send our condolences to the family of Regine Anderson from Penticton, British Columbia. She was found deceased in her home in late January. She was short of stature but a great cuer and Oregon selected her round for the Round of the Month for February 2020.
