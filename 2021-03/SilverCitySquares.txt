We received news that the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival has been cancelled for 2021. There were several reasons for this cancellation, including: US/Canada border is still closed; clubs not being allowed to gather for practices and not having locations to practice in; not having a definite location to hold the Festival in.

We are looking forward to and planning to have lessons start in September.
