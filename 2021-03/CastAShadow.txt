Once again I have to report that there will be no advanced dancing in March.  Lane remains in the extremely high risk category and the vaccines have not been rolled out even for all of the 1A group never mind for seniors as of my writing this article.  So we wait and see.  Perhaps by the time I write the next report I'll have something concrete to report.
