title: Thanks from the Sohns

Thank you to the clubs in the Oregon Federation who voted for us to be awarded the Randall Award. It is a great honor to receive this award. Square and Round dancing has been an enjoyable activity for most of our lives and we are missing it now. For those of you who did not know, Norma's aunt and uncle, Dorothy and Ray Murray, also received the Award right after they served as Federation President. Thanks again and stay safe until we can dance again.

Gary and Norma Sohn
