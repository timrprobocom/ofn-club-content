 Hope everyone is doing well, no Covid at least.  We are all waiting for our time to get our vaccine.  VS Members are all well, thankfully.  
 My yard is springing up with Spring flowers, no blooms yet, but should be in full bloom by the time you read this (it's written in February).  Just got back from a "park stroll" with a few of my neighbors.  I live in a senior park of manufactured home with small lots so not a huge amount of gardening, and 15 mph streets.  
 I have been attending Daryl Clendenin's every-other-Tuesday evening Zoom meetings.  Caller Lab has come up with a Social Square Dance program which has 50 calls, a combination of all but four Mainstream calls and the remainder are most of Basic.  They want our clubs who do Mainstream to adapt the SSD-50 for both our classes and dances.  The idea is to incorporate new dancers into our clubs faster, with the 50 movements taught in 12 weeks instead of the usual 20 weeks.  Plus and higher clubs will remain the same.  Our Callers will be able to make the SSD-50 dance just as much fun as Mainstream.  It's really how they put the moves together and the music they use.  Music that makes you move and call combinations that make movements smooth work well no matter what the level.  Let's support our Callers with this new program.  We need new dancers to take lessons and stick around, join our club's and dance, fill our floors.  This is what the SSD-50 is meant to do, boost square dancing.  
 Stay safe,
