The Country Cut-Ups are excited that the Covid activity status of Clackamas County has been upgraded as of February 12th to a point where we can hold round dances safely by taking the prescribed precautions. We are responding by holding three dances in March providing that the activity status remains at that level..March 6th and 27th we will have Tami Helms cuing for us and on March 20th, we will have Julie Stiers cuing. Watch the OFN for any updated information of these dances. As the vaccination process continues and the Covid cases continue to drop, these round dances and square dances will become more likely. Yeah!!
