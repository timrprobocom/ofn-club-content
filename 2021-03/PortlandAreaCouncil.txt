We’re still a little stir crazy over here.  One idea being discussed is putting a couple treadmills in our granges and passing them off as gyms!  But that still wouldn’t answer the question as to social distancing.

It is exciting to see round dancing start up within our Clackamas County club.  I’m sure it will pick up as more are vaccinated.  I first realized I was getting out of practice when I heard some recorded rumba music, then realized I didn’t remember how to do a round dance rumba.  Yes, I actually had to consult my phase three round dance book to refresh my memory!
