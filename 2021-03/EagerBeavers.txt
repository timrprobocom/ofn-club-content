 Who could have predicted something so terribly awful to our weekly dances one year ago, March 9th?  Who could have guessed that day was our last dance and we would be still waiting for our next one?  That is not an anniversary we can celebrate but a day to make a resolution to take nothing for granted.  This is a lesson to savor the good moments and quit procrastinating on doing those things you have wanted to do. 
 All of us seem to be living in a bubble to avoid a serious illness but we suffer from lack of personal touch.  It happens to me.  The bubble seems to be tough but do not let it be.  We are lucky to live in an age of instant communication if we can just figure out how to use it.  It is not the same as meeting friends and relatives in person but Zoom reminds us what is important.  Face Time on your phone works because special moments can be shared in real time. 
 Hope is here and it will be better.  Start planning the places and people you want to see as soon as you get your vaccination.  Make some reservations.  Send some invitations for a Labor Day Party or even a July 4th  picnic.  Surely we will be able to get out and about by then.  On the other hand, I am not a good predictor of events so cross your fingers for good luck. Call a friend on St. Patrick’s Day and wish them the “Luck of the Irish” using an Irish accent and see if they recognize you.  
 In the meantime keep yourself in shape.  Be ready to dance on day one.  Get out and take a walk and keep that body moving.  Keep the faith, we will be seeing each other at the dance and telling each other about our bubble buddies.  Also, check for our start date at www.EagerBeavers.info.
