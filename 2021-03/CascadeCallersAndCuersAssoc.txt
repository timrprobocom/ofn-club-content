Our next scheduled dance is May 29, 2021.  We'll just have to wait and see how things are by then.  We hope we all will have had our vaccinations by that time, and we are back to calling, cueing and dancing. 

The last scheduled dance activity at our hall in Springfield was Christina Corelli's round dance class March 9, 2020.  Little did we know we'd still not be able to dance after all this time..  
 
We look with optimism for the rest of 2021!
Keep on thinking positive thoughts!

Christina Corelli   
Secretary
