Prudy Prunit is still eyeing the big tree in our parking lot, wanting to chop it down.  It bombards all the cars underneath with all sorts of debris.  On the other hand, the only cars parking beneath it belong to the club officers so the general membership is fine with it, not to mention the Grange Beautification Committee.  Update:  At our general meeting, our board awarded Prudy the contract to chop down the tree, all voting “aye” except club florist Gerry Geranium.  The tree will be gone very soon.
