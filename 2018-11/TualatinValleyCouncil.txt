As the Council is encouraging all dancers to attend the anniversary dances of member clubs, we are off to a running start this year.  Some are going dark to attend another club!  The month of September had three anniversary dances; the Wavesteppers, Toedraggers, and TriSquares.  I only have information from the latter two dances.
 On Friday, September 21st the Kinton Grange was rocking with 109 dancers.  The Toe Draggers 43rd Berry Good Anniversary dance was indeed very good!  KC Curtis, Darrell Kalmbach, and George Hermann called a great dance.  Bev Flint and Patty Hermann cued.  Eleven of the thirteen TVC clubs were in attendance.
 Also on a Friday, September 28th, the TriSquares held their 20th Anniversary dance at the Tigard Grange.  Several of the old timers mentioned that the Grange had not had that many dancers in a long, long time.  That number was 132, over 16 squares.  Guest national caller Adam Christman suggested that the dancers checkerboard their squares, a concept new to some.  Sandra Pinion cued the rounds for the evening.  
 Since the OFN is published mid month, you may still have time to plan on the Mix 'N Mingle anniversary dance on October 20th.  See their flyer for format information.  They are dancing Mainstream for this dance.
