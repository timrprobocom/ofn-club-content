Thank you to everyone who joined us for our October dance. We had a lot of fun dancing to Leonard and Frances.

Our November dance is also our Ham Dinner. Please check out our flyer. Dinner is at 7:00 pm and is $4.00 per person in addition to regular dance. Come join us for a great dinner followed by great dancing!

We do have a couple of students this year for lessons. And all of them are youth who are also interested in competition. Speaking of competition - if you have youth in your club who are interested - have them contact Karyn Buchheit so we can get them included! See you in a square. Petrina Buchheit
