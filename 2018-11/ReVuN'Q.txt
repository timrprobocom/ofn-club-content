The new season of dancing is coming along just fine at our club. The new schedule seems to be working well and we have gone from six to eight couples to 11 couples in a few weeks. Hope they continue to attend and enjoy the sessions. At 6:30 p.m., we are working on Intro to Cha and the students are taking it all in and working on mastering the technique of 1, 2, cha, cha, cha. At 7:15, we work on some easy cha and fill in with a few phase 2 dances just to keep up the memory of the steps. Then at 7:45 we switch to West Coast Swing and have to remember the various steps to that rhythm. Whew!!! At 8:30, we let the higher level 4+ and easy 5 have a go at it for an hour. We are covering all levels and the dancers and members seem to be adjusting to the schedule and are allowing everyone to have their time. 

Ken and Dianne Pratt are kind enough to come every other week with Stephanie Lozano and Leonard Snodgrass filling in the other week. Leonard is coming along well with learning how to cue and his timing is getting better with each time he gets on stage. Continued success, Leonard. Stephanie takes constant notes to work on her teaching skills and seems to be getting more comfortable with the educator status she has accepted in our club. Come and visit us to see the fun we can have each week.
	
We will be assisting Ken and Dianne as they host the New Yearâ€™s Eve dance at the Salem Square Dance Center. Details will follow soon. Marilyn Schmit
