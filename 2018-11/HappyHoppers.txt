Surprise! After many years of going dark for our first dance in November, the Hoppers are actually dancing November 3rd . Now that we are in a new hall, our dance night does not interfere with the Royal Romp. So, if you like plus and don’t plan to attend the Royal Romp, why not join us at our new home, the Washington Grange, for a night of plus dancing with our great caller, Jim Hattrick?

November will be our second month of holding dances at the Washington grange. We are adjusting to our new surroundings and adapting to doing some things a bit differently.  However, we still have the same friendly club members, a great caller, and wonderful guests who come to visit our club and dance with us. You can’t beat that combination.

Due in part to our move to a new location and our ability to let people know we are settled in and ready to share our love of dance with our students, lessons are off to a bit of a slow start. This year our club is holding eight week lesson sessions, so, hopefully the next session will see a larger group of students joining our class. We are planning a gently used clothing resale for our students and any other interested square dancers during our lesson time on Monday, November 12th. There is always a large selection of clothes which we sell for amazing low
prices. Our hope is to provide very affordable clothes for our new dancers and anyone else wishing to add to their dance wardrobe. If you have been to one of our sales, you know what a great selection we have. It’s actually a lot of fun to find some of the treasures just waiting to be taken home as your next perfect square dance outfit. We hope to see you at our sale or at one of our next dances.
