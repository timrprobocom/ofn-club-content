Turkey, football, shopping for Christmas and our annual Turkey Burnoff.  Yes, it is that time of the year.  Before we celebrate Thanksgiving comes our celebration of Veteran's Day.  On November 10th Mike and Julie Stout will call and cue.  It is always fun and exciting to have them with us.  
 Then comes turkey and football.  The following Saturday means it is time to get off the couch, tighten up the shoes and get to dancing off some of the potatoes and gravy with Dan Nordbye and Julie Stiers.  It is always a great way to start the holiday season.
 As usual, our dances are plus from 7-8 and mainstream the rest of the evening.  Our dances are at the Hazel Dell Grange.
 The Columbia River Dancers were saddened to hear of the passing of our good friend Dorothy Lowder at the end of September.  She loved to cue and loved to teach.  When she taught she always wanted you to do the moves correctly.  I ask that you take some time to remember her in your prayers.  As you think of Dorothy please also keep Hoyt in your heart as well as he adjusts his life in this difficult time.
