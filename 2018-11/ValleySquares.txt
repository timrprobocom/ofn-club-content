September 1st was our “Back to School” dance, members and guests donated school supplies.  September 15th was “Jailhouse Rock”.  They were both fun dances.
 Valley Squares visited both the Toe Draggers and Tri-Squares Anniversary Dances, September 21st and 28th. It's always great fun and lots of energy to dance to a crowded floor and to visit with everyone.  
 November 3rd will be our Tailgate Party dance with Hot Dogs, Chili and Cheese before the dance.  Scott Zinser will be calling and Connie Clark cueing.  On November 17th we will have a Veterans Day dance with Renee Ruud calling and Connie cueing.  Check our flyers, web site and Facebook for details.
