November may be my favorite month and Thanksgiving my favorite holiday.  Election Day is not a holiday but it should be.  You cannot complain about the politicians if you do not get out and vote for people who will support the issues you care about.  Do not listen to what they promise but at what they have done in the past.  But you know that already. 
 We will be recognizing veterans on Monday, November 12th, for their service here and abroad.  Amazingly we have a few WWII veterans in our club!  They are the tough ones. 
 Nineteen Eager Beavers attended the Toe Draggers 43rd Anniversary Dance plus ice-cream social September 21st.  Three callers and two cuers provided the one hundred nine dancers a variety of Plus, Mainstream, and Rounds so everyone had plenty of exercise.  They needed it because Toe Dragger bakers are awesome and with ice-cream we all took some extra baggage home.  Thanks for a great dance. 
 So you can truly enjoy that delicious Thanksgiving dinner you have to train for it.  Do twice as much dancing as you did last month so you can afford another helping. 
 Reminder that Daylight Savings Times changes to Standard Time November 4th.  It is set your clock back (fall back) day.  You would not want to arrive too early unless food is being served.  
 Even if you work on Mondays, you can join us once in a while; we dance every Monday, even on holidays except Christmas and New Years.  Our three great callers (Jim Hattrick, Daryl Clendenin, and Darrell Kalmbach) keep us on our toes as each week, always seeming to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  We dance from 1:00 to 3:00 pm at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.  Please check for up to date information at www.eagerbeavers.info or OFN website: http://ofn.club
