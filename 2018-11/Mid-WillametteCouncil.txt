Thank you to all the club dancers who attended the Fall Festival on Sept. 29 at the Salem Square Dance Center. Although our numbers were few, a good time was had by all. Thank you, also, to the callers and cuers from the Area for giving us their time. Three squares were on the floor at all times with at least a square on the sidelines.
