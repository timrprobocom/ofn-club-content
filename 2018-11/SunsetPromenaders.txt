Mainstream dances in November are on 3rd with a theme to honor our veterans, and November 17th with a Thanksgiving theme.  We do have a lot to be thankful for when you consider all the weather problems we have seen in the news this year.
 Our dance schedule is 7:00 to 7:30 Intermediate Rounds and 7:30 to 9:30 Mainstream Square dance with a Plus tip at the end.  Mike Stout is our caller, and Ken Pratt our cuer.
 Our three Plus dances in November are the 1st, 15th, 29th with Darrell Kalmbach calling and Ken Pratt cueing.  Dance times are same as our mainstream dances; 7:00 to 7:30 intermediate rounds, 7:30 to 9:30 plus dance.
 If you have not been to our hall before we have good parking on the street or at the bank parking lot across the street.  Our hall has a nice wood floor, a separate dining room, air-conditioning, great callers and cuer, and friendly people who like to see visitors.  We are located in the Odd Fellows Hall, 267 E. Main St. in downtown Hillsboro.
 In November and December, we are having a food drive for the less fortunate in our neighborhood, we appreciate all non-perishable food choose to donate.  Thanks.
  Tom & Janice Sminia
