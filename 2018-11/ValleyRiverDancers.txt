Mainstream lessons, taught by our caller Randy Dibble, are going well with four energetic couples.  Immediately following MS lessons is an “A” workshop, from 8-9:30 p.m., $6. 
 Our 50’s dance in September was great fun despite some of our regular members away.
 Several of our members attended the successful Toe Draggers’ Anniversary Dance, and we had a square and stole a banner from the Sunset Promenaders at their amazing Anniversary Dance.  We are planning a visitation to the M&M's later this month for their MS Anniversary Dance.
 Our October Mainstream Dance is a regular dance, October 26th, called by Randy Dibble and cued by Julie Stiers.  Come out to Newberg for a fun evening of dancing together.  Several members will be attending the Seaside Sashay this weekend.
 Friday, November 23rd, is our Gospel Dance.  Dan Nordbye will be the guest caller and Julie Stiers will be cueing.  This has been an annual favorite for many, and we sure hope you will come out and dance with us!
