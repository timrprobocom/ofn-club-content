Summer has come and gone and we are enjoying the bight fall weather here in the Umpqua Valley! The Buckeroo Barn is busy with many things going on throughout the week. Come join us sometime soon!

Our mainstream class just finished their third week of classes. We have 23 first time students along with a few “reboot” students. They are moving right along and doing a fabulous job. We will welcome them to our Harvest Dinner and Dance on November 17th. Mark Wheeler will be coming from Portland to call the dance for us.

We are getting ready for our 2nd Annual Buckeroo Crafting Bazaar. It will be held on Friday, December 7th from 10-6, and on Saturday, December 8th from 8-4. There will be all kinds of great holiday gifts for all of your loved ones. Mark your calendar and plan now to spend the weekend shopping at the barn!

We are only a short drive down Interstate 5 and we love visitors! Think about joining us on the dance floor sometime soon!

Happy dancing,
Robin Faltersack
