In September it was good to be back in our own dance hall, the Tigard Grange, starting off with a “Luau Dance” saying goodbye to summer.  We finished the month with a tremendous “20th Anniversary Dance” with national caller, Adam Christman, which 132 people attended!  Ten Plus squares!  Also in September we began B-51 and Waltz lessons with Terry Halley and Sherri Clark.  Sixteen students signed up for Waltz, and five so far for B-51. 
 On Saturday November 10th we'll have lots of pie at the "Grateful Harvest Pie Party", and on Friday the 23rd (the day after Thanksgiving) we'll be dark.
