Calling all round and square dancers!  We will be walking in the Douglas County Veterans Day parade again this year on Sunday, November 11th and we would love to have other dancers join us on the parade route.  It is about a 45 minute walk.  We will meet on Fowler Street behind the old library again this year about 10:30 am.  We wear square dance attire if possible and most of us wear something red, white and blue.  If you do not have red, white or blue square dance attire join us in whatever square dance attire you have. If this will be your first year of walking in the parade with us, make sure you wear comfy shoes. There is a slight incline at the beginning of the parade route (hardly worth mentioning) but after that the walk is totally flat.  We hope to have a super great turn out for the parade this year to show our support for the veterans who have or are serving our country.  All square and round dancers are invited to walk with us in the parade.  See the flyer at the Barn or in the OFN for more info.
Please call if you have any questions.
