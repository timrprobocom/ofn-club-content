The Buzzin' Bees are saddened by the sudden unexpected loss of our Dear Friend and Family member Evelyn Kinder.

Evelyn always had a smile for everyone who came to our dance and you could find her at the door and greeting people most every dance night.  She was one of the reasons that the Bees have such great door prizes.  We will all miss Evelyn greatly.
