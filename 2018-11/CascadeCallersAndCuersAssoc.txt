Our next scheduled dance isn't until March 30, 2019 at the hall in Springfield.  7:30 - Pre-Rounds and 8:00 - 10:00 Square dance.  Our callers and cuers will be doing the dance for you.  Please come and join us for an evening of FUN!  Write this date down on your 2019 calendars now.

The callers and cuers always have a meeting at 6:30 before each CCCA dance.

We had a small but very fun dance September 29.  

Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli will be calling and cueing a New Year's Eve dance.  8:30 - Pre-Rounds with Christina and 9:00 - Midnight is Mainstream and Plus with Roger.   We'll do a tip in 2019! Any callers or cuers present New Year Eve will be asked if they'd like to call and;/or cue.  Sounds like a fun way to bring in 2019!  Please bring a pie to share.  The first time we did this there were over 30 pies.  Needless to say we have pies for a few dancers after that!  Weâ€™ll have a fruit and/or veggie tray as well.  Come help us welcome 2019! 

Keep on dancing, calling and cueing for FUN
