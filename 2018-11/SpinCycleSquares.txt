We have a very special dance November 17, a Saturday, with Kris Jensen from Albuquerque.  Please see our flyer.  Kris does an amazing job of calling all levels, and dancers have a great time. Kris will call Advanced from 3:00 - 4:30.  Then we'll have one of our famous potlucks from 4:30 - 5:30.  Then from 5:30 - 8:00 it'll be Mainstream and Plus.  $7 for each session 
We'll also have a Silent Auction.  The Silent Auction is pretty amazing! 
Please join us November 17 for a full day of FUN!.  We'll be in Hall B.  Please park in the back.

We continue to dance Sunday nights from 5:30 - 8:00 at all levels with our competent caller and teacher, Tim Matteson.  We encourage dancers to come dance with us and get more floor time.  Please call our president, David Lajoie at 541-520-7311 or Tim at 541-988-0399 to make sure we are dancing as we go dark once in a blue moon.  We don't want to miss you.  Our dances/classes are always casual.  We always have a lot of food too.  Come for a fun evening almost every Sunday!

We will be dark November 18.

Remember that our hall has a cushioned wood floor. 

Happy Dancing,
