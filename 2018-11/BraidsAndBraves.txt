The leaves are falling and we're back to dancing on the third Saturday of each month at Dayton's Palmer Creek Lodge. We had over two squares at our September dance. We're planning at least one visitation this month, too. Our October dance was Halloween themed and some came wearing a costume. We had a hallowonderful time!

Due to lack of participation, our lessons for this season were cancelled, but our cuer, Sandra Pinion, is continuing her Round Dance classes. Carmen
