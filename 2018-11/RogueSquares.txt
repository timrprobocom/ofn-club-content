Well, it seems that the Rogue Squares find themselves between a rock and that proverbial hard place. Well, maybe not.

On September 22, the club members (6 of the 7 existing members) had a meeting and voted to dissolve the club. There just hasn't been the support and participation necessary to maintain a club the way it was meant to be.

As of October 11, 2018, the Rogue Squares was officially absorbed into the Star Promenaders Square Dance Club.

The Pajamarama will be sponsored by the Rogue Sis-Q Council and remain a "New Dancer" dance.

We will see you all in a square somplace, we are sure.

Take care and God Bless all of you who DID come out to support us.
