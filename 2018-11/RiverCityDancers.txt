Our square dance lessons began on Sunday September 16 and continue at 5:30 PM each Sunday. We have a good class and our students are progressing nicely under the excellent instruction of our caller Darrell Kalmbach.

We continue to have visitations to other mainstream clubs each month. Our last visitation was to Tri Squares anniversary dance. We brought two squares and we were the visiting club with the most members in attendance. It was a fun dance. Our next visitation will be to the Seaside Sashay on Saturday October 27. Look for us in our blue and white club outfits and come join us in a square.

We dance every second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community Center at SE 42nd and Jackson.  Our October 20th dance will be our Halloween dance. Costumes are encouraged but not required. All dancers are always welcome at our dances and we love visitors.  Come dance with us.
