The Charlie's are enjoying having a great group of about 8 new students for their Beginner class on Thursdays. The group is very enthusiastic and seem to be really enjoying themselves.  They recently celebrated their first plateau!!  The Tuesday Plus class is going well with several new dancers and a new couple who recently relocated.  So happy to have everyone join us!!  Advanced class/workshop is on hold while a couple of our dancers are vacationing on the East Coast and we should be starting back up mid-November!

We had 1 dance in October - and everyone had a fabulous time! Sarge & Chuck were the cuer and caller and there were a lot of smiles and happy feet!!  
We were dark for Potato Festival in Klamath Falls; and hope that Charlie dancers were able to head over the mountain to enjoy a great time!!  There is a potluck prior to pre rounds!!! Check out the flyer for more info.
