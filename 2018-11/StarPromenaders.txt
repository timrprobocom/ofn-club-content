Another "Amateur Night" is in the history books. There weren't any prospective cuers on hand, but there were three prospective callers. All did a good job. Since our regular caller was elk hunting, we had a "guest" caller as MC. You may remember him, his name is Wayne Weaver. His lovely wife was in the audience. Thanks Wayne for the help.

Classes are going well. They got off to a slow start, but are going strong now. We even have a couple of dancers who are former dancers and are refreshing the activity.

We will start a Plus class on Monday, October 22nd. Come on out from 6:30 to 8:30 for the class to refresh or learn. We have a great time. Phil is a lot of fun.

Our "Game Night" in October was great fun. The potluck was "An Old-Fashioned Potluck" theme.  There was some good food.  Of course, you and I know, that potlucks are always "good food." Square dancers are some pretty darn good cooks.  At lest on game night, we don't have to try to get out and dance after we eat.  The sound of dominoes on the tables will not allow anyone but the deaf to take a nap after eating.

The next "Game Night" is yet to be decided. We are leaning toward January, but it isn't for sure. We will keep you posted. What a lot of fun we have. Some Friday night when we are having "Game Night" come out and join us. It is a "Hoot." If you don't play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on or if there is some other "Game" you would like to play, let us know. We are open to most any table game.

Wayne's Advances class began on October 10 with a couple of newer dancers. There were also some "refreshing" dancers. The class is from 6 to 7:30pm. The workshop is from 730 to 8:30pm or so.

Quite a few Stars will be present at the Potato Festival in Klamath Falls. I know a great time will be had by all!! Thanks to Denny Fullerton and her crew for putting on a great party.

Square thru 3, no 4, no 5 - oh heck, see you next month!
