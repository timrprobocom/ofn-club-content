<li><a>Lloyd Larson Obituary</a>
<div>
<p>Lloyd Larson, a long-time square dancer in the McMinnville area, passed away of natural causes on August 26.</p>
<p>Lloyd was born in Glendale, California on January 20, 1948 and moved to Oregon at a young age with his family. He grew to become an amazing man and successful business owner of "Lafayette Auto Body", in Lafayette, Oregon. Since then, he had retired and moved to Salem. During this time, he was active in his church at Willamette Valley Baptist Church in Aumsville, OR and involved with his square dancing. In 2012, he moved to Tucson, Arizona to warmer weather. Beloved Lloyd Jeralde Larson passed away on the 26th of August peacefully while sleeping of natural causes in Tucson, Arizona at the young age of 70.<br /><br />Lloyd is survived by one brother, Tom Larson and a sister, Joanne Clay, four children, Wade McGowan, Julie Schaffroth, Jeana McAllister and Kristina Larson and seven grandchildren.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lloyd was a man of God and lived a humble life. He loved to go deep sea fishing, work on cars, square dance calling/dancing and to grow a ton of fruit in his yard; didn't matter if it was a desert, he still made it happen. He loved his family, friends and animals who would keep him company. He was loved by many and will definitely be missed on this God given Earth! Until we see each other again, may Lloyd Rest in Peace with our Father in heaven. PS I'll do my best to bring you that Humdinger that you craved so much! I love you Daddy!<br /><br />Services will be held in Salem at Court Street Christian Church on October 6, 2018 at 1 pm. Located at 1699 Court St NE, Salem OR 97301</p>
