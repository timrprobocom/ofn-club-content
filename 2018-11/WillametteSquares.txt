On their regularly scheduled dance night, Sept. 22 at the Salem Square Dance Center, Willamette Squares hosted the OREGON FEDERATION OF SQUARE AND ROUND DANCE CLUBS. It was well attended with enough people for five squares. Sandy Harris as caller and Jackie Gale as cuer shared the stage with a variety of guest callers and cuers. The food table was laden with an ample variety of choices. Much enthusiastic dancing took place.
With this important event behind us, we are looking forward to our 24th birthday dance which will be Halloween themed, costumes encouraged but optional. The regular Saturday night dance will be dark but The Birthday Dance will be held Sunday afternoon October 28 at 1:30 p.m. at the SSDC. It never fails that we have an enjoyable time at all our dances.
Willamette Squares are foregoing their traditional fall lessons to support the Wagon Wheelerâ€™s effort in offering Sunday evening classes at the Salem Hospital.
Looking forward to seeing you in a square.  Jodee Howard
