Hi Everyone,
Again, don't forget the "Game Basket" to benefit the next "Young at Heart" Dance. This dance will be next July. The precise date and place is yet to be decided. If you have any games or puzzles to donate to this basket, let Lorri or Lois know. All proceeds will go to the "Young at Heart" or Youth Dance.  Lorri will have this basket at all the dances she attends, so you can purchase raffle tickets.

With the demise of the Rogue Squares, the Rogue Sis-Q Council has taken sponsorhip of the "Pajamarama" on January 11, 2019. This will become an annual "New Dancer" dance. The Callers & Cuers sponsor "New Dancer" dances in December and February, so this should be an excellent fit and give the newbies one more arena to practice their newly learned skill.

Don't forget, there is a 5th Friday Council Dance on November 30th at Rogue Valley Square Dance Center on Table Rock Road in Medford. There will be Advanced from 6:30 to 7:30, Pre-Rounds from 7:30 to 8:00 and Mainstream/Plus from 8:00 to 10:30ish. The caller is Lawrence Johnstone and the Cuer is Rikki Lobato. Please plan to attend because this will be a very good dance.

The next Council meeting will be December 4, 2018 at Round Table Pizza in Poplar Square. 

Lois & Lorri
