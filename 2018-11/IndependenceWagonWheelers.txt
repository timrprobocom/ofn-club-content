What an enthusiastic and fun Fall Mainstream Class this year! The Salem Hospital location is awesome, and we are grateful to Salem Hospital for allowing us to hold our classes there. George Hermann, our Club Caller and Mainstream Class Instructor, is well on his way to molding our talented and enthusiastic students into Square Dancers.   You can tell by the expressions on the students’ faces that they are having a blast in the process.  

At press time we are looking forward to spicing up our Saturday November 3 Dance with a Halloween theme. So put on your scariest costume (optional), come on out to the Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall, and join in the fun.
 
Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays at Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall and by all means don’t miss our upcoming special dances:  November 3 Halloween Dance; December 8 Christmas Dance; March 9 IWW Birthday Dance; April 13 Easter dance.  Hope to see you across a square! Dee and Bert Mackaman
