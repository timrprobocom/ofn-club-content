It's November!  And what does November mean?  It tells us that we will go dark November 3rd because of Royal Romp.  That makes it a good night to catch the Royal Romp or to visit another square dance club.
 We will be back November 17th, welcoming you to another fun dance called by Randy Dibble and cued by Jeanine Norden.  It's also time to think about the Canned Food Dance December 15th.  Stock up early to be prepared.  It's handy that there is a barrel at the grange to hold all items until time for distribution.  If you will be elsewhere December 15th, we will be happy to have your food items early or late (or both.)
