 We began our regular dance schedule in September, 2nd Friday and 4th Saturday, changing from our summer schedule on Wednesdays.
 Getting petticoats fluffed and outfits matched is part of our regular dance season, our serious attire consideration.  This is something I hear regarding "modern square dancing".  Some new dancers are not interested in our traditional dance attire which, in truth, is much more folksy than modern.  As we are trying to entice new dancers, we might begin the conversation among ourselves and see if we can begin a shift toward more modern.  What would it be?
 On November 9th we will honor our Veterans with free admission.  Speaking of attire, there should be lots of red, white and blue. 
 The Saturday after Thanksgiving, November 24th, we will try to balance calories from our Thanksgiving feast and exercise.  Thank you, Craig, for always keeping us moving briskly.
