Our Anniversary dance was so much fun, with the help of many visitors!  We counted 109 dancers with a few clubs taking home banners.
 On September 28th the Toeâ€™s had the 2nd largest attendance at the Tri-Squares Anniversary dance.  That just goes to show that Square and Round dancing is very much alive and kicking in Oregon!
 Our dance on November 2nd is a regular fun dance, with Bev cueing pre-rounds at 7:30.  Then on November 16th we will have the Harvest Dance with KC calling pre-plus at 7:30.  Both of these dances are a canned food drive, so feel free to bring along a can or two for those less fortunate.
