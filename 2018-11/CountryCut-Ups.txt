Thankfulness is always fitting for the month in which we officially have Thanksgiving.  We are thankful for having such a great club to work with! We are thankful to be in an area with many great callers and cuers! We are thankful for getting our leaky roof fixed on the Boring Barn! An extra big thanks goes to Marc De La Bruere, Robert Lumsden, and Dan Ragland for their work on the new roof. 
Several Cut-Ups will be attending the Rivco Square and Round Dance Festival in Indio, CA, November 8-11th. Hopefully, they will have a warmer climate, an escape from the rain, and some hot dancing!

We have a great mainstream class going with Scott Zinser and will be hosting a new dancer Jamboree on Dec. 2nd. Come and bring your club’s new dancers and students.

We will be gearing up for Christmas. Traditionally, the Cut-Ups get together and decorate a tree and the Barn for the Holidays. We will enjoy our club Christmas Party on Dec. 15th. We will also be hosting a fifth Saturday dance in December, to plan to come to our all plus level dance with Jim Hattrick. We will not be holding a New Year’s Eve Dance this year.
