 We just had our election of officers, by first announcing the candidates at our General Meeting over Zoom in March, and then voting by email, like we did last year.  (Boy, I sure hope next year we can have a nice dinner out for our General Meeting again instead!)  The officers elected are as follows:  President, Dale Brabham;  Vice President, Gloria Davis;  Secretary, John Prouty;  Treasurer, Edith Prouty;  Dance Coordinator, Lynnea Loveberg;  and TVC Representatives, Carol Roos and Ursula Kuhn. 
 Everything else continues to be on hold until this pandemic improves.  We still enjoy seeing each other monthly on the Zoom "Gabfest" and catching up.
