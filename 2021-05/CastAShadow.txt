Like so many other clubs across the nation and the world, we have no danced in over a year now.  We are trying to organize and see how many dancers would like to get back to dancing.  If enough are interested and willing, we will try to get the word out.  

We dance in Hall B at the Emerald Square Dance Center in Springfield which is located behind the big building at 20th and Yolanda.  We dance to recorded music and top-notch callers.

This reporter had the opportunity to do some virtual advanced dancing with a friend to assess whether I needed to take lessons again or not.  I then went down on the second Friday in April and danced at the Pear Blossom Festival to Charlie Robertson’s fine calling.  We did an hour of advanced, mixing and mingling with dancers from as far away as Seattle.  What a blast!  I don’t need to take lessons again after all (HA, HA!).  Of course that evening Charlie was calling easy A-1.  Still it was great fun and I am anxious to get back to dancing advanced with my friends here at the ESDC.

Hope all of you are doing well and getting back out there as well.
