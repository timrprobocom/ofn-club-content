 TVC Meetings are continuing via ZOOM.   A lengthy discussion of the new Social Square Dance format (SSD) took place. TVC Caller Advisor, KC Curtis said that while each club can make its own choice, it would be better to either all continue with Mainstream or all make the change to SSD. It was reported that clubs who are already using it (B51) have been growing, and it was agreed that fostering the growth of square dancing in Oregon is an important focus in this time of declining numbers.  Other ideas presented were adding the dropped Mainstream calls to Plus lessons, and possibly having every third tip be full Mainstream.
 The topic of requiring vaccinations to attend a dance was discussed without resolution.  It is possible that a "Social Club" may be able to legally require those in attendance to be vaccinated but at this point no one knows for sure.
 The current slate of TVC officers was unanimously approved to continue for the June 1, 2021 - May 31, 2022 year, as follows: Mike Sinclair, President; Jan Amerson, Vice President; Andis Garuts, Secretary; Tammy LeBlanc, Treasurer.
 There is some round dancing starting up on a limited basis. The Hoedowners are holding round dance workshops on the 2nd and 4th Saturdays of the month, with a limit on the number of couples who can attend.  Sunset Promenaders will begin rounds for its club members by invitation beginning in May.  The Seaside Sashay in October is still tentatively scheduled to take place.
