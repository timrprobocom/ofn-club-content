We danced for three weeks in March and did a lot of review of various rhythms to see where we stood after the lock out of the Dance Center, thanks to the Governor. We average around 15 people each week and have room for many more. We are glad to be back on the dance floor getting some much-needed floor time to renew our abilities. We resumed Bolero instruction in April for an unknown amount of time, probably sometime in May.
	
We had a club meeting in April to vote for Federation officers, to decide what to do about club officers, and to plan a special dance or two. We will also decide later when to ask for dues to be paid. 
	
We are enjoying having Randy as our cuer and appreciate Debbie accompanying him when she can. She has been busy training a new puppy. Marilyn Schmit
