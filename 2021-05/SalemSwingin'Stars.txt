The Salem Square Dance Center opened for the month of March so we began dancing.  We are on our regular schedule of the first, third, and fifth Fridays of the month. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, everyone MUST wear a mask or face shield while in the building. Everyone brings their own water bottle and snacks. We are limited to 50 people.

We have danced three times and have had a blast each time. There have been 4-5 squares on the floor. We sanitize hands before each tip and have pool noodles available for more distancing.

We are looking forward to dancing without the face coverings whenever that happens. In the meantime, we will have fun safely. Hope to see you on a dance floor soon.
