March 2021 saw the Hoedowners beginning to emerge and transform back to our old selves; you know, the ones with dances, dinners, and activities while pursuing friendships and fun.  March began with the dogged search for vaccines and I am happy to report several members have both shots.  Thank goodness April will see the availability open to all.
 I was reminded how important square dancing can be in our lives when this past weekend my husband noticed an obituary for ninety-one-year-old Gordon G. Green Jr. in the Oregonian.  Here was a man who was a USMC fighter pilot, an engineer for U.S. Corp of Engineers, an active member of his church but when his two children wrote their father’s obituary, they mentioned how he was “happily wearing bolo ties when square dancing with Mom at the Aloha Grange”.  Think of all the happy memories for the Green family.  I want to get back to making those kinds of memories for all of us.
 What’s coming up besides crocus, daffodils and tulips?  Our round dances on the second and fourth Saturday of the month; practice or brush up 6-7pm, music 7-9pm.  Singles are welcome but you must dance alone for the evening.  Masks and social distancing required.  Square dancing will return when it is allowed and does not violate the OHA guidelines for the Aloha Grange.
 Can’t wait to see you in person!
