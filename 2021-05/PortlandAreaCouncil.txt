You’re all invited to our traditional 5th Friday dance.  See flyer below

At a mere $10 a couple, we’re going to lose our shirts on this dance, but do we care?  Not in the least!  Having fun is priceless!

It’s a dance designed for people who have wanted to get back to dancing, noticed that everything else has opened up, and wondering why we have not also opened up.  Here’s your big chance to return to dancing, all at a risk level that is likely less than going to the grocery store.  So make your reservation and enjoy a great evening of our favorite hobby.
