We are dancing!  Cha classes on Sunday afternoon at 2:30 w/Rod Skinner, Practice workshop Tuesday night at 5:30 w/Rod & Joel, and Waltz/Jive on Tuesday night at 6:30 w/Rikki Lobato.  The dancers are looking good and we have lots of fun!  A monthly round dance party is still in the works, we will keep you posted.  Please check with luvroundancing@gmail.com before you travel to dance with us because occasional cancellations happen for various reasons.  We look forward to seeing you on the dance floor soon.  Stay happy and healthy.
