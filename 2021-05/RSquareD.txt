 We are dependent on Kelso Senior Center reopening before we can plan to dance again.  It’s not anticipated that we will dance until at least September, or even later, depending on when social distancing is no longer required in Washington State.  We are hopeful that most of our students who were taking lessons a year ago will return when we are able to dance again.  It will be a good time for everyone to brush up! 
 Because our club hasn’t had meetings since last summer, we haven’t had a chance to discuss SSD but that will be on the agenda soon.
