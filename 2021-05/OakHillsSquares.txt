 Oak Hills Squares continues to have biweekly Zoom calls to keep in touch, and group walks on alternate weeks for anyone who wants to join.  We are impatiently waiting until the gym where we dance is available.  When it does, we plan to begin with round dance lessons, and square dancing when it is safe. 
 Club officers have agreed to continue for another year, so no changes there.  Our word for the day on the zoom call this week was Ballybrack.  It is an Irish slang word that means to fake the death of an obscure relative or acquaintance to avoid an engagement.  The term was coined after the Ballybrack football club team claimed one of their players had died to avoid a match.  One of the lesser-important words, I think.
