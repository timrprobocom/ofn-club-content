The club is still in a holding pattern - but we are seeing a light at the end!! We look forward to starting up classes and dancing again!!  We hope everyone is doing well.  A few of us attended Pear Blossom last weekend & had a great time!!  Don't forget to keep the 3rd weekend in October (15-17th) open for a full weekend in Grants Pass with Mike Seastrom!! Going to be a great time---all sorts of events happening - in addition to our regular Saturday nite dance with Mike & Rikki.
Hope to see you soon!
