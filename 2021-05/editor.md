As the vaccination rate starts to improve, we are getting closer to restarting square dancing.  If I were a betting man, I'd bet most clubs will be operating again in September.  As I mentioned last month, when  your club decides to open up again, let me know.  We will all have to relearn our habits of creating and distributing flyers.  I can make that a bit easier by "filling in" your regular dances in advance, but I don't want to start that until most clubs are running again.
