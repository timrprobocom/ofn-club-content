Eight (yes-a whole square) Chaps and Petticoats members went square dancing on March 19th at the Salem Square Dance Center - our first event since COVID.  Under Moderate Risk COVID regulations, the independently owned venue was able to comply.  This was a “Randy” (dandy) square dance featuring:  Randy Dibble calling and Randy Lewis as Cuer.  The hall danced Rounds, MS and Plus - it was a joy-packed event with lots of smiles! Great to everyone after such a long time.

Chaps and Petticoats joined the Maplewood Grange general meeting on March 28th to discuss opening up the Grange, to Square Dancing, under Moderate Risk COVID regulations.  In addition to the COVID regulations, local granges follow the Oregon State Grange (OSG) mandates, and OSG is under advisement of the National Grange.

Maplewood has opened to small-numbered meetings, and discussed adding additional events to the calendar.  The Grange agreed to resume rentals for non-contact sports based on maintaining State COVID regulations (including areas to be cleaned before and after, 50% occupancy, masks and/or shields worn, separation maintained, maintaining adequate ventilation, plus the signing of a waiver). Local granges must wait for the risk regulations to open up for Square Dancing, a contact sport.

On a positive note, Portland Area Council (PAC) is having a 5th Friday ROUNDS (only) dance on April 30th this month at the Oak Grove Community Center.  A reservation is required, due to the hall occupancy limitation...see flyer in the Oregon Federation April News under Portland Area Council to reserve.

Happy Feet,
