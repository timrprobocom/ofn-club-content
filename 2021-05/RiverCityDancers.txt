At the time that this article is being written, River City Dancers have not yet returned to dancing. 

Our members have kept in touch by Zoom meetings and phone calls. Members have also been busy with building repairs, re decorating and painting. 

We look forward to the day when we can return to the life we once knew and enjoyed. It has been over a year since we have danced. Will we still remember? Well, just remember that when you get into the square, you will not be alone. There will be seven other dancers there all helping each other. When the time comes, donâ€™t be afraid to try again. 

We will be sure to let everyone know when we begin holding dances again.
