 I hope everyone had a good Easter Sunday.  April 18th would have been our 46th Anniversary Dance, which unfortunately is not being held.
 Considering the problems associated with getting together to nominate new club officers and the voting which follows, it was decided to continue the current slate of officers for an additional year.
 We have scheduled a face to face (with masks) club meeting on June 1st to be held at our dance venue, Aloha Grange.  Currently the OHA restrictions require the Grange to limit attendance to 25 persons.  We will not be dancing, just a club meeting followed by a social period with some cookies.
 Canâ€™t wait to see all our friends together again!
