O­ur next scheduled 5th Saturday dance is supposed to be May 29, but we will see if things have settled down, dancers have gotten their COVID vaccines and the hall board has okayed renting again.  We'll hope for the best.  It's been a year, hasn't it?  Friendships have flourished with social medium though.  We'll keep you all posted.

The one after this one in May will be July 31, 2021.
