Not much news to report from Yreka. We continue to attend the Zoom meetings hosted by Daryl Clendenin. Still lots of discussion about implementing the SSD program. We have been in contact with our local school district as well as the Karuk wellness center. Everything is still on hold. The wellness center is not only governed by the state but also the Karuk board of Elders. They are still in a holding pattern, and are being extra cautious because of the cases throughout the tribe. We have been in contact with the Siskiyou Golden Fair and things look positive for the fair to happen in August. We will be doing demo's possibly at random times throughout the fair and not on one specific night provided we have dancers. We are discussing the possibility of doing demo's in front of our booth rather than between the two buildings. This is still being debated and will need approval from the fair board. We were glad and excited to hear that Pear Blossom went well.
Please stay safe and healthy, keep wearing those masks.
Hope to see everyone soon
Dean & Sherrie.
