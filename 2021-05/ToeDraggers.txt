 Happy May Day Everyone!
 This reporter is feeling very hopeful about the future. Us and most of our friends and family have had their vaccines.
 It’s almost dahlia planting time at our house, with veggie plants soon after that, it really gives your spirits a lift to see things growing and producing.
 Stay safe & don’t let your guard down just yet. Hoping for the day we hear “Square 'Em Up”!
