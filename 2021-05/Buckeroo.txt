Buckeroos

Well...there is lots going on in beautiful southern Oregon! We have begun to have some dances and are excited to be out on the dance floor again. We are requiring that people wear masks and that they bring their own snack as we are not sharing food right now. The Buckeroo Barn is encouraging everyone to get their vaccine, and as encouragement, if you bring your vaccine card you will be admitted to one dance free. If we can get to 90% of our dancers vaccinated, we will be able to lift the mask requirement.

We dance the first and third Saturdays from 6:00 pm until 9:00 pm. These are updated times and have recently changed, so please make note. We are also starting a “no experience” dance from 2:00 pm until 4:00 pm on our regular dance nights. Come join the fun and help introduce square dancing to a whole new group of dancers!

Our Birthday Dance in April was a lot of fun! We had two and a half squares dancing to the wonderful Scott Zinser and Rikki Lobato. Coming up in May, we have our Craft Fair on the 7th and 8th, and our Barn Sale on the 21st and 22nd.

Mark your calendar now for the Buckeroo Round-Up weekend scheduled for June 11th-13th. This year we will welcome Dan Nordbye as our caller and Julie Stiers as our cuer. It is always a highlight of our year and helps us raise money to support our beloved barn.

Happy dancing,
Robin
