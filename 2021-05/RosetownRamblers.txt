The Ramblers are purely a square dance club, so we will be spending a little more time in hiatus. We wish the best of luck to the clubs who are dipping their toe in the water with round dances. We hope to be back on the dance floor soon.

Meanwhile, we are anticipating the return of nicer weather by planning some Ramblers Zambles around Portland. This is a fun way to catch up with club members’ news, while helping with conditioning after our long layoff.

We had an entertaining “Name that Rambler” contest in April. Contestants had to answer 5 questions, and then had to try to guess the identity of the Rambler based on their answers. We had 20 contestants for this game. The questions were:

1. What time zone were you born in?
2. Who is your all-time favorite actor (any gender)?
3. What is your all-time favorite movie?
4. What advice would you give your 18-year-old self?
5. If you had a completely free afternoon, how would you spend it?

One perspicacious participant correctly identified 10 Ramblers solely through the information elicited from these questions. Astonishing! The winner won a free one-year Ramblers membership. And we all learned something new about our fellow members—and will have lots to talk about when we meet again!

Wishing good health and good squares to all!
