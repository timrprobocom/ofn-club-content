We are pleased to announce that our club will start back dancing at the Emerald Square Dance Center in May.  Normally as of this dance year we would be dancing on the 4th Friday of the month but because no other club is dancing yet and the 4th Friday falls on Memorial Day weekend, we changed our date to the second Friday, the 14th of May.  Scott Zinser will be calling for us and our club cuer Jackie Gale will be there as well.  We’ll start with plus at 7:30 and then do mainstream from 8-10PM.  We hope to see many of our dancing friends come join us and celebrate the commencement of square dancing in Lane County—at least dancing to a live caller because a small group of us have been doing virtual dancing off of YouTube.  This has helped keep us sane in this strange time.

We were sorry to hear that Bill Gale, Jackie’s husband, had to have open heart surgery.  He is doing well I understand but won’t be back dancing just yet.

We just recently learned that two of our members tested positive for COVID but only have mild symptoms and will soon be out of quarantine.  I’m sure they’ll be out dancing with us on the 14th of May.

Please pass the word to your dancing friends to come dance with us in May.
