 Writing this report a month in advance is sometimes very difficult.  In these times when we can't dance it's even harder.  Our Members have been in touch and we all feel the same - can't wait to get back to dancing.  We need the exercise, we need the friendships.  Hope you are all doing well and we get back together soon.  Thanks.
