 Something is on the horizon for the Columbia River Dancers. The executive committee met on Thursday, April 1st to discuss what has happened so far and when we might be able to dance again. We also found out how Jim Hattrick is and when he will be back calling for us. We have decided that at this time we are looking for a September opening for lessons and dances as we usually are dark in the summer anyway.
 One good note is that we are anticipating that we will be celebrating our 7th anniversary dance. We have already scheduled Adam Christman. So mark down Saturday March 12, 2022.
 Anyone who is on Melissa’s email list, which includes all of the CRD’s, will be getting a email message of what is going on. So look for it coming soon.
 Stay healthy.
