We hope to be able to rent the hall's parking lot again for socially distanced meetings when the weather gets a little warmer.  It gives us a nice chance to see our friends and get caught up.

Our caller, Tim Matteson, lost his mother recently.  He had been taking care of her for quite a while.  She was on hospice but a short time.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Tim.  He and his mom were very close.

Hopefully, we'll be back to dancing soon.
