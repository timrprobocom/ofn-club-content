Welcome the longest days of the year in June.  If you do not like driving at night this is a good time to go to some evening events.  Plan now to attend the Summer Festival in Grants Pass, June 22-24th, and have a little vacation before the traffic gets crazy in July and August.  Do not forget there are five Saturdays in June so the TVC dance will be June 30th at the Aloha Grange. 
 We have had a wonderful group of students learning plus and nearing the end of their lessons in May.  Welcome these new and well trained dancers.  Both callers and students have been working diligently to perfect the moves.  Our callers deserve some special thanks.  Congratulations to all the new plus dancers and enjoy your new skills. 
 Our Anniversary dance was very successful with our total attendance being 125.  Our callers and cuers were outstanding.  Thanks to all for your great support and thanks to all the callers and volunteers who worked so hard to make the Anniversary Dance so special.  Speaking of special, our retired caller, George Clark and his wife Nancy, were surprised and pleased to receive the Swenson Award for their dedication to our club and support of square dancing.  They certainly deserved the recognition.  
 Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while; we usually dance on holidays.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  "Plus Workshop" noon to 1:15 and our regular dance is 1:15 to 3:00 pm, at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
