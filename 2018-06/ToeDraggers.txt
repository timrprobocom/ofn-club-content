April was a great beginning to Spring and visitations for the Toes.  We have tried to honor the anniversaries of the other clubs in the TVC Council.  There have been great turnouts for these dances.
 May 4th was our Fillies and Lillies / Derby Theme Dance.  Everyone came dressed in their best Kentucky Derby outfits and had a fun filled evening. May 18th will be our regular dance for the month.  KC and Linda and Bev and Harlan will all be there to make sure our dancing will be fun and challenging.
 June here we come.  The club has voted on new officers and they are ready to go.  Thank you to each of you for stepping up to help our club to have a great year ahead of us.  June 1st is our 50’s and 60’s Sock Hop.  I always love this dance because of the fun costumes we can come up with to dance the night away.  Ice Cream Sundaes will be served.  Looking forward to our club June Progressive Dinner to held at 3 different homes on a Sunday afternoon.  Our one clue to the theme is to wear something red.  Should be a fun night with yummy food, wonderful friends and a surprise to what’s the red all about?  June 5th is our regular dance and we hope you’ll come and join us.
 Casual attire is our come as you are for the months of June, July and August dances.  We are trying to beat the heat.  Short sleeve shirts and short pants are what we’ll be wearing.
 July 6th is our All-American Dance.  How about joining us for a good old hometown picnic?  We look forward to our times together and hope you’ll come and dance with us over the summer months.
