The summer weather will bring some exciting dances. In addition to our 1st and 4th Saturday dances, we will be having a special Fatherâ€™s Day Dance with Dan Nordbye and Julie Stiers. Look for our flyer and join us for this Sunday afternoon dance. Dan is a great caller and always a pleasure to dance to. We will also be having a 5th Saturday Dance in June with Jim Hattrick calling and cueing. Come to at least one or more of our 4 dancing opportunities.

If you are worried about the heat, then you will be excited to know we are moving forward with plans for our outdoor dance floor. We want to thank all of you who helped us raise money for this at the Murder Mystery Play and Dance in March.  We will start using it when it is finished on any dance where the weather permits. We are looking forward to dancing under the stars!

Dan Nordbye will continue his series of Mainstream Funshops on Monday nights from 7 to 9 PM at the Boring Barn. He is helping the dancers iron out problem spots and be more flexible in their dancing. If you feel like you need a challenge or you are not yet confident in your dancing, let Dan help you!

In spite of dancing in Boring, the Cut-Ups are NOT boring dancers! We love to have a good time and are happy to have you come out and enjoy a good time with us.
