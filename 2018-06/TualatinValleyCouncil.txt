Our new TVC Board members for 2018-2019 have been sworn in and will take office beginning in June; TVC President - Mike St. Clair (Sunset Promenaders), Vice President - Judy Schnase (Sunset Promenaders), Treasurer - Joanne Switzer (Eager Beavers & Hoedowners), Secretary - Andis Garuts (Valley Squares & Tualatin Timber Squares), and State Delegate - Mary Schneider (Tualatin Timber Squares). 
 The next TVC event will be a very special dance with a very different format.  On the 5th Saturday, June 30th, there will be a Mainstream to Advance event at the Aloha Grange, Scott Zinser calling and Jeanine Norden cueing.  The format is: 1 hour Mainstream & Level 2-3 Rounds w/Plus intro, followed by 1 hour Plus & Level 3-5 Rounds w/Advanced intro.  This dance is co-hosted by the Valley Squares.
 The 2018 anniversary dance attendance record held by the Columbia River Dancers with 115 was shattered by the April 7th Valley Squares Anniversary dance with a total overall attendance of 135!  A return visitation from Kirkland WA helped bolster the total by bringing 21 dancers!  Big dance!!  A week later the R Square D held their Anniversary dance on the 13th in Kelso WA.  Even with 2 inches of rain in 2 hours, 125 attendees braved the weather and the hall was rockin'!  Then on Sunday the 15th, the Eager Beavers had their anniversary dance in Hillsboro.  A mid afternoon time and limited parking hampered things a bit but they too managed 125 attendees!  Next, on Wednesday the 25th, the Tualatin Timber Squares celebrated their Anniversary at the Winona Grange.  Exact numbers are not available but the Grange and parking lots were full!
 Since the OFN is published mid month, you may still have time to plan on the Hayshakers 66th Anniversary dance on May 18th, 7 to 9pm, at the Pacific Grange, 90475 Hwy 101, Cullaby Lake in Warrenton.  Craig Abercrombie calling with Lonnie Sycks cueing.  For information call Sylvia (503) 325-8109 or Kathy (503) 861-2726.
