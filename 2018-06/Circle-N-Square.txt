We had a fun time with our Armed Forces Day Dance with Dean calling. We even had some people from Redding come up and enjoyed dancing with us.
 
Our next big dance is the GOLD DIGGERS Dance celebrating 50 years on Saturday, June 16, 2018 nestled between the Buckaroo Round Up the week before and the Oregon Summer Festival the following week. 
                                                                       
See you on the dance floor.
