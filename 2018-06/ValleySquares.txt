Thanks so much to the square dance community for making our 69th Anniversary such a success.  We had 130+ in attendance. A contingent from Kirkland, WA selected our dance as their visitation.  We were delighted to see dancers we met on last yearâ€™s Mystery Trip. 
 Please join us for our Strawberry Dance June 2nd at Aloha Grange. Scott Zinser is calling & Connie Clark cueing.  We have added a Mainstream Workshop for students and new dancers at 6 pm before our regular MS with Plus on the hour. 
 We expect 50 new dancers to sample our fun activity as Wells Fargo holds a get acquainted dance this month.  Date & location TBD.  Angels are always appreciated.
 In addition to our 1st & 3rd Saturday dances, we will also be hosting the TVC 5th Saturday Dance at Aloha Grange June 30th. 
 New officers are Carolene Siebert- President, Pete Cooper - Vice President, Cheryl Kahler - Secretary, Andis Garuts, Treasurer.  TVC reps are Julie Cooper & Dorothy Reed. 
 Aloha Grange is air-conditioned so please put us on your summer dance calendar.
