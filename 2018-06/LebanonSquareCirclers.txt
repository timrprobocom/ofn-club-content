May was a big month for our club.  May 5 was our Cinco de Mayo dance -- great dancing with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  Tacos were served at break time.  Bill Jeskey was the Master Chef. Some of our members also attended the Teen Festival in support of the Silver City Youth dancers.  

May also means getting everything ready for our Strawberry Festival weekend June 1, 2, & 3. For months we have been collecting items and soliciting merchants for the silent Auction, which is chaired by Kaynor Heineck.  RVs will be coming in on Friday (June 1) and there will be a Spaghetti Dinner for all prior to the dance. Our club participates in the big Strawberry Festival parade on Saturday morning. Then there's a potluck on Saturday prior to the dance on Saturday night.  Our caller will be Andy Garboden from Washington.  Andy grew up in Lebanon and we are excited to welcome him "back home" for our Festival dance.  Jackie Gale will be cueing.  Of course strawberry shortcake will be served at break time. An experienced clothing sale will be another feature of our weekend.  We conclude the time with a Sunday morning breakfast.  It will be a glorious weekend and we hope you all will come and enjoy the fun.  See you in a square!  Marilyn York
