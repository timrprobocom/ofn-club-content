Well. We have had our elections. We voted in March and April and May and I do think that we have an Executive Board.  Mary Moody remains President; Thom Gilsdorf is our new 1st Vice President; Cleve Mosley remains 2nd Vice President; Frances Ramey is our new Treasurer; Dann Houghton has become Secretary and John Olson remains Assistant Treasurer and Hall Rental Officer.. Our thanks go out to Debbi Weaver and Roberta Claudson for their years of hard work and service.  Our thanks go out to the new officers for their promise to deliver more years of hard work.  Well, not really deliver....we all know the amount of work and energy that goes into being an Officer and we appreciate all their efforts.
