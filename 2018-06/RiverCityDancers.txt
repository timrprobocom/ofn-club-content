There has been a lot of fun going on right here in River City. We had guest callers for the month of May.  Dan Norby called our first dance on May 12 and Scott Zinser called our second dance May 19. 

Our club caller Darrell Kalmbach will be back and calling our dances in June. Our second dance in June (June 9 ) will be our club anniversary dance and promises to be a lot of fun .Our retired former club caller Les Seeley  will be coming back for a visit from his home in Arizona and  will be calling our club dance on July 14.  You will not want to miss these special dances. 

Our hall is air conditioned and we dance all summer every second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community Center in Milwaukie. 

Our visitations to other clubs are going strong. We have a visitation each month. We have collected the following banners : Valley Squares, Hoedowners , Tumbleweeds, Chaps and Petticoats, Silver Stars, Columbia River Dancers, Toe Draggers, Charlie Brown Squares, and Prairie Steppers. We welcome these and all clubs to come visit us.

Hope to see you in a square,
Carol Mendenhall
