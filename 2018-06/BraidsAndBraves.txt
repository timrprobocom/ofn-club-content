We had a small but fun crowd for our April dance but are looking forward to welcoming some visitors from other places in June. May was the Alien Days Festival in McMinnville and we hope you were able to join us and all kinds of extra-terrestrials for our dance.  

We will be dark in July and August for our regular dance night, but will be hosting a Community Dance party at the LDS McMinnville church in August to hopefully attract new dancers. Come and join us.

Remember we're at the Dayton Palmer Creek Lodge starting at 7 p.m. on the third Saturday of the month. Come make a new friend.  Carmen
