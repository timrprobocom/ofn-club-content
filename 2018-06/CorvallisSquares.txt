Our Spring dances have been a lot of fun! Our last dance for this season will be June 9, and then we're dark till the second Saturday in September. We have a few demo dances planned for this summer to get the word out about square dancing and how enjoyable it is! 

In June, we will have our members' annual summer kick-off potluck, and talk about plans for the fall. We'll be holding mainstream lessons again, and are already talking it up with co-workers, neighbors, and friends!  Karen
