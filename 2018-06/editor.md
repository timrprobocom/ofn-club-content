With the warm weather, many clubs go dark for the summer months.  Be sure to check the Where & When before you drive to make sure your target dance is still on.

Marilyn Schmit stumbled across a set of minutes from Federation meetings in the 1960s and 1970s.  There are lots of familiar names (Fran Westphal, Ed Warmoth, Buddy Randall).  The Federation changed it's name in 1976 from "Oregon Federation of Square Dance Clubs" to "Oregon Federation of Square and Round Dance Clubs".  At that point, there were 15 councils instead of the current 10.  Many know about the Eastern Oregon Council, the Lincoln-Tillamook Council, and the Sunset Empire Council, all of which are fairly recent losses, but there also used to be a dedicated Teen Council, and a "Three Valleys Council".

I've scanned these minutes and made them available on the
