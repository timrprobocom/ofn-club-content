It is the end of April and I am writing an article for June. 

May is a sad month for us as we say goodbye to our cuer, Cheryl Manley and her husband Geof, as they prepare to move to Blackfoot, ID. Cheryl will finish the Jive class at the end of May. She will be moving closer to her family. They have purchased a house and are working on getting their house in Canby ready to sell. 

The club is celebrating 42 years on June 14. It will be a two-hour dance with Ken Pratt as the MC. Hope you can join us. Maybe Cheryl will still be around so she can attend also.
	
We will have a new schedule for the summer with Cheryl’s departure. On the second and fourth Thursdays, Ken Pratt will come down and continue our Phase 3-4 routine that we are used to from 6:30 to 9:30 pm. The big change will be the first, third, and fifth Thursdays when Stephanie Lozano will step up and take over the cueing duties. She will cue Phase 2 and easy Phase 3’s to bridge the gap between Phase 2 classes and taking Intermediate level classes. Her dance partner, Leonard Snodgrass, is learning to cue also, and will help her instruct any class we decide to have in the fall. The time for Stephanie’s events is 7-9 pm. It will be floor time for all involved and we invite dancers to come and work out some problems with any move that is giving you a fit to do correctly. Floor time will be the drawing point for all concerned. A much needed product for the easy level dancers who need some extra guidance. Marilyn Schmit
