As is customary in our club, the changing of the guard comes with an election in April, followed by the new officers taking over the first dance in May.  This year on stage Lindie Noonan will do one of her fun introductions of caller Randy Dibble.  She is trading jobs with Dan Knierim, seen on stage these last two years introducing Randy and our caller, Jeanine Norden.  Robin Faltersack is now our vice president, while Sue Naven will continue turning out the minutes.  To wind up the list, Rick Faltersack comes on board as member-at-large.
 We continue to enjoy all the folks coming to the lessons, appreciating seeing longer time friends and making newer ones.
 As usual, our special summer dances will be coming along.  Dates haven't been set for sure for the three:  the Red, White, and Blue Dance, the Root Beer Float Dance and our Watermelon dance.  A sweet windup to some great dancing.
