Willamette Squares had a great time at their regularly scheduled monthly dance in April. Since the month of May was just around the corner, we held our Maypole dance. There was fun and laughter over the multi-colored ribbons hanging from the Maypole that had to be woven by each individual person going over and under to the music. Mistakes were made but we enjoyed dancing around the Maypole, and eventually there was a colorful pattern displayed at the top of the pole.  
Sandy Harris was the caller and Judy Russell was the Cuer. A guest caller and guest cuer helped out. Everyone enjoyed the array of food items, and everyone seemed to have a great time!  Jodee Howard
