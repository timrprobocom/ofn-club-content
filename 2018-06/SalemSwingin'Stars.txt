WOW!!! It was an incredible weekend in Silverton at the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival. There were five clubs with dancers from Washington State, British Columbia and our very own Oregon. These kids were (are) amazing. The Round Dancers were spot on, the Callers and Cuers delightful and, of course, the Square dancers. Their dancing was fun to watch. This was my first time at a competition and that is why I say WOW.  Our very own Kailee brought home two second place trophies for dancing in the PreTeen square with the Delta Sundancers from British Columbia and with the Silver Knights Novice square. The Delta group was in need of two dancers to complete their square so Kailee and Jasmine joined them. New friends were made and fun was had by all.

We held elections at our April 20 dance.  Results are:  President - Sheila Machado, Vice President - Richard Smith, Treasurer- Terry McCarty, Secretary - Harriet Livingston, Membership Chair - Danny Rickard, Sunshine - Lanie Rickard, Area Delegate - Manuel Machado, OFN Reporter - Sheila Machado.  Thank you to all who voted.  Thanks also to Silver City Squares who made a visitation to our Birthday Dance. They took home one of the four banners we have of theirs.

We dance all year round. The hall is air conditioned so we can keep it cool inside even when the temperatures soar outside.  We dance on the first and third Fridays of the month. Pre-Rounds begin at 7:00 pm, with Plus at 7:30 pm. Mainstream with Rounds 8:00 -10:15 pm followed by a final Plus tip. If there is a fifth Friday in the month, we will have a Plus Dance.
