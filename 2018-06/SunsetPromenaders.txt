Our June Mainstream dances begin on the 2nd with a Fatherâ€™s Day theme, Mike Stout and Ken Pratt calling and cueing.  The theme for our June 16th dance is Flag Day with Mike and Julie Stout calling and cueing.
The Promenaders Plus dances will be on June 7th with Darrell Kalmbach and June 21st with Daryl Clendenin calling.
 We have had a really good square dance class this year with graduation on May 20th.  Mike and Julie Stout have done an outstanding job this year teaching and drilling them in the square dance moves and the angels have also been supportive of the class.  We have several new club members from our efforts and that is important as our member numbers have been going down in the last few years. 
 We have also been having a good turnout for Round Dance lessons and workshops with Ken and Dianne Pratt instructing.  We have been doing phase 2 two-step, and Cha-Cha in one group and working through Jive in another group up into phase four.  We are about to finish for the summer.  So much to learn and so little time, enjoying it.
 It has been a busy time going to several anniversary dances recently.  The club has a bunch of banners and are eager to return them to their home club, please come visit us we really enjoy visitors.  Have a great summer, be safe, and keep on dancing.
 Our schedule for all dances is Intermediate Rounds at 7:00, Mainstream at 7:30 until 9:30 with a break time following.  Additional parking is available at the bank across the street.  The Location is IOOF Hall (upstairs) at 267 E. Main St. in Hillsboro.  503-805-5867 for information.
