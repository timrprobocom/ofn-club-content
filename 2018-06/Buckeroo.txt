Our annual Buckeroo Round Up is almost here!. The theme this year will be 1950â€™s and we are busy decorating the barn and getting ready to host dancers from all over Oregon. We have some changes this year that we are excited about. There will be contests, meals, and LOTS more dancing. Check out our flyer and plan now to join the fun!

Lessons and workshops are moving forward and going well for us. Our current group of students are moving along quite well and we are looking forward to seeing them out on the dance floor. We hope to see many of them at our upcoming Round-Up!

Remember that we are only a short drive on I5 from both Portland and Medford.  We would love to see you at the barn!

Keep dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
