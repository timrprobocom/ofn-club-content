We had a great time at the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival - we hope that you were able to come and watch some of it. We were blessed with good weather so there were several of the groups taking advantage of that during meal breaks.

Now for the results: Julia Buchheit placed third in Junior Cueing; Yesenia Vallejo-Mourer placed second in Junior Calling; Silver Knights placed second in Novice Squares; Silver Dragons took Champion in Intermediate Squares and we won one of the promotion awards. Our two preteen girls, Jasmine Mauro and Kailee Shields, who helped out the Delta Sundancer's Preteen Square, received second place awards.

People seemed to enjoy the location and the event.  Mom (Karyn Buchheit) will find out for sure about next year at the committee meeting in June.

Thank you to everyone who came to our May dance.  We all enjoyed the spaghetti dinner and we got to check out the trophies up close. Mom took them in to be engraved the next Monday.

We are now dark until our September dance, but we will try to be out some during the summer. See you at a dance soon. Petrina Buchheit
