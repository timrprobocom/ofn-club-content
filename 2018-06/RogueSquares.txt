As you know, the Rogue Squares are on a limited dance schedule. We are having dances only in January and July for now.  We will give this a trial and see what happens.

In the meantime, we are dancing at the other clubs in our Council. Summer Festival is the middle of June in Grants Pass and Stars Diamond Lake Festival is the end of July. We also try to get out of the area and see what the rest of the Square Dance World looks like. There is always Yreka, Klamath Falls or Roseburg. The Gold Digger Dance is in Yreka on June 16, the Buckeroo Roundup is June 8 & 9 and the Potato Festival is in Klamath Falls the middle of October. The list goes on & on.

Our July 20 dance is "Potluck Birthday Party for the United States". The caller will be Phil Ramey and the cuer will be Elaine Funk. The Potluck starts at 5:30. See the flyer for details. This dance is for any dancer who likes a good time and for the recent graduates (both September and January classes). 

We are still working on the future for The Rogue Squares.

See you in a square.
