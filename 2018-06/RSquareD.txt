Our April 13th Anniversary Dance was a grand celebration.  At one point, 11 squares were on the floor.  123 dancers attended to help us celebrate our 65th anniversary.  17 clubs were represented.  Guest callers Jim Raupp and Darrell Kalmbach added their special touches to the dance as did Cuer Ken Pratt.  Our club caller, Craig Abercrombie and Cuer, Lonnie Sycks, as always are considered our best assets for a "happenin' event"!  Thank you TVC for the challenge and encouragement to attend member anniversary celebrations. 
 R Square D brought a square to celebrate Eager Beaver's anniversary dance in Hillsboro the following Sunday.  We brought home one of their banners.  I guess they will be coming back.
 We were dark April 28th, for those Sashayer festivals on the east side and west side.
 Come and join us as we dance the summer away.  Starting in June and continuing through August we dance on 2nd and 4th Wednesdays. During the summer months casual attire is OK if not advisable as we do no have air conditioning.  We continue with our normal format; 7:00pm - 8:00 pm Plus, and 8:00pm - 10:00pm Mainstream with rounds.  Most summer dances involve ice cream for break. 
 For more information about us please visit our website at www.r-square-d.info or friend us on Facebook.  Our caller for R Square D is Craig Abercrombie and our cuer is Lonnie Sycks.
