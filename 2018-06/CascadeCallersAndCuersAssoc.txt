Our next scheduled dance is June 30.  We'll have a CCCA meeting at 6:30 with our new officers in charge.  President - Pat Cox, Vice-President - Jackie Gale, Secretary - Gail Jackson, Treasurer - Christina Corelli.  Pre-Rounds are from 7:30 - 8:00 and then it's squares and rounds called and cued by our members.  The dance ends at 10:00.  We look forward to calling and cueing for you and dancing too!  It'll be FUN!

Then our next scheduled dances are September 29 and December 29.  We'll have to decide whether or not we';ll actually have a dance December 29 since New Year's Eve is just a couple of days later. .

Keep on dancing, calling and cueing for FUN
Christina Corelli
