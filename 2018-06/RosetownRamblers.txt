The Ramblers were thrilled to graduate 11 Mainstream dancers on May 12. Some of our dancers have already been seen gracing various and sundry dance halls in the Portland area, and even attended Mid-Winter. Thanks to all who have given them a gracious and friendly welcome. We’re all in this together!

Our last monthly dance before our summer break will be on June 9 at the Milwaukie Grange. One of our most popular callers, Don Wood from Lacey/Olympia, will be behind the mic. The hijinks start at 7:30.

Finally, we want to put in a plug for our annual three-day dance weekend, Scares and Squares. You can find our flyer in the special dances section of the newsletter. We will be dancing October 26-28, 2018 at a venue that is new to us, but very familiar to many dancers: the Oak Grove Community Club. We will have three internationally famous callers: Mike Kellogg, Kris Jensen, and Gary Monday. Our event features 15 hours of dancing, Friday supper, Saturday banquet, snacks, costume contest, and Ramblers’ hospitality. The cost for the entire weekend is $85. Some people balk at the cost, but if you think what it would cost to go to a square dance convention or even an out-of-town weekend, the cost is quite reasonable. You can sleep in the comfort of your own bed and still dance to some of the planet’s best callers. If you have any questions, please send an email to info@rosetownramblers.com. We hope to see you in October!
