Your reporters are preparing this report on the Oregon coast at Yachats, enjoying IWW's annual Koast Krash - No dancing, but rather a weekend retreat with fellowship, games, and good food. This year's theme is Roaring Twenties.  Members will dress in their Roaring Twenties finery for the Saturday evening banquet.  Thanks to Terry McCarty and Celinda Gourley for chairing. The Koast Krash is always a highlight of the year. 

We are thrilled that our new club cuer, Patty Hermann, is on the job and doing great.  We extend a hearty invitation to all dancers to come enjoy dancing at IWW dances (Polk County Fairgrounds, Rickreall). It is always a fun evening under the guidance of the Hermann Dynamic Duo, our new cuer Patty and her husband/club caller George. By the time you read this, we will have had our Kentucky Derby Dance on May 5, with non-alcoholic mint juleps and a chance for the ladies to wear Kentucky Derby style fancy hats.  

Come dance with us at the Polk County Fairgrounds on the first and second Saturdays of the month. Dee and Bert Mackaman
