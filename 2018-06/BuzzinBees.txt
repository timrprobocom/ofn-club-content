We send you all greetings from the Buzzin' Bees as we are wrapping up for the season. Our last dance before the summer break is Saturday June 2nd with a Hawaiian theme. Practice your hula and come to wrap up our season. Everyone is welcome. We are a mainstream Club but we dance plus every third tip.

Our Hall is not air-conditioned so it gets too hot to dance there in the summer. We're planning to make many visitations this summer and we hope to see you in a square.

We are making a change to our programming yet again as we try to find our happy place. We will be starting preplus on the third Saturday Dance of the month. That means we will do plus starting at 7 followed by mainstream at 7:30 with every third tip being Plus. The dance we have on the first Saturday of the month will still start with pre-rounds at 7.

As we end our season we are looking forward and planning lessons for September. We will start beginner lessons on Sunday September 9th at 6 p.m. at the Hazel Dell Grange. We will then add in plus lessons on Sunday September 30th at 4 p.m. with a break between plus and mainstream.

For the last two summers our caller, K. C. Curtis,  has done square dance lessons one day a week in the month of August at Lakeshore Athletic Club. It looks like he will be doing that again this year. Watch for further information. Angels from all clubs are greatly appreciated because the lessons are usually in the morning. If we don't see you at our Hawaiian dance in June, We Wish You a healthy and happy summer of dancing.
