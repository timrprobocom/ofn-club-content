Congratulations to Karyn Buchheit, Silver City Squares, and the rest of your team for organizing and sponsoring a fantastic Pacific NW Teen Festival this year! We saw kids from 5 different clubs from Oregon to Canada competing in calling, cueing, round and square dancing.  Our very own Silver City youth were amazing – congratulations on your individual and team wins.  Thank you to all of the participants, families, judges, volunteers, and fans.  The dancing was superb, the kids were wonderful, and the volunteers were outstanding – what a great experience! 

Summer Festival kicks off this year on June 22, in Grants Pass.  If you haven’t already registered, please click on the link under Summer Festival in this issue and print out your registration form.
