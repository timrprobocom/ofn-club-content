On April 14th, Hoedowners roped everyone into the Wild, Wild West Dance.  All those cowboy tunes are great for square dancing.  There were lots of cowboy boots and a few plastic pistols in evidence but no one wearing a sheriff badge was around.  There was a tall, dark, handsome stranger hanging around the stage for most of the dance. I heard he ended up in the attic, must not have been “wild” enough for the crowd.  But it was the square dance couples hanging around on the walls, all decked out in their matching, twirling skirts and scarves that caught my eye.  What with all the hee-hawing and boot stomping everyone had a great night.
 We filled the floor for our April 28th Hope to “Sea” You Dance.  Beach balls, mermaids, sandcastles, and shells were scattered about but it was the bathing beauties hanging on the walls that had everyone talking.  Their swimsuits varied from oh, so modest to holy cow!  Those couples may be a little wooden when it comes to dancing but they certainly have been putting on a fashion show in April.  We’ll keep you posted.
 I have to mention this new face that’s been lingering about for the month of April.  Svelte he’s not but oh so cuddly and really quite large for his family.  He’s frequently referred to as “The Traveling Bear”.  He came home with the Wolter's after a April Hoedowner visitation to Sunset Promenaders and you’ll have to watch the OFN as to when your club can claim him and take him home.
 What does June have in store for the Hoedowners?  STRAWBERRIES!  We’ll be dining a la Oregon with our Strawberry dance on June 9th.
 Hold on, wait for this, on June 23rd we’ll be celebrating Parenthood.  Hey, we all had parents and this is our evening to acknowledge moms and dads of all generations.
