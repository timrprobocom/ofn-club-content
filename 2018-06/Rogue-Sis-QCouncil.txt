Hi Everyone,

Summer Festival is just around the corner. 

If there are questions, please contact either Lorri McIntosh or Elaine Funk â€” the Co-Chairmen.

The next 5th Friday Council dance will be on June 29, in Grants Pass with Wayne Weaver calling and Elaine Funk cueing. 
This will be the last time Wayne will call a Council dance before he retires, that is, unless we can catch him on the fly for a dance in the future.

Things are also in the planning stages for the next "Fountain of Youth" dance on July 6, 2018. Stay tuned for more information.

PLEASE support the Council and the Clubs in the Rogue Valley. Everyone needs all the support they can get. Times are "skinny", so, please come out and help by supporting your local clubs. We don't want to lose any clubs because of non-support from the dancers.

The next Council meeting will be June 5, 2018 at Denny's Restaurant on Biddle Road at 4:30pm.

Lois & Lorri
