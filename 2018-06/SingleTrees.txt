In  April on the second Friday Jim Hattrick and Jackie Gale called and cued our “Uncle Sam’s Tax Dance” to some very enthusiastic dancers.  As always Jim called fun squares and joked and quipped as he normally does.  Our 4th Friday dance had Jim Voll calling and Christina Corelli cueing.  Jim called some excellent material to keep us on our toes.  It was lovely to see Joyce Voll there supporting Jim and always willing to chat with friends not on the dance floor.

On April 22 some Single Trees and members of our sister clubs in the EEAC went south to visit the Timber 8’s who were celebrating their anniversary with not only birthday cake (delicious by the way) but also with the Umpqua Valley Boys, Dale Robertson, former caller for Single Trees 1986 to 1996 and Don Marshall who was visiting from his new home in Texas and was also once upon a time a caller for Single Trees when he resided in the Eugene area.  They are always a delight to dance to and it always brings back so many good memories.  The Timber 8's and Buckeroos are such gracious hots.  Do be sure to go visit them soon.

Please come and join us for our Reigning Cats and Dogs Dance, a benefit for Greenhill Humane Society, to be held Friday, June 8.  Donations of pet food and other items relating to the care of pets are welcome.  Jim Hattrick and Jackie Gale will be calling and cueing for us that night so we know it will be a fun dance.
