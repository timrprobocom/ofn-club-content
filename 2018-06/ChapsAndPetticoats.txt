The Chaps and Petticoats went DARK, on May 4th, to volunteer and help the youth host the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival (PNTSDF) in Silverton.  Did you dance Friday evening, May 4th, at Silverton High School?  There were five youth-clubs present and some youth also called and cued on stage.  Did you get to watch the Silverton youth compete, on May 5th, with the four square and round dance Clubs (2 from Washington state and 2 from Canada) at the Festival?  Silverton City Squares put the weekend event together at Silverton High School and WOW, the excitement and energy was infectious.  The level of competition was AMAZING and the novelty of having this Festival in Oregon (first time in appox. 30 years) was so special.

Silver City Squares did well.  In the Junior-class level, the Silver  Knights took second (2nd) in Squares Display, Yesenia Vallejo-Mourer, of Silver City Squares (SCS), placed 2nd as Junior-class Caller and the Silver Dragons (Intermediate class) took the first (1st) place Trophy for Best in Squares!!

Chaps and Petticoats took the Portland Area Council's Bear-Mascot, "Beary PAC Potter" home from the PAC 5th Friday dance on March 30, 2018.  "Beary Potter" was previously awarded to Country Cut-Ups and presently holds Honorary Club Membership with two clubs:  Country Cut-Ups & Chaps and Petticoats.  Would you like to visit "Beary"?  Join the Chaps and Petticoats on June 1st (Scott Zinser calls and Sandra Pinion cues) or come to our "50's & 60's" Dance on June 15th at the Maplewood Grange (Terry Halley calls and Ken Pratt cues) ... "Beary" will be waiting to meet you!
  
If you attend the PAC's fifth Friday dance on June 29th, and have greatest percentage of Club members in attendance, you too can win a visit from "Beary."

See you in square... 
Happy Feet, Betty Chipps
