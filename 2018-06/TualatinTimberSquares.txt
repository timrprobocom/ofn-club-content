Thank you to everyone who came out to support the Tualatin Timber Squares second anniversary!  The attendance was perfect for our grange.  The nacho bar was a hit and our new dancers were able to enjoy the experience of a full house, rounds cued by Yvonne Clendenin and a guest tip by legendary Daryl Clendenin!  The love was flowing and the dancers were glowing!  What a night!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!
 Our classes are continuing on Wednesday nights with mainstream.  We would love your help with angels!  Itâ€™s always nice to have multiple squares out on the floor while teaching.
