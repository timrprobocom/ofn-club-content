Tri Squares are fortunate to have Dale Brabham, past president of the TVC, as our vice president now.  
 In June we're looking forward to our last two dances, on June 9th ("It's a Grand Old Flag") and June 22nd ("Berry Best Ice Cream Social") before we go dark for July and August.  And we're taking a June mystery trip to who-knows-where!
