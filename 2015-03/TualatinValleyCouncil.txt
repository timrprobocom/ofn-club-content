The TVC extends congratulations to Paul and Dottie Swenson for winning the Oregon Federation Randall Award for 2015, the state's highest recognition of service to square dancing.  This the award is intended to honor those dancers who have done great service for the Oregon Federation and for square dancing in Oregon, and especially those who work behind the scenes where recognition is so rare.  The TVC is proud to have them as members of our Council.
Each year the Tualatin Valley Council holds a Presidents Appreciation Potluck to recognize current and past club presidents as well as to present a special award to persons who have made significant contributions in our dance community. This "TVC Recognition Award" was presented to Dale & Kathy Worthington, members of the Hayshakers. They were recognized for their commitment to and leadership of the square dance community.  They have held multiple offices in their club, the Sunset and Tualatin Valley Councils, and with the Oregon Federation at the State level.  Kathy is currently the TVC State Delegate and Dale is the president of the Oregon Federation.  At the National level, this couple served on the 2005 National Convention and chaired the Vendor Hospitality for the 2012 Convention.  With a standing ovation they were presented an engraved plaque and gold bars by Gary Clark, Council President.
 The TVC helped dancers recover from The Mid Winter Festival with our Mid Winter Rebound Dance which featured the calling of Darrell Kalmbach and cueing of Debbie Combs.  Sixty six dancers enjoyed this high energy fifth Saturday dance.  The TriSquares won the TVC banner for having the highest percentage of their club in attendance.
