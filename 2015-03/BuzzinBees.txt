Greetings from the Bees. It is amazing how quickly this dancing season is going. I am writing this after our Sweetheart dance. We had a visitation from R Square D's and it was a great dance. We look forward to visiting them to get our banner back. Our club will be dark on 2/21 because the Grange is rented for a clogging event so it gives us am opportunity for a Mystery trip. March brings one of our most fun events - the Pie eating contest. There will be lots of pie for the contest and lots of pie for the break. Come and eat pie. Will your named go on the Winners plaque?
