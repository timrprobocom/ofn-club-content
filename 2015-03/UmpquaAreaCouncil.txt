Umpqua Area Council hosted our annual New Dancers Dance January 11th in the afternoon.   Chuck Simpkins, instructor for the mainstream students, called at the dance which was well attended by both new students and experienced dancers.  Phil Ramey also called a tip during the dance which was a treat for the students to be able to dance to a caller who was new to them.
