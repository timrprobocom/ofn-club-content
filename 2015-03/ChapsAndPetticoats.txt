	All six of our Mainstream students and better than half our Club Angels enjoyed the excitement of Mid-Winter Festival in Albany, January 23-25th.  Most of our Club members danced to Jet Roberts and Peter Gomez for the first time - excellent choices.  We greatly appreciate all the time, energy and restless nights that go into organizing this event; all your hard work grows our square dance community and we thank you.  
 	Chaps hosted the "Blast-from-the-Past" Tri-council TROPHY dance on February 6th.  Eighty people attended!!  Eight squares hit the floor dancing and Tri-Squares (Tigard club) won the Trophy with 52% of their membership in attendance…what an amazing turn-out.  Oaky Doaks get an honorable mention with 24% membership attendance.  Scott Zinser, our caller, promoted the theme with the entire front of his vest covered in (retired and existing) Club badges and dangles.  Congrats to Tri-Squares; we look forward to your future Trophy-hosted dance.
 	We hope that you just come dance with us and support Scott Zinser and Jackie Gale, caller/cuer at our 1st Friday, March 6th dance.  March 20th is Spring Equinox and our "Spring Fling" dance with Tim Kane calling and Ray Waltz cueing - please join us as we jump into new weather.  
 Happy Feet,
Betty Chipps
