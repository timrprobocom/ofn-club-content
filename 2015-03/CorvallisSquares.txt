In March we're looking forward to our coast trip at Gleneden Beach Community Club and want to mention again that all are welcome! We're dancing both Friday and Saturday nights, March 13 and 14. This has been a longstanding tradition for the Corvallis Squares. It's been fun to have visitors at this dance in past years, including folks from the former Toledo 49ers. 
     Our mainstream lessons are scheduled to wrap up at the end of February. Both the angels and students have had a fun time laughing and dancing together on Monday nights since the end of September when lessons started. We're grateful to Bruce Lowther and Judy Russell for their capable instruction and coaching! Karen
