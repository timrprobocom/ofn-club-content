     Our council dance (Jan 31) had about eight squares -- a big improvement.  Only four were dancing at any one time, but we recognize many go to dances for the social aspect.  The Wild Cards were calling (although only KC Curtis was actually billed) and Helen Halley cued.  Oaky Doaks served refreshments -- great publicity for them.
	The background talk is that some of us wonder if caller run clubs are the future of square dancing.  With fewer dancers wanting to get involved, the caller run clubs may be the viable future of square dancing.  But, even today, there are caller run clubs starting up, irrespective of the fact there are not enough dancers left to populate the clubs we already have (based upon four squares needed to pay expenses.)  Then, too, caller run clubs (for profit clubs) have their own disadvantages for dancers.
	Help Wanted:  We still need a Webmaster, Special Events Chairman and Membership Chairman.  Especially, if you've felt "shut out" at the club level, why not explore the council level?  I did, many years ago, and I'm still here.
