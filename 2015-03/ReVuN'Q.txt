We have finished West Coast Swing and will be working on Classics and other music for the spring. Ray will be working in other West Coast music as we go along.
      We had a board meeting on February 5 to discuss some upcoming changes, so stay tuned for further news as we go along. 
      Our birthday dance is in June and we will start working on some plans in the near future to make it a spectacular event. Marilyn Schmit
