Everyone's Irish this month!  Wear some green and do your best Plus jig down to the Winona Grange on Friday the 13th, where Lady Luck will smile on us as we celebrate St. Paddy's Day a wee bit early.  Jeanine will have us going Round in circles, and Scott always keeps us spinning through the squares!
	 As our name implies, the Recycles are the "greenest" club in the state and we're continuing to collect aluminum tabs from drink & food cans.   Your efforts help Ronald McDonald House to provide needed services for families with hospitalized children; many thanks to our friends who faithfully bring in contributions!
	Please bring your friends to our dances with you, so we can continue having fun together!
