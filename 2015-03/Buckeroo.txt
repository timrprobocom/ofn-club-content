The beginning of January found the Christmas decorations quickly packed away at the Barn and the snowman and snowflakes appeared just in time for the Poor Man's Snowman Dance.  Our Snowman Dance is usually held the 3rd Saturday in January but this year in "morphed" into being tagged the Poor Man's Snowman Dance because our admission charge was only $1.00.  Roger Putzler treated us to a fun night and all six squares had a fabulous evening of dancing.  Our new students were introduced to most of the mainstream calls in time for Midwinter so they were able to head for Albany with confidence and enthusiasm.  Thirty eight dancers, from the Buckeroo and Timber 8 Clubs, made the trip to Albany for the festival and from all reports everyone had a great time.  We are looking forward to our potluck and graduation night coming up in February.  Thanks to the Midwinter Festival volunteers who made the week-end a success! The styling workshop deserves extra "kudos" for showing us some new moves with fancy twirls.  Who says you can't teach an old dog a new trick?
