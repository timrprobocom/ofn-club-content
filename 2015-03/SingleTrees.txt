Jackie Gale and Roger Putzler cued and called our January 9th dance, the Baked Potato Feed.  It was our Newer Dancer Dance, with dancers, guests and angels; a good evening.  We were 'dark' to attend Mid-Winter Festival later in January.
We look forward to our March dances: on the 13th, the Black Cat/St. Patrick's Dance; on the 27th, Lennie Ludiker calling and Jackie Gayle cueing.
