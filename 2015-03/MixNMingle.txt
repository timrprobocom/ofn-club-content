 It was fun loading canned foods into the food barrel at our Christmas dance.  The food is always needed.  
 We started the New Year without the scheduled first Saturday dance.  Randy Dibble lost his voice and couldn't find it in time to call for us.  We were all happy that the lost had been found in time for a rousing third Saturday dance.
