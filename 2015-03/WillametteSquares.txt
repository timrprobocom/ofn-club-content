Willamette Squares concluded 2014 with a lovely Christmas dance. Then they saw the New Year in with their new dancer dance on January 4. It was well attended with over six squares and everyone enjoyed dancing. Then on January 9, seven of the Willamette Squares members attended Silver City Squares' new dancer baked potato dance.
     Willamette Squares went dark on Saturday, January 24, to support the Mid-Winter Festival. A number of Willamette Squares members attended the festival and as can be expected, had a great time! Our club will be back on schedule for February and are looking forward to their next dance, their sweetheart dance. They'll be sure to be dancing their hearts out! Won't you please join us on the fourth Saturday of each month? Jodee Howard
