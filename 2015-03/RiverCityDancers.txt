	River City Dancers had a great time at Mid-Winter.  I was home with  the bug that has been going around, but by all reports everyone had a wonderful time.  Renee Ruud was really delighted as she won Split the Pot at $541.00.
	Our 50's dance is March 21, so get those duds from the past out of storage and come join us.  Poodle skirts and thick hair goo will be right in style.
