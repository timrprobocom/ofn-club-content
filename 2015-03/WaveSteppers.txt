The Wave Steppers are dark over the winter, but we'll be having classes; a new round of square dance classes, taught by caller Joe Wrabek, started Wed., Jan. 28th, at the Tillamook Elks Lodge.  As last year, the classes are free; the Elks are letting us use the hall free of charge.
 Our 2015 dance schedule starts in May.  We'll be dancing the second Saturday of the month on the Dance Floor at Garibaldi City Hall.  About two-thirds of the big City Hall's second story is a dance floor, built in the 1940s for the old Firemen's Balls; there have apparently been square dances there ever since the building was built.
 May 9th will be our New Dancers Dance, with caller Joe Wrabek and line dance instructor Gwen Kiel.  June 13th, we'll have Mark Wheeler calling, and either line dancing with Gwen or round dancing with cuer Connie Clark.  On July 11th, George Clark will be calling and cueing, and on August 8th, caller and cuer will be Harvey Hunsucker.  The September 14th and October 10th dances will have club caller Joe Wrabek and line dance instructor Gwen Kiel.
