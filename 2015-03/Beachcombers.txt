Beachcombers hosted the South Coast Council New Year's Eve dance with Coleeta Quigley and Cherie Cox calling and Cathy Houston cueing the rounds. We had a good turnout and everyone enjoyed New Year's Eve in the Ocean Breeze!

 After cancelling out January dance for Mid Winter Festival, we will be resuming our 4th Saturday dances from 3-6 p.m. with a potluck at 6 p.m.  Come join us for some fun dancing on the beautiful South Coast.  You could even do some whale watching while you are here.
