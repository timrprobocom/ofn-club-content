     Our "benefit dance" for Jim Hattrick (January 14) resulted in $492 being sent to Jim.  However, it wasn't technically a benefit dance, wherein everything was donated.  We merely gave the door proceeds to Jim and paid the caller, cuer and rent from club funds.  Six squares came and it was a lot of fun.
	Our own Jack Grauer was honored at the Evergreen Council dance January 31st.  13 squares showed up.  He also has a lifetime complimentary door pass to our own club.  He has been dancing for 46 years.  Speaking as Jack's home club, we are very proud of him.
	Mary Nelson also has a lifetime complimentary pass to our club.  She's been our member for 22 years, and helps clean up after every dance.
	Our Feb 21st dance was one of those crazy dances where there were more gent's than ladies.  Among our guests, we had Don from Missoula, Debbie from Rochester and Craig from Lola, Montana.  They were here as part of a Mid-Winter warm-up.
