Hello everyone.  What a great time we had at Mid-Winter Festival.  A Great big thank you to George and Patty Herman, along with their committee for a great festival.  Our youngest member, Cheyenne Hutchins--I think she's 12--even got up on stage in the new dancers hall with Chuck Garner to call a tip.  Keep going Cheyenne.  You are going to give him and the other callers a run for their money.
	On another note, we have graduated our mainstream class with 3/4 of them joining our club.  Keep dancing to other callers--this only strengthens your dancing.
	At our last membership meeting we voted to go dark for the July and August, and come back with a bang in September with lessons and another year of dancing.  During March, April, May and June we have Chuck Garner calling our 2nd Saturday dances, and Darrell Kalmbach calling our 4th Saturday dances.  What a great combination of callers who will challenge us and our guests to an evening of fun and entertaining dances.  As usual, Dorothy Lowder is our cuer.  See our website www.www.silverstarssquaredance.org to see a list of our callers and themes.  Plus dancing is from 7-8, and mainstream dancing from 8-10.
	Don't forget our 35th Anniversary dance coming up.  We formed in the mid 80's so we are having an 80's theme dance.  Get those legwarmers out, and don't forget the neon colors and the big hair.
	Happy dancing everyone.
