After a wonderful Mid-Winter Festival, we are back in the swing of things. We had a very nice New Years Eve dance with a great lasagna dinner. A very successful Chili dinner dance and two more fun dances are planned for February. We are also going to try a new dancers class in February and will let everyone know how it turns out.
     Be sure to visit our club on the first and third Fridays of the month for great dancing with Bruce Lowther calling and myself cueing. You can find our flyers posted right here in the on-line OFN. Sandy
