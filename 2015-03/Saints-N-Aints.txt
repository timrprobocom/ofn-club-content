It looks like everyone enjoyed Mid-Winter and we are looking forward to next year's festivities.
South Coast was well represented on the dance floor!

There will be an afternoon dance at The Oddfellows Hall in Bandon on Sunday, March 22, from 3:30 -6:00 pm. This is not an Area Dance - just a fun afternoon with friends! 

Mark April 18 on your calendars!  That will be Saints-n-Aints 37th Birthday Dance and we hope to have a lot of dancers on the floor.

Happy Dancing!
Linda
