We had a few make it to the Mid-Winter Festival in Albany, they had lots of fun. 
	We enjoyed our PAC dance with K.C. Curtis calling and the next day was the Emerald Council Dance honoring Jack Grauer, Les Seeley calling.
	We will be having a Valentine's Dance on February 13th and with that we will be having our amazing chicken dinner. 
	Don't forget the Green for the St Patrick's Dance on March 13th, we will be welcoming back Jim Hattrick as our Guest caller. 
	Hope to see you in our Squares soon.
