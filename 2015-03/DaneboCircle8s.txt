Several members attended Mid-Winter and were on committees as well.  We enjoyed the festival and thought it ran especially well.  We heard comments from Jet Roberts, the featured caller, and also from Peter and Chama Gomez, the featured cuers,  about how well things had been planned, how smoothly the festival went and how well they were treated.  They were made to feel like family and appreciated it.  Make a good impression and people remember and relay that to others.  Of course, if we do the opposite that gets around too.  Thank you one and all for putting your best foot forward, making everyone feel appreciated and making a difference.
We are having a Chinese New Year's Dance February 21 with Lennie Ludiker calling.  Lennie and Sheila always come to the Chinese New Year's dances dressed very Asian.  It's pretty awesome.  Dancers are encouraged to wear something Asian-like, but whether you do or not, the dance is always FUN!  Christina is cueing.
Jim Voll is teaching lessons for all of our clubs on Wednesday evenings at 7:00.  These have already begun, but we encourage people to come anyway.  We always needs angels.  Angels make the learning process more fun and a lot less challenging.  See you Wednesdays at 7:00.
