The Hoedowners' Black and White Sparkle Dance was certainly an elegant way to start the New Year.  The temperatures may have been mild but inside we were celebrating the sparkle of frost and snow.  The ballroom's lights were dimmed while a myriad of twinkling lights reflecting off dozens of glass balls.  Our silhouette dancers were outfitted in their formal best and the dining room was glittering with silver table clothes and table runners.  Thank you to all the dancers whose attire matched the black and white, shine and shimmer of the evening.
 It was a wonderful weekend in Albany this year at the Mid-Winter Festival; Dance, Dance, Dance.   We want to recognize Mike and Sally Duyck who were chair people of the TVC Visitation Committee.  We thoroughly enjoyed Randy Lewis and Debbie Olson's performance of a lovely waltz to "Valentine's Day" at the Showcase of Rounds.  Daryl was busy this year calling in all three halls, multiple times and a thank you to Bob and Nancy Oswald and Clay and Kelly McCaw for carrying our banner in the Grand March.  We were delighted to see so many of our new dancers joining the fun.
 Our social committee had several Hoedowner activities planned.  We had large groups for our diners Friday and Saturday nights.  Robert Mahler and Beth Procassini deserve hugs and cheers for hosting the post party festivities both nights and an amazing 42 Hoedowners gathered for our club photo.  Memories made, friendships strengthened, laughter, laughter, laughter; who could ask for more?!
 What's up with the Hoedowners at the Aloha Grange in March?  On the 14th we're breaking out the pedal pushers and lettermen's jackets for our Rock n' Roll Dance and on the 28th we'll be having a Spring Fling.  Join us as we usher in the new season.
