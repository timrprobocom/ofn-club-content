Nine New Dancer Ambassador bars were presented on Feb. 8 to some of our new dancers at the last MWA New Dancer dance, hosted by the Salem Swinging Stars and the MWA. Although only three squares were dancing, everybody had a good time. Thank you to the MWA club dancers for supporting our new dancers.
