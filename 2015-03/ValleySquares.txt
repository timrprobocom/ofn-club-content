  Put on your smiles and dancing shoes and join our new dancers at our Jamboree Sunday, March 15th, 1:30 - 3:30, Aloha Grange, Chuck Garner calling.  We also hope to see you at our dances March 7th and 21st.
 Basics and Mainstream classes started January 13th and we have 13 students.  It is fun to see them master the moves and grow in confidence.
One of our members, Vicki Fotheringham, is battling cancer.  As a fundraiser for the club, and as a personal goal, Vicki has challenged us to pledge money for each dance she is able to attend from now until June.  Her oncologist definitely sees a difference in Vicki's numbers when she is dancing, and Vicki feels it as well.  Thanks to all who are contributing.
 The two January dances were fun, especially since our Plus graduates joined us on the floor, along with guests from Rosetown Ramblers, Hoedowners, Wave Steppers, and Tri-Squares.
