Greetings from Benbrook, Texas, just SW of Fort Worth.  Kathy and I took off on a road trip the 11th of February.  We drove down to Lake Havasu City, Arizona, for a few days.  While there we went to a square dance to see if there was anything different or unusual about their dance.  I hate to say, but it was just a typical dance.  We hope to go to a couple  of dances in the Fort Worth area to see if they do anything different to make their dances more fun and enjoyable.  From here we will go down to Gainsville, Florida, for a couple weeks.  We are looking forward to doing some dancing there.  I will let you know in the next month's OFN if we find anything exciting. Be Bold, Try Something Different.
