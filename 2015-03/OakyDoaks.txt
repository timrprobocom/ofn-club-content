Ladies - it is our turn to 'lead'!  Be inspired by Li'l Abner and come dressed to invite the men to dance at the Oaky Doaks "Sadie Hawkins Dance" on March 7. It is our first Saturday dance, so in addition to rounds from 7 until 7:50pm, we will have a Plus mini-teach.  
	And two weeks later (March 21), bring carrots and apples or bags of sweet feed and learn about the Horse Rescue program one of our members supports. We won't be horsing around of course, we'll be dancing.
	The 5th Friday PAC dance saw the launch of our 55th Anniversary Dance - Elvis "Fun in Acapulco" Dance.  Scott Coon, an Elvis Tribute Artist and Square Dance Caller from Seattle will headline the festivities.  Starting at 4:30 pm with a Floor Show, followed by a Mexican meal and then we will be dancing the night away.  Tickets are available from members.  $7 for either the Floor Show or the Dance and $10 for the entire evening.  So, if you remember Elvis in the "Fun in Acapulco" movie, it will be a chance to dance down memory lane.  And - if not, then a chance to 'meet' him up close.
	When you are out and about in the next weeks, watch for the Silverton youth square dancers.  They are fundraising for their planned trip to the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival in Langley, BC in early May.  Perhaps you'll be able to head out to Waldo Hills on the 8th of March between 2 and 4 for their fundraising dance and see them strut their stuff.
