We sincerely enjoyed dancing with new and old friends at Mid-Winter Festival in January.  The Toe Draggers were so proud of KC (Linda) Curtis in KC's fun calling and Bev and (Harlan) using their special cueing skills to organize and choreograph a round dance for the "Show Case of Rounds". Then a week later, at our own Kinton Grange, was the TVC Rebound Dance called by Darrell (Erin) Kalmbach and cued by Debbie Combs.  What a relaxed and fun ending to a great month of dancing.
 We have been enjoying our tours through different countries around the world with the Toes at each month's dances.  February has been fun dancing, while touring through Italy ending with a delicious Italian spaghetti dinner, and topping it off with chocolate desserts for the break. Yum!!!  We have been having delicious dinner meals before special dances and outstanding snacks at our breaks all year.  We dance off the calories.  In March we are looking forward to dancing through Ireland and maybe learning an Irish Jig.  Our Irish Rubber Ducky Dance on the 20th should bring many smiles.  Come and join us, we promise some fun times.
