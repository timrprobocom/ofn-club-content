Our square dance lessons are ongoing and we have several "already have danced before" couples which is good.  We have a dozen students and Mike Stout our caller and instructor is doing a good job of moving right along, giving them a lot of moves.  The students are doing well, keeping up, and enjoying the lessons too. We are hoping to finish lessons in 16-weeks and end up having several graduates that can dance well.  Our youngest student is only 5-years old and she is doing well.  Three of her sisters already are dancing so she wants to learn too.  
 Our Plus Promenaders dance is going well on the first and third Thursdays; Intermediate level Pre-Rounds at 7:00 until 7:30; the Plus dance from 7:30 until 9:30, and a break afterwards.  Darrell Kalmbach is calling and Ken Pratt is cueing.  All you Plus dancers come visit us sometime soon.
 We want to invite all you dancers to come to our dances.  The Sunset Promenaders have a Mainstream dance on the first and third Saturdays of the month with Mike (Julie) Stout calling, and Ken (Dianne) Pratt cueing at the Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall, 267 E. Main St.  We have Intermediate Pre-Rounds from 7:30 until 8:00 and Mainstream dance 8:00 to 10:00 with a break afterwards.  There is street parking and also across the street is the Premier Community Bank to use for additional parking.  
 The Holidays are a busy time, lots of fun but maybe too busy; so now we can settle down and enjoy a more leisurely schedule of dances, etc.  
 God bless you, and hope to see you across the square soon.
