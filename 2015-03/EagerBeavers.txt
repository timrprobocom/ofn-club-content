 The founders and supporters of square dance everywhere, Dottie and Paul Swenson, were honored and deservedly so, with the Randall Award at Midwinter.  They have been involved in dance for over 43 years and were the founders of the Eager Beavers (Dottie was the original caller) at the Elsie Stuhr Center 40 years ago. Midwinter was popular with the Eager Beavers with about twenty attending and enjoying dancing to a  new-to-us caller, Jet Roberts, from Antelope, California.
 I learned the Resale Shop did well which is a good thing.  It is run by volunteers and the profits benefit the state organization as well youth and new dancers who can pick up free outfits that have been donated to the shop but not sold.  Everyone benefits so next year bring in the outfits you do not wear anymore.  
 March means St. Patrick's; do your "Wearing of the Green" to our dance on March 16th.
Spring begins March 20th so I will expect you to wear spring flowers March 23rd. 
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00-3:15 p.m. (rounds from 1 to 1:30) at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW  Cornell Road in Beaverton.  Please check for up to date information at www.eagerbeavers.info.
