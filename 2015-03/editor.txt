We have just started the process of handling refunds for those people who had unfilled
subscriptions to the printed OFN.  All subscribers should be receiving a postcard shortly
describing how much of their subscription remains, with instructions on how to request a
check.  Because of the overhead of processing a whole bunch of small checks, we are asking
that those with less than a year remaining consider leaving that amount in the Federation
as a donation towards our future expenses.

At the OFN table at Mid-Winter, we had a document explaining how to get your information
into the OFN.  A reprint of that document is available 
<a href="/content/ContributingToOFN.pdf">for download here</a>.
