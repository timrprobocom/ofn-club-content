 The Start of the New Year always brings excitement for the time ahead. This year is no different and is starting off with a renewed hope for us to bring the excitement of Square Dancing to new dancers young and old alike. 
 R Square D had their Snowflake Frolic on January 9th with everyone coming in from the cold to warm up to the calling of Craig Abercrombie. He heated up 4 squares of dancers in record time. It was followed by many different kinds of winter warming soups and good fellowship. 
 Our club meeting was hosted by Cliff and Charlotte Houghtlen on January 19th, at the Kelso Senior Center followed by some tasty pecan cinnamon rolls. Thank you Sandra Holderby for filling in for Dick Sims, our president, while he is away on vacation. 
 March starts us off with a B51 dance on March 13th with guest caller Richard Lane and kicking it up to the oldies with a 50s/60s dance on the 28th.  It's always a good time, come join us.
