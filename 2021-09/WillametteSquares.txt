Despite the heat, Willamette Squares held their July dance at the Salem Square Dance Center. The air conditioning worked fine, and everyone was comfortable dancing in the cool of the room. 

Having not danced for some time during the pandemic, we decided that it would be beneficial to all of us to have an opportunity for some review. Therefore, it was decided to hold two workshops at the Salem Square Dance Center, from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., free of charge to anyone and everyone who would like to participate on August 8 and 22. We hope those of you who are interested in brushing up on your dancing skills will be available to take advantage of these two workshops. 

Willamette Squares is happy to be hosting regular dances again!
