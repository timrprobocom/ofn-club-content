We are presently walking one week and meeting by zoom the alternate week on Monday nights.  We hope to be dancing again shortly.
 We will be dancing on Mondays from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm at the Recreation Center on 158th in Oak Hills area. Lane Clem is our Club Caller. We dance mainstream with some round dancing. We will have beginning classes in the fall for the first hour of the dance.
