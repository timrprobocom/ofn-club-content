We will finally start dancing in September, but with a change of format for this month only. Our hall isn't available on September 4, so our first dance will be on Sept. 11 at the Square Dance Center. This is the Federation meeting weekend and IWW will be hosting the dance and our own George Hermann will be installed as Federation president.

Our second dance of the month will be held on September 18 in our own hall at the Polk County Fairgrounds; Plus workshop at 7:00 p.m., mainstream dancing from 7:30-10:00 p.m. The door fee is $6.00 per person.

Lessons will start on September 12 at the Polk County Fairgrounds from 6:00-8:00 p.m. George will be teaching the new Social Square dancing format which includes 60 moves in 12 weeks. The new dancers could graduate before Christmas and we could potentially start a new class in January. Lesson fee is $6.00 per person. LaVerne
