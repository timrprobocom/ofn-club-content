## September is square dance month!

We have an embarrassment of riches this issue.  We have notes from both the outgoing and incoming Federation presidents, and we have two thoughtful articles from the venerable Daryl Clendenin.

I had hoped this would be a joyous issue documenting the return of square dancing in Oregon, with most clubs starting back up again, but the recent reinstatement of the indoor mask mandate is going to put a damper on that.  Several of our facilities have restricted operations again.  Be sure to watch here and on Facebook for last-minute changes in the dance schedules.

I have some concerns about getting the OFN back on a regular schedule.  Until the shutdown, I was automatically creating dance entries for the "regular dances" for all clubs.  I haven't done that for about 18 months.  It appears that many or most clubs are going back to a normal schedule in September, so I have started the automatic creation again.  However, I know a number of clubs will not be starting right away.  **If your club is not restarting in September,** please let me know so I can mark your dances "dark" for a while.
