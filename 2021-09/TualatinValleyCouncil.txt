The July TVC meeting was held via Zoom.  We will continue the Zoom meetings through September.  A new venue or the re-establishment of our previous agreement will need to be pursued so that we can resume our meetings in person.
 Our Vice President, Jan Amerson, has completed editing the TVC Directory and it will soon be sent to the publisher for printing.  This effort has been difficult this year because of the changes due to Covid.
 Each year the TVC hosts the Hahn Barn Dance.  Unfortunately we had to cancel it this year but plans are being made for next year.  The TriCouncil dance on October 30th is being hosted by the TVC with Darrell Kalmbach and KC Curtis calling with Tami Helms cueing.  A location for this dance is not set at this writing.  More details to follow.
 September marks the month where nearly all of the TVC clubs will resume dancing, some with refresher or workshop tips, and with at least two clubs even offering fall lessons.  All are accepting visitors.  See individual club reports below.
