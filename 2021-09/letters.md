title: Whence SSD?
---
The pandemic has taken its’ toll on our activity in more ways than one. It would be surprising if we didn’t lose dancers due to a large variety of reasons. loss of partners,  health issues, thinking that they can’t remember how to dance, time devoted to other things just to name a few. You can add to that the fact that clubs that were struggling to survive before the pandemic either won’t try to return, or will find it more than difficult to resume their programs. Let’s face it, over a year and a half away from the dance floor is devastating. Many of the clubs will be gone. Honestly, many of the clubs were struggling to survive before the pandemic. It’s going to take a lot of effort and significant time to revive and rebuild our activity. Can we do it? I honestly believe we can. It won’t be easy, but it can be fun.

During some of the worst time of the pandemic, some of our Oregon Callers and Dance Leaders met to discuss the issues that we are beginning to face at this time. Most of the discussion revolved around what is known as the **SSD** Program, the **S**ocial **S**quare **D**ance Program. It’s a program that limits the applications expected to be taught to new dancers. That, along with removing a handful of movements from Basic and Mainstream, is intended to shorten the teaching time enough to accommodate more than one class per year. This new program which has been accepted by Callerlab is working nicely in many areas around the country and should be considered.

After a lot of analyzing and discussion with callers and dancers, my opinion is that we can accomplish the same things while maintaining a viable Mainstream Program. The two things that I think are important are, limiting the extended applications of the movements, and having multiple starts to classes. There is a variety of ways to accomplish those two goals. I hope the Callers and Dance Leaders can resume discussing ways to make those two things happen.

Check out your club membership. No, I don’t mean what’s on paper. I mean those that you can count on being back when they feel it’s safe. I would suspect for many, the count will be half or less of what it was pre-pandemic.

I know that many of the clubs have a target date of September for getting back to dancing and promoting new dancer classes. That’ll be nice if we can safely make it happen. 

Let’s assume the virus spikes, begins to decline, and allows for at least a cautious return to dancing. That’s a pretty wild assumption, but let’s make it anyway. Can your club financially handle the shortage of income? I’d hazard to say, most won’t. I’d guess that many of the club’s pre-pandemic, were already struggling to keep up with the expense of conducting their regular dances. What can we do to help those groups survive? The TVC lists 13 clubs in the Federation Directory. I think that four of them are at serious risk of not being able to continue. The PAC lists nine. One of which has already closed and a few others that for a variety of reasons, might. That is just talking about the Metropolitan area. 

When and if the dancing resumes, it’s going to be very, very important for anyone that wants to see the activity survive, to visit the other clubs. Some can maintain for a short time on their treasury, but can they keep going long enough to recruit, teach and graduate a couple of classes of new dancers?  Even if you start the new dancer class in September, it’ll be after the first of the year before they can be included in the regular dances. Multiple classes will almost be necessary just to recover, let alone maintain. 

Clubs will need to mount a concentrated effort to visit each other as much as possible. A square of dancers visiting just might make the difference. Callers, Cuers and dancers need to sit down with each other, crunch numbers and see if there is anything that can be done to keep from bankrupting the club. The loss of another club affects everyone. 

We can do this. It will need everyone to be on board and active.
