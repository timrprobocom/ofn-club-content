It was good to be back at our home location for our July 9th Plus dance with guest caller, George Hermann, and Leonard Snodgrass as our Round Dance cuer.  
Our July 23rd Dance Under the Stars was a big success with Darrell Kalmbach as our guest caller and Leonard Snodgrass as our Round Dance cuer.  It was a lovely evening under the stars on the tennis courts in Newberg and we drew some interest from passersby and neighbors in the area.  It was so good to see our square dancing friends who we have not seen in a long time it seems.
 We had our 5th Saturday Advanced Dance on July 31st at the Woodburn Estates Clubhouse with Randy Dibble as Caller.  It was good to have you back Randy!
