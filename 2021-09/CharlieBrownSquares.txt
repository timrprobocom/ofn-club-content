The Charlie's are dark in August. We are looking forward to starting classes in September. Starting Thursday, September 9th, we will be offering Mainstream FunShops from 630-8pm and a new Plus class for new Plus dancers and those that need/want to review. The Plus class will be from 8-930pm.  Our 1st SSD class will be on Tuesdays, starting September 14thfrom 630-830pm.  We don't have any dances scheduled for September due to Labor Day weekend and RV Rendezvous happening the 3rd weekend.  Lots of fun planned for the remainder of the year, though!!! October we will have Chuck & Sarge providing the entertainment for our 1st Saturday dance(flyer should be out next newsletter).  Then Oct 15-17 is the Miles of Smiles Weekend with Mike Seastrom! See flyers for all the info. I've also included an additional flyer with all of the events happening.  Going to be a great weekend; and a long time coming!! Can't wait!  November we have Roger Putzler & Mike Sikorsky on the 1st/3rd Saturdays. Our 54th birthday dance will feature the wonderful Pat Carnathan (he did Boatnik several years ago); and finally our last dance of the year will again feature Roger Putzler - he is very excited to be calling a Christmas dance - something he said he never gets the chance to do. Should be fun!!  Flyers for the remaining year's events will be out soon.  We hope that things improve soon so we can see your smiling faces on the dance floor.
