We enjoyed having a Fifth Saturday dance, July 31, 2021.  CCCA members had a meeting beforehand and then a dance from 7 - .  Roger Putzler, with his new knee, came and called along with Pat and Cherie Cox, Sandy Harris and Janet Geiger.  Round dance cuers were Christina Corelli, Sandy Harris and Cherie Cox.  Our treasurer, Gail Jackson, attended the door and had a chance to kick up her heels and have some fun.  We were fortunate that every person in attendance had been fully vaccinated.  We had three squares of dancers, callers and cuers.  Our next scheduled Fifth Saturday CCCA dance is October 30, 2021, and, of course will have a Halloween theme with costumes encouraged but certainly not required.  Mark this date on your calendar for more FUN!  
We aim to please!
