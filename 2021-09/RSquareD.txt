 Many R Square D members gathered July 17th at Pat Faires’ home on Mayfield Lake for a club meeting and picnic.  This has been an annual club event for many years, where we barbeque and socialize in a beautiful outdoor setting. 
 The club decided to begin hosting dances and lessons in September.  We will “warm up” Wednesday, September 8th, with Plus from 6:30 – 7:30 PM and Mainstream from 7:30 – 9:00.  We are not charging for this workshop/dance evening, but will have a donation can at the door. 
 Regular lessons will start the following Wednesday (9/15) at the same time (Plus from 6:30 – 7:30 and beginner’s class from 7:30 – 9:00). 
 Our first dance of the year will be Friday, September 10th, and the theme is “Back in the Saddle Again”!  The Kelso Senior Center board requires non-vaccinated people to wear a mask in the building and there will be an abundant supply of hand sanitizer.  Looking forward to dancing with many of our friends again!
