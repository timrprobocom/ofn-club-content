We have been dancing this summer but have only managed to get in one dance a month so far due to the heat wave in June and not being able to rent the hall one time in July.  Each dance has been done to recorded tips by Darryl Lipscomb who calls at a level just right for our group at this time as we regroup after the COVID-19 pandemic hiatus.  We are limiting our dances to only dancers who have been vaccinated and are willing to sign a waiver before dancing with us.  As of Aug. 11 we are also requiring everyone to wear masks in line with the Governor’s mandate for indoor gatherings.

We are expecting to dance on August 15 this coming Sunday, as I write this, in Hall B of the Emerald Square Dance Center located behind the building on 20th and Yolanda in Springfield.  We are expecting about two squares of dancers.  The next few dances we will aim for will be on Aug. 29, Sept. 5 and 19 as long as we get at least a square affirming their intention to dance and the hall is available.  Please get on Fred Beisse’s email list if you want to hear about our dances in advance and be able to sign up to come.  On our website at cas-sd.yolasite.com, you can contact CAS by filling out the form on the contacts page.

Hope to see you in a square,
Gaynor Hintz
