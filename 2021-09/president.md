This is the time of year for installation of new officers for the Federation.  As President, I just want to say that the past year was unlike any other that a president has had to face.  My goal during the pandemic was to remain positive, and write articles that gave encouragement that we would get back to dancing.  Currently, we have achieved that goal, and with this month all clubs should be starting their new fall schedules.  What a ride it has been!  

On Sunday, September 12th, the Federation will meet at the Salem Square Dance Center in person with all officers, delegates and guests.  Part of the business will be the change of officers.  Attend if you wish, and watch as I move to Past President, and George Herman takes over as President of the Oregon Federation of Square and Round Dancers.  I want to thank everyone who endured the Zoom meetings and got your reports in before the meetings.  You officers and delegates were AWESOME!  Thanks to each of you for your support during this non-normal time.  Please give the same support to your next set of officers.  We are all volunteers and give back in this way because we want to!!!

Barring any rise in Covid cases, we can go on as usual and enjoy this activity that we all love.  Take time to thank your callers and cuers for hanging in there and for working to bring us back up to speed after such a long time away from dancing.  The calls and cues will come back to you once the music starts.

Swing Your Partner and have a Good Labor Day weekend!

Wow, over 35 years of dancing and calling in this state and I am writing my first letter for the OFN!  Here it is September and I will be installed as the President of the Oregon Federation, going to be an exciting time.  Never thought, when I started dancing, that I would be in this position.  I am looking forward to seeing how we can build our activity back up after being off for so long.  Kudos to Gary Clark for leading the Federation through this long dark journey. This last year plus has shown us we can adapt and try new ways of communicating. And it has worked!!

Some clubs have already started dancing and have had some success. Others are not starting up until this month. Sadly, two clubs have decided to fold, a loss we can ill afford. Since some people are still nervous about coming out and socializing, it is going to be a gradual build up until we can incorporate our dancers back. I am hoping that, if your club is starting classes this month, you have availed yourself of the information put out by Kathy Roberts.  If not, please do so, she is our state publicity chairman and has published some great information on advertising and promoting classes.  I think that will be key to getting dancers back and bringing in new people to become members of the clubs.

Now we are starting to see more restrictions coming back. Hopefully they will not impact us as much as they have. We will think positive.  Please follow all guidelines and safety protocols for your area.

Hope to see you on the dance floor soon.

When life boxes you inâ€¦ Square Dance !
