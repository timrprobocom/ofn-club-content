The Sunset Promenaders are doing well. We are having our regular scheduled dances and the have been well attended. We dance at 7pm on the 1st and 3rd  Saturdays at the Odd Fellows hall in Hillsboro. Also our Promenaders Plus Danceâ€™s are on the 1st and 3rd Thursday, at 7pm at the same location. The best part is our Secretary, Dianne, goes to the hall early and turns on the air conditioner for your comfort.
 We do not require masks at this time, but you are welcome to wear one if you choose.  Of course, we will continue to follow the mandates from the Oregon Health Authority and the Governor's office regarding masking. Most of our dances have had at least four squares which has been awesome. Through August our Saturday  mainstream dance will be Darrell Kalmbach calling and Tami Helms cuer.  Starting in Sept 2021 our Saturday Mainstream dances, Mike Stout will be calling and Julie Stout will be the cuer. Our Plus dances on Thursday the caller will be Darrell Kalmbach and the cuer will be Tami Helms.        
 The Promenaders have a lot coming up including our club camp out in September which is always well attended. We are also helping put on the Seaside Sashay on October 22-23 2021.  We will have the signup info at our hall with ribbons.  Dianne Pratt and Gary Clark are handling the signups so if you are interested in going contact Dianne or Gary or come to our dances and we will get you signed up.
 Hope to see you all on the Dance floor.
