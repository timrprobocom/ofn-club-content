Hot August Nights?  We have had enough all summer long!  Eager Beavers are fortunate to have an air conditioned hall at the Aloha Grange.  Come stay cool and dance every Monday from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm.  Daryl Clendenin and Connie Clark are the first and fifth Mondays. Darrel Kalmbach and Jeanine Norden have the second and fourth Mondays.  Jim Hattrick will return for the third Monday in September (we are praying for this Jim).
 A special celebration on Saturday, September 18th, at the Embassy Suites for our Centurion, Paul Swenson,(100yrs young) is scheduled.  Call Sally Duyck, 503 645-2414, if you plan to attend.  
 September 9th will be our picnic at Noble Woods, Hillsboro.  For up to date information go to our website www.EagerBeavers.info
