The Hayshakers are coming back to life! Our first post-pandemic square dance will be held on Friday September 17th at 7:00 p.m. with Mark Wheeler calling - it will be more of a workshop than a dance.
 Square dance LESSONS will begin on Sunday September 26th at 3:00 p.m. with Mark Wheeler instructing.  All Hayshakers events take place in the Pacific Grange, 90475 Highway 101 in Warrenton.
