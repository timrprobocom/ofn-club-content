In July we had a free dance to welcome everyone back. We had only one dance in August and it was the day after our state mandate requiring masks in all indoor public buildings. I am pleased to report that the dance was well attended by members of River City Dancers as well as guests from Hoedowners and Valley Squares. Three dancers wore face shields and all the others wore masks. The hall’s air conditioner kept us all comfortable in spite of the hot outdoor temperature that evening. We ended the month with a club picnic in a member’s beautiful back yard.

It was stated in last month’s club article, that we would be back on our regular schedule in September but that too has changed for the month of September. We will have only one dance in September and that will be the third Saturday in September. That is September 18. Please join us. We look forward to dancing with you.
