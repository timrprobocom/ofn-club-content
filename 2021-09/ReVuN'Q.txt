Hello to all of you. Hope that your summer has gone well and that you have more or less survived the heat that has been provided for all of us.

We are starting a step-up class for those Phase 2 dancers who are ready to move up to easy level Phase 3. The class will be on Thursdays, from 6:00-7:00 p.m., and will have rumba, or cha, to start with. The cost will be $5 for the lesson. Starting date is September 9, 2021. Check out the flyer in the OFN.

The intermediate level dancers are working on finishing West Coast Swing and have not decided on what to teach at our 7:45 p.m. time slot for the fall season. Check the OFN for upcoming flyers on what will be taught.

Our summer sessions have averaged between 6-9 couples each week and they have been comfortable with no masks required, just recommended for those who are unvaccinated. We have held two Saturday evening dances that have been very enjoyable and relaxed. We will see what we can come up with for a fall dance in October or November.
