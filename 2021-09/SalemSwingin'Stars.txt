Salem Swingin' Stars club is now dancing our regular schedule of first, third, and fifth Friday dances. We begin at 7:00 p.m. with Pre-Rounds, 7:30 p.m. for Plus and 8:00-10:00 p.m. Mainstream with Rounds, followed by a Final Plus tip. We have really enjoyed the dancers from all over the valley. It is a pleasure to see your faces across the square.

We are planning our Annual Corn & Cluck Dance for September 17. Stay tuned to our Facebook page for updates. Salem Square Dance Center is air conditioned for your dancing comfort.

See you on the dance floor.
