We started dancing in the middle of June, the second club in our council to do so.  Some weeks, however, we were dark because of the heat.  (We don’t dance if the temp reaches 90.)

At our board meeting, Aug 18th, most members expected us to close down because of the emergency mask mandate of the State of Oregon.  Instead, our board voted to continue dancing, even with masks, and our visitors also pledged to support us!  We will also be having our lessons, per this magazine.  The first three lessons will be free.

We had a guest from southern California, caller Bob Grigsby, who came with his own cheerleading squad!  Never missing a beat, our caller/cuer person was right there to collect his information.  He’ll probably be one of our callers for next year.
