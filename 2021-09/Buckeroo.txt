Lots of warm days here in the Umpqua Valley! We are dancing once a month during the summer months. Our next dance is our “Hot August Nights” dance on August 21st. Our Barn Sale has been postponed until September due to the extreme temps. Keep an eye on our website for dates and further information.

Our new set of lessons will begin on September 18th. If you know anyone in our area looking for some fun exercise, make sure to send them our direction!

We are just a short drive south from the Portland area, so plan to join us in the near future. Beginning in September, we dance the first and third Saturdays and always enjoy having visitors. We have members of all ages and are a family friendly club.

Happy Dancing,
Robin
