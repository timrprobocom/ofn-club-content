We are back to dancing! We are enjoying our hall which has been painted over the summer as well as getting some other needed maintenance.

We are still in the process of auditioning for club caller and cuer, but we are hoping to make a decision by the end of the year.

We danced in the Homer Davenport Days Parade in August, mostly our youth, but we did have fun.

Lessons have started for us - more info to come.
