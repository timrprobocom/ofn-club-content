In a burst of optimism and hoping the pandemic doesn't interfere, at our July board meeting we lined up the coming year's events for our club.  We will have workshops on Sunday afternoons at the Tigard Grange for our Tri Squares members only; for Square Dance/Plus review (Sept.12 - Oct. 24,  3:30 - 5:30), and for Round Dance review (Oct. 3 - Oct. 24,  2:15 - 3:15).  New Social Square Dance lessons for everybody will begin Sunday Jan. 2 - March 27, (3:30 - 5:30). 
 Our regular  dances for the year (2nd/4th Fridays) will begin at our grange on October 8th, with Terry Halley calling and Sandra Pinion cuing.  We will miss our normal September anniversary dance this year, but we do plan to have our Mardi Gras dance in February. 
 Also, we've gotten so accustomed to board meetings on Zoom that we plan to continue doing that, which saves time and travel for everyone.  Here's hoping the Delta Covid-19 variant doesn't get in the way!
