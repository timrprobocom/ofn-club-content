The Columbia River Dancers are in a state of change. On August 1st The Hazel Dell Grange board voted to permanently CLOSE the building, citing a variety of reasons including furnace and roof repairs, repairs from a recent break-in, and back taxes.  Club officers met with their board in an effort to assist them in getting the necessary repairs and their other problems under control but it was to no avail.
  The club has not giving up hope as we are seeking other ways to keep the club dancing. To that end the officers of the club have met with the Manor Grange officials and are close to an agreement to dance in their hall. We have tentatively made the following arrangements with the grange. We will dance on the first and third FRIDAY of the month and will have round and square dance lessons on SUNDAY evenings. Again, this is tentative as we seek input from our club members. The reports we have received so far are positive. I stress that no final decision has been made yet. I will say that in discussions with our caller, Jim Hattrick, he is on board with the times and days.
 Our Secretary, Melissa James, has a list of members and friends of CRD to which she emails news about our club and future dances in the area. Look for her emails as we believe this will be the major way we will get word out to the square dance community. We are currently looking to start dancing on September 17th. That is NOT set in stone, however.
  The club had a picnic/annual meeting in July with 24 in attendance. The officers have been recruited to serve another year.
 We look forward to having the square dance community come visit our new home. Until then, remember in a turn through you use your inside arm to turn the person facing you.
