Our club got back into the swing of things in May, holding Sunday afternoon “refresher” dances for Mainstream and Round dancing, at the Tigard Grange, open to all dancers and requiring masks. (Unfortunately my husband caught Covid on Mother’s Day from our little granddaughter, so we missed out on the refreshers.)  Also in May some of our club members made a visitation to the Toe Draggers at the Kinton Grange and reported a wonderful time.

In July Tri Squares will be dark, due to lack of air conditioning.  But our board members continue to meet and to plan for the fall with great anticipation!  We will see you then and most likely before at some visitations.
