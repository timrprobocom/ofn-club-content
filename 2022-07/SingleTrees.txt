We had one dance in May, held jointly with our sister club the Whirl-A-Ways on May 14, a Saturday night, their regular dance night.  It was our annual Mexican Fiesta Dance with a taco bar before the dance started.  We all brought th e makings of tacos and Gaynor grilled the different tortillas so they were nicely toasted and warm.  Whirl-A-Ways provided lots of chicken and Larry and Gaynor brought hamburger seasoned with taco sauce.  There was all the usual toppings supplied by various members from both clubs.

Mike Kious called and Christina Corelli cued.  No masks were required but thee were lots of bottles of hand sanitizer available.  It was so much fun to dance with our friends and some dancers we had not seen for a couple of years.  We hope to keep everyone dancing and see more come out to join in on the fun.

Single Trees will continue to dance the 4th Fridays of the month with our next dance being on June 24 with Jim Hattrick and Jackie Gale.  We will not dance in July because of Diamond Lake weekend but will definitely hold a dance the last Friday in August although we still do not know who that caller will be.  Jackie will be cueing of course.

Please join us for a fun night of dancing from 7:30 to 10:00 at the Emerald Square Dance Center in Springfield.

Keep on dancing, everyone.
