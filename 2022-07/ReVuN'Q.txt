The club has been dancing from 7 to 9 pm for the month of May and for the rest of the summer or at least until Randy has had his hip surgery. June we are going dark from June 16 to the 30th while some members attend the national square dance convention in Evansville Indiana. Our attendance has been lower than normal, so a break while some are gone is a good financial decision. We will resume dancing on July 7 and host the Trails End dance for Summer Festival on July 14. Hope you will come and join us for some fun before the Festival starts the next day. Come to Salem and have some fun with friends.
