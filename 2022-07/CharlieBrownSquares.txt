Classes are going great and we look forward to graduation for the next group of dancers before we go dark for the month of August. We have one dance scheduled in July on the 30th as we will be dark for the 4th of July weekend and also dark for Summer Festival.

We had a wonderful Boatnik Festival and hope you will mark your calendar next year for our festival with Joe Saltel and Randy Preskitt!! Memorial weekend is always a fun time in Grants Pass!!

We hope to see many of you here in GP as we love visitors!

Happy dancing!
