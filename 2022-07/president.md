July is traditionally the month for picnics, barbecues, fireworks and celebrating our country’s independence. I thought that we could be back to some semblance of normal this year, but it looks like COVID is rearing its’ ugly head again.  A few clubs (including mine) have had to cancel dances because of it. As if we hadn’t had enough bad luck these last two years.

By now the National Convention in Evansville is history and we are looking forward to two big festivals here in Oregon. I am talking about the summer festival in Salem the 15th through the 17th and the Diamond Lake festival the following weekend. Hopefully you are planning to attend either one or both!!   We will have to see how this COVID thing affects the turnout.

I am still being optimistic that we can pick up in August and classes will be successful starting in September. I hope your clubs are aggressively promoting classes and working on bringing in new dancers. This is what we need to help build up our dancer base.

Hope to see you in a square soon and…..
