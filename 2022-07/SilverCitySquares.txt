We graduated 25 dancers on May 3 with 21 of those being youth dancers. So, we will be dancing through the summer!!! With all our new graduates, we decided to go ahead and stay dancing. If the weather is too hot for us to be upstairs, then we will move downstairs and dance in our basement.Â 

We will also be having waltz lessons during the summer. Julia Buchheit has agreed to do these on Tuesday nights. We are hoping that our turnout for lessons equals the number who indicated interest when we asked. Lessons will be 7:00 - 9:00 p.m. starting June 21. There will be one mainstream tip and then line dancing around 8:30 pm.

There is quite a bit planned for summer - two parades, concession stand at summer festival, and whatever else we can come up with.
