The Valley Squares celebrated our 73rd Anniversary on May 21st!  We had attendance of over seven squares of dancers, both guests and members. Our energetic caller was Craig Abercrombie, and the rounds were cued by Connie Clark.  There were two club visitations, from the Sunset Promenaders and the Oak Hills Squares; both clubs received banners.  The Sunset Promenaders went dark to attend our dance, a tradition for many years as we dance on the same night.  Both visiting clubs brought their callers, Mark Wheeler and Mike Stout, and both did a guest tip each. The Promenaders cuer, Julie Stout, also did a couple of rounds, and, at the end of the dance, Mark and Craig did a duet together. Plenty of fun at this event.  Thank you all for joining us in our celebration.  

Come join us for our July 16th  Red, White & Blue dance and let's have fun together.
