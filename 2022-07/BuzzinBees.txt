The Buzzin’ Bees' last regular dance before the summer break was held the first Saturday in June. The Bees have decided to dance this summer on Saturday July 2nd and August 20th. Both the dances and potluck will be held at the Bellcoff farm located in Brush Prairie, Wa (11308 NE 149th Ave, Call Roy Bellcoff for directions 360-892-2908). Bring your favorite dish for the potluck. The dance will be casual.

We are looking forward to seeing lots of our friends.
It is with sadness we report the passing of long time Buzzin’ Bee member Pam Williams.  She went to be with her Lord and will be truly missed.
