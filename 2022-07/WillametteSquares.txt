Willamette Squares enjoyed its May dance, Briskets & Burgers. In addition to our own caller and cuer, we were pleased to have several guest callers and cuers. Along with juicy tender cuts of brisket, we got to sample handmade cheese that our caller and cuer, Bruce & Judy, crafted and brought back from their recent trip to Switzerland. For the additional cruises they have planned, we wonder what they might be bringing back to share from the next excursion!

We are encouraged to report that some of our club members who are undergoing health challenges seem to be holding their own or improving.

We are looking forward to our June dance, the 4th Saturday at 7:00 PM at the Salem Square Dance Center. The theme is Baseball, so come wearing your favorite team’s jersey and/or cap and run the bases or hit home runs in every square in which you dance! ⚾️
