The Oak Hills squares continue to meet every Monday at the gym in the Oak Hills neighborhood.

Lessons are from 6.30-7.30 and mainstream dancing is from 7.30-8.30pm.

We currently have 9 people taking lessons and they are progressing nicely and more importantly having fun. Our goal is to get them ready for a dance near the end of June where we can all go as a club and really introduce them to the world of Square Dancing.  It is very exciting to have some new members and see our club growing.

Our caller is Mark Wheeler, who is doing an amazing job teaching our new members; adapting and evolving the lessons to make it fun and entertaining.

Over the summer we will be contacting our members each week to find out if we will have a square for the Monday dance. If we do, we will dance, if not, we will go dark that week. If you would like to join us, then contact Linda: linda@kitchinonline.com to find out if we will be dancing that week. We would love to have some visitors from other clubs. 

On that note however, we do remain a fully vaccinated club and wearing of masks is optional.
