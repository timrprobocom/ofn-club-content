Congratulations to our thirteen new dancers! Five of them are YOUTH!

We graduated 13 students from our Mainstream Lessons on June 1, and we had a great time at our Potluck and graduation festivities. The new dancers were all invited to come to our dance on that Friday and also to join us for our visitation to Independence Wagon Wheelers on Saturday June 2. Our next set of Mainstream Lessons will begin the second Wednesday in September.

Randy Dibble will continue with a Plus Workshop on Wednesday's from 7:00 - 9:00 p.m. through the summer months. We dance all summer long except that we will go DARK for July 15. We hope to see you all at Blanchet for Summer Festival. There will be a 5thÂ Friday Plus dance on July 29.
