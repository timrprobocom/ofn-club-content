### Announcing a new mural and community events project entitled Dancing for All to revitalize dancing at the Emerald Dance Center (EDC). 

The pandemic has affected all, and our local dance hall, EDC, in Springfield, Oregon, is no exception. The **Dancing for All** project can provide a key role in lifting up the human spirit. 

The **Dancing for All** mural will be placed on the EDC building in Fall of 2022. Mural artists R.E. Wall and Margaret Dewar of Mural Mice Universal will conduct a collaborative mural process that will ensure the mural stays in step with community identity.  The photo shows a mural by Mural Mice in Prescott, Arizona.

The **Dancing for All** mural will present the fun and healthy benefits of dancing as well as liven up the building. The project aims to draw the community to the dance hall and generate new interest in dancing. Color, vibrancy, and action in the mural will show the world that there is something for all inside.

**Dancing for All** events will coincide with the mural process and may include community dances (square, round, folk, ballroom), dance lessons, music events, and social gatherings to meet neighbors and make friends. 

Your help is appreciated! Donations will go towards: commissioning the artists, creating a collaborative design, purchasing materials, painting the mural, and scheduling special dances and events. Please give what you can and share this request with others. A GoFundMe site has been set up to receive donations.
