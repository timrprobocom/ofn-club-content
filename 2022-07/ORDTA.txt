We have not had a meeting since Mid-Winter and we will be meeting on July 16 at 9 am in the round dance hall at Summer Festival in Salem. Dues are due for some members and they can be mailed to Connie Clark or paid at the meeting. We will also hear from the featured cuer, Rikki Lobato, for some ideas on cueing, lessons, or other things she wishes to share with the membership.

Marilyn Schmit, Secretary
