We have not danced yet for the month of June, but our first dance has been moved to the Salem Square Dance Center because Polk County Fairgrounds has been rented out. Same for the first dance in July.

We had a board meeting in May and made a few decisions for future events and elections. A good meeting overall. 

We will have a celebration of life for Ralph Lambert on June 11 at 3:30 pm at Polk County Fairgrounds in the Arts and Crafts building.  Hope it is well attended to honor him.

Patty Hermann has retired and Molly Fairly has been hired as our new club caller. Her mom and dad, Debbie and Mike Combs, have trained her well. She is a good addition to our club.
