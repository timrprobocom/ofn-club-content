 Well, the hotter weather is suppose to be with us again this summer.  Even though we are at new digs at the Manor Grange, there is no air conditioning.  We have made the decision to go dark for our dances on the first and third Friday nights in July and August.
 We will continue to have round dance lessons on Sundays at 5 PM and Lessons from 6 to 8.  This is our way of testing out the conditions of the hall this year.  If the hall is too hot it is easier to contact our members than to let the whole world know we can not dance.  If you are interested in learning to round dance please let the club know.
