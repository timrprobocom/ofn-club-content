March 1, 1929 - June 9, 2022 

Bert Cathcart  passed away following an extended illness with Bev and family members at his side.

Bert was born in Corvallis OR to David and Maye Cathcart.  He and his 4 siblings were raised on a farm in Alsea OR.  He graduated from Oregon State College with a degree in electrical engineering and worked as a volunteer fireman for room and board.  He met Beverly Schure on a blind date and married her in 1951.  She remained the love of his life.
 
Bert was drafted into the army and served in the Army Signal Corp, traveling the country teaching the basic concepts of new radar systems.  He worked for Bonneville Power Administration for 31 years and was known for his expertise in troubleshooting power system failures, contributing to the creation of the power grid between Oregon and California in the 1970s.  Bert was a faithful member of Prince of Peace Lutheran church for nearly 50 years.  He sang in the choir, served as treasurer, and general maintenance man.  He spent his retirement years caring for grandchildren, square dancing, gardening, camping and traveling the country with Bev in their RV.  In later years he was a loving, devoted caregiver to Bev, his wife of 70 years. 
 
Bert was a gentle, kind, thoughtful, hard-working, fun-loving, musical, and intelligent individual with a curious mind that sought to solve problems, persevering to the very end.  His strength of character and love of family lives on in his children and grandchildren.

A memorial service will be held Friday July 8, 2022 at 11 am at Prince of Peace Lutheran Church, 14175 NW Cornell Road, Portland, OR 97229.  A light lunch will follow.  Please RSVP Deanne if attending the luncheon at deanne617@me.com.
