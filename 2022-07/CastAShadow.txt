We held two dances in May with one square of dancers each time.  Our fearless leader Fred as always chose some good basic advanced recordings for us to dance to as we all feel we are still brushing up and honing our skills after so many months of inactivity.  Please come join us if you are in the vicinity.  Door charge is $5.00 per person and we dance in Hall B of the Emerald Square Dance Center from 1:30 to 3:30PM at least two Sundays a month.  Please call fred before you come out to make sure we are dancing unless you have gotten the “go ahead”email from him during the week.   His number is 458-221-3564.  Our website is cas-sd.yolasite.com.

Hope you can join us on the dance floor soon,
Gaynor Hintz
