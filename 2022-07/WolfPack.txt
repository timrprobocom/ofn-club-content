In May, we were unable to hold most of our dances due to lack of participation.
We plan on dancing during the summer if we can get enough people for a square. We're taking 5 dancers through the SSD program, and we'll be having a dance on June 25th with our new dancers hopefully attending. We would love to have you join us and welcome our new dancers into this activity. We start with pre-rounds at 7 and then social square dancing  at 7:30.  Hope to see you there.
