After 46 years of dancing the Toe Draggers voted to fold.  At this writing, their last dance is scheduled to be on June 17th with  K.C. Curtis and Darrell Kalmbach calling and Tami Helms cueing. This is to be a free event with refreshments served.

The Toe Draggers had their beginnings from two square dance classes at the Rock Creek Campus of the Portland Community College in the mid 1970’s with Carl Decker as instructor.  The classes decided to form a club one night after a class while sitting in a restaurant, visiting.  They decided they needed a club name, club colors, club outfits and club badges with significant meaning to represent their group and future members of the club.

The "Toe Draggers" name was chosen because most of the group at that time thought they had "two left feet".  They decide on black and blue for club colors of outfits because of the bruises they had to endure while the "two left feet" dancers learned to square dance.  Each person could choose their own style of outfit to represent one’s own personality.  Club badges were selected in the shape and color of a bruised foot.  Thus, the club was as "one" in colors, but "different" in each outfit to represent the many personalities and talents of the club.

They needed four full squares of dancers to become members of the Portland Area Council of Square Dancers, but because of their size of just under two squares, they were accepted as associate members of the Council.  Their first home was at the Capital Hill Dance Club on SW 17th and Marigold in Portland in 1976.  They moved to the Kinton Grange Hall in 1980 and later became members of the Tualatin Valley Council.

The "Toes" will be missed....
