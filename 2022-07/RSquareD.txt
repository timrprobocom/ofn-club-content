R Square D finished lessons recently and welcomed six students into the club.  We will not hold classes again until September. 
 
Our Fiesta de Mayo Dance on May 13th was fun and we enjoyed taco soup at the break.  George Hermann filled in for Patty as our cuer and he was also seen onstage calling with Craig.  

Our summer schedule continues with “Crazy T-Shirt Dance” on July 13th and ice cream sundaes will be served at the break.  Craig Abercrombie is calling and Susan Healea will cue this dance.  Wear your favorite t-shirt!  July 27th is our “Hawaiian Dance” with Craig as our caller and Patty Hermann cueing rounds that night.  We will serve banana splits after the dance.

Our summer dances are casual and our hall is air conditioned, so join us for fun dancing!  Plus dancing and intermediate rounds from 7-8 PM and mainstream with phase II rounds from 8-9:30.  Hope to see you in a square!
