We look forward to our next Fifth Saturday Dance and invite you to join us.  That's July 30, 2022--not too long from now.  We have a cushioned wood floor and air conditioning so we will all be comfy and have a grand time!  We are at 2095 Yolanda in Springfield.  You can take Highway 126 to Mohawk Exit then turn north at the exit.  This becomes 19th and will be residential which confuses some.  Turn right on Yolanda and Voila!  The hall will be on your right!
