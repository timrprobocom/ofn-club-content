Sunset Promenaders and Promenaders Plus are still alive and well.  Our main stream dancers are dancing 1st and 3rd Saturdays at Odd Fellows Hall 7pm till 9:30 With Mike and Julie Stout doing the honors. Our Plus Dancers are dancing on the 1st and 3rd and 5th Thursday of the month, with Darrell & Erin and Tami & Tim doing the honors.  Dances start at 7pm and end 9:30. We are doing cookies at our Mainstream dances but nothing at our plus dance yet.

We have new officers in command; Judy Schnase is our President, Ed Mickelson is Vice President, Dianne Pratt is Secretary, and Lalani Radford is Treasurer.  I just want to thank those that have stepped up to help run this club, and Also want to thank Ferrous for keeping everyone informed on our clubs in the TVC.

I Hope everyone is doing well.
