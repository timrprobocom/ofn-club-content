SThe 2022 Summer Festival is just a couple weeks Away!!!! If you have not sent in your pre-registration…please do it soon. The festival committee has been working hard to make this a wonderful event but we need more dancers to make this event a success. Thank you to all the dancers who have already sent in your registration form.

Did you know there are two awards given to clubs at Summer Festival? They are the Chairman’s Trophy and Wood Award. The Chairman’s Trophy is given to the club with the highest percentage of its membership in attendance at Summer Festival. The Wood Award is presented to the club with the largest attendance at the Festival. The hosting area’s clubs are not eligible for these awards. As of this letter there are two clubs who appear to be in the lead. Get your club members together and send in your registrations soon! Don’t miss out on this fun filled event.

In addition to our featured caller, Pat Carnathan, and cuer, Rikki Lobato, are many callers and cuers from around the State and even California. See our website for a list of callers and cuers who are donating their time and talent for our favorite activity.

There will be mainstream, plus and advanced dancing as well as a round dance hall for your dancing pleasure July 15-17 at the Blanchett school in Salem.

Advanced Dancers: We Need You! The advanced hall will be open Friday evening and all-day Saturday but Sadly we only have 5 pre-registrants who mention dancing in the advanced hall. Please get your pre-registrations in so we can be sure to keep the callers, namely Craig Abercrombie, Pat Carnathan, Ian Craig, Randy Dibble, and Scott Zinser busy.

Several baskets and gift cards were donated for the silent auction. There are 4 wood flags available for raffle, see them in the dance halls and be sure to buy your tickets. There will be 50/50 available on Friday and Saturday for some lucky winner(s) to take home some cash.

Due to the high cost we will not publish a program book. However, the schedule will be posted at each hall and the daily schedule will be available at the registration desk in the front lobby.

See You in July!

Cece & Lorri
