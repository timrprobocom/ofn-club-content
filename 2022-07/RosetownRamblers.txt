The Ramblers closed out our 2021-22 dance season with our annual Pride dance at the Oak Grove Community Center on June 12. Rainbows and lollipops were seen in profusion--but, alas, no sunshine. Still, Don Wood's calling brightened up the dance hall, as three squares tapped their toes and twirled their belles and beaus. Don's been calling our Pride dance for something like 20 years now, and we really appreciate his support for our club.

We'll be dark in July and August and look forward to having our monthly dances resume on September 10. Keep your eyes peeled for information on callers and dance format. Hopefully, we will be back to a closer semblance of normal by then.

As you plan your club's fall visitations, keep in mind our snazzy new club banners that Keith Miles designed and produced for us. You'll definitely want to see if you can earn one of these for your trophy case.

We'd like to thank all the Portland area clubs and dancers who supported us during this tricky COVID period by attending our dances. We especially want to call out Happy Hoppers, Country Cut-ups, Tri-Squares, Oaky Doaks, and Chaps and Petticoats. We also want to acknowledge the hard work that PAC President Robert Lumsden has done to promote visitations and mutual support for our clubs. It's a tough time for our favorite pastime, but whining won't pay the bills! Let's dance!

SYIAS!
