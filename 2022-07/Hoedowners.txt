Here we are in May, thank goodness!  Are you still wearing long sleeves?  I am.  It’s the kind of spring where its best to keep moving to keep the cool, damp weather at bay.  Now this got me to thinking about that timeless children’s game, Mother May I?  Does anyone ask if they “may” do something anymore?  In grade school Mr. Simpson would not respond if you asked, "can I go to the library?”.  He would say, “I don’t know, can you?”  It took a couple of weeks for the class to figure out we were supposed to say, “May I go to the library?”  Turns out “may” is asking for permission while “can” is having the ability to do something.  It was a hard-won lesson in grammar that only a few still observe.  I think the children’s game Mother May I was an attempt to teach kids to ask permission using the correct grammar.
 
May I tell you about the Hoedowners’ dances this past month?  On May 14th Dan Nordbye and Randy Lewis were calling the shots or should I say steps?  I can feel the dancers settling in and dancing like we used to.  May 28th was our second dance of the month and on Memorial Day weekend. 

There were plenty of dancers in town and our attendance numbers continue to climb.  Thank Goodness!  Who was sending us around the dance floor?  Darrell Kalmbach was the caller and Randy Lewis was our cuer.  Aren’t we lucky?

The round lessons are on break but will resume Tuesday, July 5th when we’ll be refreshing basic waltz, cha-cha, rumba (the rhythm, not the vacuum) and two step.  Come and join us for a brush up.

Please join us for our regularly scheduled dances in July.  On the 11th Scott Zinser will be calling with Connie Clark cueing and on June 23rd we’ll welcome K. C. Curtis and Randy Lewis.
