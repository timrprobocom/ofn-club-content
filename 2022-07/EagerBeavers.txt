 We were delighted to have 18 guests attend our Memorial Day Dance featuring Jim Hattrick as our caller and cuer.  We learned a couple of new moves as we danced around our squares in red, white and blue.
 We will wear those colors again for our dance on the 4th of July.  Jim will call and cue for that dance as well as on July 18th, and our team of Darrell Kalmbach calling and Jeanine Norden cueing will lead us on July 11th and 25th.
 Eager Beavers dance Plus and Rounds every Monday afternoon from 1:00 to 3:00.  Most of our dancers are vaccinated.  Currently we are not requiring proof of vaccination and masks are optional.  Aloha Grange has AC.  For current information, please see our website at http://EagerBeavers.info.
