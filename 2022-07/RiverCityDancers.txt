On June 11, River City Dancers celebrated 32 years of dancing and look forward to many more.

Beginning June 25, our dance schedule will be changed to second and fourth Saturday each month. Please see our flyers for dance details.  We dance all summer and hope that you will come join us. Our hall is air conditioned for your summer comfort.

Our club will have a clothing resale shop at summer festival this year. Please come check it out for great bargains July 15 and 16 in Salem. 

Happy dancing,
Carol Mendenhall
