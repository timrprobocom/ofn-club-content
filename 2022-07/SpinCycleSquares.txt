We are back to dancing!  We dance every Sunday from 4 - 6.  Tim is a great caller and will call whatever level we can muster.  We've had a few fairly new dancers who are having a great time.  We have hand sanitizers on the tables and please bring your own water.  We invite you all to join us!  We're a fun bunch and have been gathering during the pandemic being masked and socially distanced just to visit and see each others' faces!  Now, masks are optional at our dances.

Please call our president, David, at  541-520-7311 to make sure we are, indeed, dancing.  Once in a blue moon we are dark.
