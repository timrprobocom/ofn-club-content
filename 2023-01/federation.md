Welcome to January, the first month of 2023. We as a committee are all excited and preparing for your arrival to our festival in just a few short weeks.  If you happen to read this before the 31st of December, please make your hotel reservation.  Square dancer discounts at the hotels stop on the 1st of January so make sure you have your room. Another important date is the 8th. It's the last day to get the preregistration price tag, so save yourself some money and get those registrations in.

Now that we got all the important announcements out of the way let me introduce you to our two fabulous cuers that round out our amazing entertainment panel for you.  First we have our round dance cuers, Deb and Tim Vogt from Las Vegas NV.  They have been cuing for over 37 years.  They delight the round dancers with lots of amazing dances from easy 2 all the way up to level 5/6.  They primarily cue here in the west but are well traveled and if you get a chance to watch them at the showcase, they dance together amazingly!  Next we have our clogging cuer Shane Gruber from Detroit, MI. Shane has been keeping cloggers on their toes for over 30 years.  He has cued and performed across the entire world. He is truly a sight to behold and if you get a chance you should head over to the Comfort Suites hotel and watch him dance and teach. 

We hope that you can come join us at what is shaping up to be a magical and enchanting festival. See you all in a square soon.
