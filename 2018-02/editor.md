I want to make you all aware of a scam that is being aimed at our square dance clubs. The scammer sends an email message to the club treasurer, claiming to be from the club president, saying something like "please send a check for $XXXX to our vendor at such-and-such an address." The problem is, even though the message has the president's name, it's not the president's email address, and it's easy to miss that. One TVC club lost nearly their entire treasury to this scam.

We must be vigilent. If you get a check request like this, double check that the email address is the correct one. Until this thread passes, clubs might consider limiting check requests by email, or requiring validation by phone, or maybe by having a special code word that must be present in all check requests.

Starting this month, you can find a return of the "Caller's Corner" that used to appear in the printed OFN. Janienne Alexander has agreed to take on the position of Caller Liaison to the Federation. As part of that position, she'll be sharing with us tidbits of helpful information from the caller's point of view.
