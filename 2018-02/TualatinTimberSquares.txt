Tualatin Timber Squares is having a fabulous time at lessons!  The first Wednesday of each month is a No Experience Necessary Square Dance with a LIVE band!  To start the music the floor yells “Fire in the Hole!”  What a difference a LIVE band makes in the energy level on the floor!  I don’t know who had more fun,  dancers listening to the band or the band watching the dancers glide across the floor.  I highly recommend it.
 Callers – CALLERLAB this year will be featuring a class on Sunday before the convention on how to call with a live band.  Come join me!  You can register at: http://www.callerlab.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=GNrzzxk6dRs%3d&portalid=1
 The weeks in between our LIVE band sessions, we will have progressive lessons dancing to pre-recorded music.
 Clubs – Consider having a field trip with your students to one of our band nights.  Let us know ahead of time and we’ll put an extra crockpot on for you!
