The Promenaders have started an ambitious lesson schedule each Sunday;  Basic Two-Step lessons from 2 to 4 with Ken Pratt instructing, Mainstream Square Dance from 4 to 6 with Mike Stout instructing, and Intermediate Round Dance from 6:30 to 8 with Ken instructing.  That is a busy schedule!
 The Club has started our Mainstream lessons and are hoping for a great class like the one we had last year.  Last year we graduated 10 new dancers and all of them are enjoying the club and dancing with us.  Some of them are already working as club officers, etc.  It is encouraging to watch how they are volunteering their time and helping with the club work.   
 The Sunset Promenaders hosted the Annual TVC New Year’s Eve dance and it was a fun dance for 90 dancers with national caller Dan Nordbye calling and Julie Stiers cueing.  Dan announced at the dance that he is moving to Oregon in April to live.
 Darrell Kalmbach, our Thursday night Plus Dance caller is now the club caller for the River City Dancers too.  They dance at Milwaukie Community Center on the 2nd and 3rd Saturdays.  
 Our February dance calendar is:
 • February 1st our Thursday evening Plus Dance 7:00 to 9:30 with Darrell and Ken calling and cueing.
 • February 3rd our Saturday evening Mainstream Dance 7:00 to 9:30 with Mike Stout and Ken Pratt calling and cueing.  The dance theme is Mardi Gras so expect a wild and fun time.
 • February 15th, Thursday Plus Dance, with Darrell and Ken.
 • February 17th, Saturday Mainstream Dance, with Mike and Ken the theme is Valentine Dance so bring your sweetheart and enjoy.
