In January Tri Squares began the second ten weeks of Mainstream lessons, B52-B68, with a B51 Dance scheduled for January 13th.
 Everyone is invited to come to our anchor dance, The Mardi Gras Masquerade Ball, on Saturday, February 10th.  This year we will have a number of very special items to raffle off.  Examples?  Your one-dollar ticket might get you a $100 gift certificate to Les Schwab at Washington Square, or a $160 wine tasting tour at Willamette Valley Vineyards for you and seven of your friends!  Put on your mask and boa feathers and come dance with us!
