The Rogue Squares still have 3 students every week. Phil is very pleased with their progress. We were dark over the holidays, but these kids are right back in the groove and doing great.

The Rogue Squares "Pajamarama" was a great SUCCess. There were "new" students all the way from Roseburg to Yreka. This was our annual "Pajamarama" and we will most likely make it an "annual" dance for beginners. All clubs were invited to bring their class to this dance. The new student dancers didn't have to worry about having "square dance" attire, they just wore their "jammies". Phil Ramey was in his "glory" doing what he does best â€” working with new dancers.

We are really excited about the line-up of callers for the club dances for February and March. We will be dark in April for Pear Blossom.

See you in a square!
