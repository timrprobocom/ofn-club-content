It looks like very soon, our construction manager, Henry Hammer, will begin the makeover of the ladies bathroom.  In the meantime, we will only have one bathroom, which will be unisex.  Everyone will need to hurry through there.  (No time for primping, ladies; besides, weâ€™re beautiful enough.)  Bathroom monitor Fanny Frump will keep things in order.
