The Umpqua Council is gearing up for our annual January New Dancer Dance. If you, or your students, need some last minute practice before Mid-Winter, then come join us! The dance is on January 21st and begins with pre-rounds at 1:45 and squares at 2:00. We will dance to Chuck Simpkins and any jamboree callers who wish to call. 

The Umpqua Council sponsors four nights of dancing at the Douglas County Fair each year, and all proceeds from this dance help to pay for the callers and cuers. Admission to the dance will be $5 per dancer.
