Our Waltz class is winding down and we are doing mostly dances to keep our memories full of what we have learned the past several months. Every now and then we work on a step that gives us fits.

We had a board meeting in November and discussed our schedule and may make a change with the start of a new rhythm in March. Possibly jive followed by slow two-step for the summer. Plus we may change our lesson time to 6:30, dance phase 3-4 at 7:30, and dance phase 4+ and easy 5 at 8:30. Will see how the winter makes it through January. Stay tuned for the possible changes.

A lot of our members will be at Mid-Winter dancing with the guest cuer, TJ Chadd and her husband, Bruce. We look forward to finding out what they plan to share with the dancers.
	
We hosted a New Yearâ€™s Eve dance and had several dancers there to enjoy the evening of fun and friendship. See pictures elsewhere in this issue of who came to visit the dance. We hope that 2018 will be a good year for all concerned. Keep dancing and come see us. We enjoy company. Marilyn Schmit
