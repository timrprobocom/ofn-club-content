On December 19th the Dancing Friends celebrated their 28th Birthday. They had a combined Christmas Round Dance Party with the Buckeroos. Neil Koozer kept everyone dancing with a delightful variety of rhythms and lots of Christmas music. 

The Dancing Friends had only been having one dance a year, and that was enough to maintain club status. A few years back, they started weekly lessons and invited the Buckeroos. This has been advantageous for both groups. The Dancing Friends are once again an active and growing club!
