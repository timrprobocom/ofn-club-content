Three clubs made visitations to our October Birthday Dance, so, at the end of December, more than half of our club members made a return visitation to the River City Dancers to retrieve our banner.  We were welcomed by the RCD and shown a delightful evening, complete with a very clever gift exchange.  It was a special treat for us to get another fun night of dancing with our caller, and THEIRS, Randy Dibble!  We look forward to visiting 2 more clubs to retrieve our other banners.
 Two days later icy sidewalks and roads canceled a lot of activities, so here again is the reminder:  check our website whenever you have doubts as to whether the dance is on or the weather has compelled a cancellation.
