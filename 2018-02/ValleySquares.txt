Please join us for our Souper Bowl Dance called by Scott Zinser & Connie Clark February 3rd. Yummy soups will be served prior to the dance at the Aloha Grange. 
 We hosted the Grangeâ€™s 150th anniversary celebration at our first dance in December.  Called by Craig Abercrombie, it was also the trophy dance.  Carolene awarded the prize to Hoedowners. 
 Our Christmas Dance featured Connie cueing and Mark Wheeler calling. 
 Ugly sweaters were donned for our visitation to Tualatin Timber Squares party.
