The Toe Draggers are enjoying 2018.  We took one last activity together in the grange for 2017.  KC and Linda thanked the club by sponsoring a game night with wonderful snacks.  We played table games with lots of loud laughter, ate delicious foods and left with wonderful memories.  We do have fun together.
 Our Black and Blue Ball was a memorable one with our new students attending.  They are a fun bunch.  January 19th is our regular dance but knowing our club nothing is just regular, thanks to KC and Bev.
 January 7th Bev and Harlan Flint began Round Dance lessons.  They are being held at the Kinton Grange on Sundays from 2 to 4 p.m.  Come join in on the fun.
 We hope to see you at Mid Winter Festival down in Albany.
 Our February dances include two special ones.  February 2nd is our Ground Hog Dance and February 16th is our Sweetheart Ball.  Come join us for both.  We love visitors.
