<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, Janienne Alexander here, Caller Liaison for the Oregon Federation of Square and Round Dance Clubs. I am an active member in the caller associations in Washington and Oregon as well as CALLERLAB, International Association of Square Dance Callers.&nbsp; I have been asked to share with our councils, clubs, dancers the different topics that are being discussed amongst the callers. When we all work together it makes for an enjoyable lasting activity that we can use to build up our communities and pass on to younger generations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The following is a condensed article from Steve Noseck, Washington Caller. <em>My comments are in italics.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Top Tips for Dancing Longer into the Night</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">#1 "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" The Beatles weren't even Square Dancers and they knew about #1. This is the #1 reason squares break. <em>Every chance you get gently hold your partners hand.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">#2 "It's A Small Small World" Disney got this, that smaller not bigger is much better, keep your square/wave/lines/partner near you. Less steps Less work, more dance.&nbsp; <em>I see lines where you can fit another square in between them! That means I have to take 4 - 5 steps before I can star thru. What if I only had to take one? Could I keep up with the music timing if I keep my square smaller?&nbsp; Yes!</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">#3 "One Step Forward Two Steps Back" by Desert Rose Band, great song but, No,No,No,No - move forward first (some exceptions). <em>When in doubt, put both hands up and move forward. Someone will gently catch you. </em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">#4 "I Walk the Line" Johnny Cash got it. When your square goes down, go to a line, as quick as gentle and as quiet as you can. You cannot catch up to the missed calls BUT you can lower the number of calls you miss.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">#5 "I will be Right here waiting for You" by Richard Marx. This activity is dominated by your "right" hand. When in doubt use your right hand first. If I, or other Callers want you to use your left we usually call "Left", like Left swing thru or Left Square thru. Again some minor exceptions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Next month, I'll chat about the use of a "singles board".</p>
