â€‹Well every one is planning how to budget their time around all the dancing..

Mid-Winter is behind us and our Birthday Dance is February 24th with Lawrence Johnstone and Rikki Lobato.   Come spend the evening with us and enjoy some great calling and cuing.

April brings Pear Blossom and May brings Boatnik and June brings Mid-Summer right here in Grants Pass and of course July brings Diamond Lake with HUNTER KELLER   More as the year goes on.

I know there are other festivals and weekends here and lots of other places.....look them up!!!!!!!!

They will be listed here and in RoguevSquares Newsletter and lots of other square dance sites.  Look around and go places or stay home and dance.  There are many wonderful callers and cuers to entertain our dancing feet.

We are going to plan some potlucks this Spring sponsored by our January class.......no dates have been set so keep you ears open....

Mexican Train Potluck Nite has been such fun.   We have done it twice so far and probably again this month too.  But as I write no date has yet been set....contact me or Roberta for the date...

So come on out to our classes and our dances.  Bring a friend.  If you are not dancing right now come and visit.....

Ladies to the center..............
