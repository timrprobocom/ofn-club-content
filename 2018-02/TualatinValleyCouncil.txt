The annual TVC New Years Eve Dance had 11 enthusiastic squares dancing at one point.  Dan Nordbye called a spirited dance with Julie Stiers cuing our favorites.  Dancers enjoyed a fruit and desert bar between tips.  We began dancing at 9PM, ushered in the New Year, and wrapped up at 12:15.  The club with the highest percentage of their members present was the Sunset Promenaders and were rewarded with the TVC Banner.
 Our annual TVC Presidents Meeting & Potluck for current and past club Presidents will be held at the IOOF Hall, 267 East Main Street, Hillsboro, OR 97123 on January 22nd with the potluck dinner starting at 6:00 and meeting at 7:00.

Also, at this meeting the TVC President, Dale Brabham, will announce the recipient of the Tualatin Valley Council “Recognition Award” for outstanding service and special contribution to the square dance community within the TVC geographical area.
