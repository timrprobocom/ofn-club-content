Thank you to everyone who joined us for our New Dancers/Baked Potato Dinner Dance. We all had a great time dancing and a good dinner.
Our youth are starting practices Tuesday evenings at the Waldo Hills Community Center, Silverton 7:00 -9:00 pm and Sundays at Maplewood Grange, Aurora 6:00-8:00 pm. If you are a youth ages 8-19 and are interested in joining us in competing this year, contact Karyn Buchheit at 503-873-5241 or buchheitfarmkm@gmail.com for more information. You need to be able to dance at least mainstream level. There is more than one level in competition and Karyn will assign you to a square team according to your level of dance experience.
Our youth fundraiser dance will be Sunday March 4. Please watch for the flyer and come support us. We will also have a silent auction/basket raffle as well as drawing the winners for our cash raffle. Catch one of us at a dance to purchase a raffle ticket.
We still have Teen Festival pins for sale - catch us at a dance. These are both a fundraiser for us as well as your ticket into the Teen Festival so that you can watch! See you at a dance soon. Petrina Buchheit
