Hi Everyone,

Progress is being made for the upcoming "Fifth" Friday dance in March. More information to follow as it is received.

There is also progress on this June's Summer Festival. More information to come later.

We are still asking people to come out and support the new classes. We had a couple new classes start in the Rogue Valley in January and "Angels" would be very helpful.

PLEASE support the Council and the Clubs in the Rogue Valley. Everyone needs all the support they can get. Times are "skinny", so, please come out and help by supporting your local clubs.

The next Council meeting will be February 6, 2018 at Denny's Restaurant on Biddle Road at 4:30pm.

There are still "Learn to Square Dance" t-shirts available. I have quite a few 2X's. We have found the t-shirts are a great conversation starter.
