As I am writing this members of the Oaky Doaks are preparing for the Mid-Winter Festival in Albany in a couple weeks as well as our New Dancer Jamboree in a couple days. The new year of dancing has begun.

For February, the Oaky Doaks will be starting the month off with Round Dance lessons beginning on Thursday, February 1st, from 7:00 to 9:00 pm at the Oak Grove Community Center. Connie Clark will be teaching Cha Cha and Rhumba. Please call: 503-310-5672 if you have any questions about the class. 

On Saturday, February 3rd, the Oaky Doaks will be celebrating Valentine’s Day a little early with our “Choc-a-lot Valentine” dance. Caller will be Janienne Alexander with Cuer Molly Combs. Pre-Rounds are at 7:00 pm, Mainstream with Rounds are from 7:30 to 9:30 pm and Break is at 9:30 pm. So, will you be our Valentine and join us at the dance?

February 17th, the third Saturday of the month, we will be dancing to Caller Mark Wheeler and Cuer Julie Stiers.  Pre-Rounds are at 7:00 pm, Mainstream with Rounds is from 7:30 to 9:30 pm and Break is at 9:30 pm.

If we don’t see you in Albany for Mid-Winter we hope to see you at one of our events in February.
