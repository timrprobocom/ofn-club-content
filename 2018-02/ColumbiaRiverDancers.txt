Looking forward to having a club visit us on February 10th.  It is always fun to have other clubs join for a dance.  Craig Abercrombie will be calling and cueing for our Valentine's Dance so plan on wearing red.  On the 24th, Jim Hattrick will be our featured caller/cuer.
 December was cold and Christmas was close at hand so the turnout was low although the dancing was fast and hot.  Those of use that did dance had a great time with the Stouts calling and cueing on the 9th and Jim on the 23rd.  Thanks to the Grange the hall was nicely decorated for the Christmas season.
 Lessons are still being started the first Tuesday of each month under Jim's leadership, so if you have friends you would like to learn send them of the grange.  Beginners are from 7 to 8:30 and mainstream following.
 Looking forward to seeing many of you in Albany.
