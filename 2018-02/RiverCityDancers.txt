December was a very busy month for us.  We had our club holiday dinner and party earlier in the month, and also hosted a new dancers dance with an experienced clothing sale. It was a big success with 10 squares. Our clothing sale also went very well.  Our last two club dances had quest callers.  We finished the year with a wonderful NewYears Eve dinner dance. Darrell Kalmbach called and Tami Helms cued. The theme was black and white. It was a fun dance with 8 squares and a catered chicken dinner.  What a great way to begin the New Year. Our lessons continue with Craig Abercrombie teaching, and our students will be graduated by Mid-Winter.

 We enter our new year with enthusiasm and excitement as we warmly welcome our new club caller Darrell Kalmbach and his wife Erin to our River City Dancers family. Darrell will be calling each of our club dances from now on . Please come dance with us any second and third Saturday at our hall at Milwaukie Community Center and help us welcome Darrell and Erin.

Darrell will be away on Saturday March 10 for only that one dance and Ian Craig will be our guest caller for that dance. Darrell will be calling all our other dances, so come enjoy.
