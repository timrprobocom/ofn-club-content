Cherry City Cloggers are starting the New Year enthusiastically with many things to look forward to, like clogging at Mid-Winter with the National Cuers Russ and Leila Hunsaker.  

Just had our election of officers and Mary Ellen Ramseyer remains our president for
another year. Jan Fiedler will remain our Vice President. Pam Owens will be our new Secretary and Georganne Pfnister remains our area representative. We will be having our semi-annual meeting on Saturday, February 3 at 10:30 to discuss the upcoming demo season and the choice of songs for it. We will also be discussing demo outfits and other things for the good of the order.

We still have not been able to locate a permanent instructor for the club, so Glee Johnson has taken over the 4 o'clock class, Grace Allen still works with the beginners and Stacey Larson and Moya McKeehan share the intermediate class. It looks as though we will not be starting another beginner class in February as we did last year, but we are looking forward to the steady attendance we have been having. Georganne Pfnister
