Welcome to the shortest month of the year.  That means spring flowers are that much closer.   This is the month for hearts and flowers and boxes of chocolates.  We celebrate Valentine’s Day at our dance on the 12th with the crowning of King and Queen of Hearts.  Marie Clem is the chair this year having been crowned Queen last year. Wear something with hearts and flowers or just a cheery smile.  I am sure Darrell will have sweet calls and music for us. 
 After a very successful Plus Class last year we are repeating our program starting at Monday noon, February 5th, running through May.  If you are thinking about learning or brushing up on Plus come join us.  We will have the same three great callers giving the lessons: Daryl Clendenin, Jim Hattrick, and Darrell Kalmbach.  Call Sally (503-645-2414) or Karen (503-649-9487) to sign up and learn more.
 Celebrate Presidents’ Day on the 19th by coming to visit the Eager Beavers.  We will be dancing with our Plus class starting at noon then continuing with our usual dance at 1:15 to 3:00 pm.
 TVC’s New Year Dance at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro was co-hosted by the Sunset Promenaders assisted by a bunch of dedicated volunteers.  Thanks to all those who made the dance a success.  The 2018 TVC New Year Dance will be co-hosted by Eager Beavers and Sunset Promenaders.
