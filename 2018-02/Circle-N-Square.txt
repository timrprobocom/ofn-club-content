Thank you Dean for a fun dance for our newer dancers and the plus dancers. 

A few of our members are sick and some are healing. Our thoughts are for those people.

Classes are plugging away and some of our newer dancers have gone up to Medford for dancing.  Happy to see them going up there as well. 

Our next dance is February 17, our Valentine Dance with rounds at 7 and squares at 8.   There will be a board meeting at 5:45pm.

See you on the dance floor.
