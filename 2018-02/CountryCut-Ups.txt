2018 started with a fun dance to Craig Abercrombie calling and cueing. February will see us graduating our Mainstream students before the end of the month. We hope they keep on dancing throughout the year! We are discussing some mainstream workshops in March and the possibility of a Plus level class this spring, if there is enough interest, so keep your ears open for announcements.

March will bring another Murder Mystery Dance. The Crazy 8 Players are at it again! This time, we will be performing an original play by our Cut-Ups Presidents and rumor has it that it is a funny show! They have leaked the name of the play, “Who Blew Up the Outhouse?” and it is set in the Old Wild West.  This year there will also be a dinner following. The Country Cut-Ups are planning to build an outdoor dance floor to help beat the summer heat and the Murder Mystery will be a fundraiser for this. Buy your tickets in advance for $15 for the play, dance, and dinner. If you procrastinate, you can pay $18 at the door. Scott Zinser will be calling and you all will be voting to see is you can figure out whodunnit!  You don’t want to miss this event! 

We are accepting donations for the Annual Barn Sale which helps to fund upkeep on our old Boring Barn. This structure will celebrate its 100th birthday in 2019! Come out and enjoy the historic ambience on the 1st, 4th, or 5th Saturdays.
