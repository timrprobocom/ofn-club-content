It's celebration time! The Lebanon Square Circlers will have its 69th BIRTHDAY DANCE on Sunday, January 21st from 2:00 - 5:00 PM. Charlotte Jeskey, regular club caller, and Jim Voll - who called for the club for 25 years -  will be calling. Jackie Gale will be cueing. Every third tip will be plus. Of course, we will be serving strawberry shortcake at the break. It promises to be a glorious dance, so we hope that a lot of dancers will be there to help us enjoy it. Then the following week our club will be participating in the Mid Winter festivities. It will be great to see you all there.  
   
In February and March we will be dancing on the first and third Saturday nights with a Hippie dance and the "Girls Night Out" calling on March 17. See you in a square! Marilyn York
