On December 31st club members and guests had a great time at the Hoppers’ New Year’s Eve dance as we “Sailed Away” from 2017 and into 2018.  Now we’re looking forward to some special up-coming events such as the Oregon Mid-Winter festival and our own plans for February. If you attend Mid-Winter, you are sure to see many of our members kicking up their heels dancing to the terrific callers and cuers who make that festival so much fun.  Whether or not you attend Mid-Winter and see us there, we hope we will see you at one of our February dances.  

Both dances in February are part of a special month for our Hopper members, for we are more than just a square dance club.  Throughout the year our members contribute both time and material goods to our community.  For example, not only do we sort food for a local food bank, FISH, several times during the year, but February is our annual food drive for another food bank, the North Clark County Food Bank.  During both dances in February we collect canned goods which are delivered to the food bank at the end of the month.  We’re hoping to make this year a “banner year” and surpass the number of pounds of food we have collected in the past.
