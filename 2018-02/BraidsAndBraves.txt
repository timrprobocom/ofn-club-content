Another year is gone and a new one starts. Think of all the fun we had dancing and the new friends we made this past year. Square Dancing can deter Alzheimer's and keeps us physically healthy as well as providing great friendships and good times together. I suggest a New Year's resolution to dance more, to enjoy life more. Blessings and a Happy New Year. Carmen
