Belated happy New Years from the Bee's ! I missed the deadline for the last 2 months thanks to family health issues but everybody is back up and running.

Here is a recap of some fun dances we had these past two months. The black light dance in November was a blast and well-attended. If you ever have a chance to attend one, I highly encourage it. We had a dance in December that we call the "Senior Appreciation" dance where we take in donations from club members of toiletries, crossword books, jigsaw puzzles, lap blankets, Etc. We had a fabulous turnout of donations which we then donated to Woodland Assisted Living and Arbor Ridge Assisted Living. These are two senior facilities that have mostly low-income residents. The activity directors are so appreciative of the donations - every resident gets something.

We will have our annual pie eating contest on February 3rd. We will be dark on February 17th because there is a clogging event in our Hall that weekend so we plan a visitation on the Friday of that week. Our Silver Anniversary dance will be Saturday, April 21st.

Our beginner class is doing well and will graduate on Sunday 1 / 14 / 18 at 6 pm.

Our club welcomes Dorothy Lowder back as cuer for our dances on the first Saturday of the month. It is great to see Dorothy and Hoyt again.

The Bees were proud to see Carol Zelmer receive the Bob Kendall Award from the Evergreen Council.

In December we started doing every third tip as a plus tip. We have been doing plus lessons on Sundays. The plus class is not yet ready to graduate as our beginner class is, so the lessons will continue. We welcome all plus dancers to be angels at lessons  and to the club dance.
