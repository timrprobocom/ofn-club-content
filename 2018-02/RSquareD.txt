On December 8th R Square D hosted a Toy Dance with over $300 worth of toys gathered and given to the Salvation Army for distribution to children in need.  On December 9th 10 club members went to Columbia River Dancers and returned home with a traveling banner.
 R Square D had a Christmas party on December 18th.  We started with a pot luck, a short business meeting and a gift exchange.  It is always fun to see what items are in demand as we are allowed to steal each gift two times.  Home made items are always a hit.
 R Square D was dark on December 23rd so that club members could enjoy Christmas with family members.  It is beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  The snow is falling as I write this report.  A white Christmas would be nice, as long as I can stay inside and watch.
