<p class="MsoNormal">February, a month that is known for love, appreciation, and gratitude, is the perfect month to talk about our square and round dance volunteers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Without our volunteers, this activity we all love could never take place, since each dance or event is organized by at least one volunteer. During the 27 years that Tim and I have been square dancing, we have had the privilege of volunteering with many great groups of people from the club level all the way up to the National Level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Two things all of these wonderful people have in common is a love of square dancing and a desire to put on the best dance or event you have ever attended. Before I write one more sentence, I want to say thank you to each and every one of our volunteers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You are appreciated more than words can express.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Between January and March, most of our clubs, councils, and the state will be looking for volunteers to hold office for the next year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some of the positions are in leadership while some are in support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Please consider where you can help, and say &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; if someone talks to you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Even if you just want to dance, there is a perfect position for you that does not take any time away from your dancing but will be a huge help.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you are shy about volunteering to be an officer, another way to volunteer is to help put on a festival or special dance event.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You don&rsquo;t have to be the chairman or a member of the board - you could be the cookie baker who makes the cookies that the callers and cuers enjoy during their breaks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The point is we need volunteers at all levels to keep our activity strong.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you are debating whether you should volunteer or whether you have anything to contribute, the answer is a resounding YES.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We need you, want you, and appreciate you whether you are volunteering for 5 minutes or for a year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Those of us who are perpetual volunteers need to encourage, accept and mentor our new volunteers who are brave enough to step forward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Volunteers &ndash; Thank you!</p>
