By the time this comes out, Mid-Winter Festival will almost be behind us. We hope all will have an enjoyable time there!

February is very special for our club as it is the month of our Birthday Dance, on February 24! We'll be dark on February 10 for the Sweet Home Birthday Dance. 

Thanks to all who have hosted the New Dancers' dances; they've been a lot of fun! We're looking forward to our coast trip March 9-10 at Gleneden Beach Community Club, and all are welcome! We're dancing there both Friday and Saturday nights. Karen
