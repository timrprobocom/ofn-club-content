Happy New Year from all of us here at the Buckeroo Barn! We hope this year is filled with happiness and good health for all!

We are about 2/3 of the way through our fall session of mainstream lessons. The students are doing great and looking forward to our New Dancer Dance this month. They are also looking forward to joining us at Mid-Winter and catching up with our friends from all over Oregon. There are 11 students who have already decided to become Buckeroos! We are looking forward to welcoming them to our club and having them join as angels when we begin our new session of mainstream lessons on February 2, 2018.

Our special fifth Saturday dance on December 30th was a huge success! Scott Zinser came down from Portland and called the squares. We had a chance to dance both mainstream and plus. Instead of having rounds between tips we had line dances. The DC Line Dancing Group joined us for the evening. They got us out on the floor for a few line dances, and Scott got them out on the floor for a tip. We had a ton of fun and hope to do some joint dances in the future.

We rang in the New Year on December 31st with Chuck Simpkins and Neil Koozer. Everyone, including our new dancers, enjoyed a festive celebration.  Spending time with people you enjoy and dancing in the New Year is one of the best ways to spend New Year’s Eve!

During our dance on January 6th we had our first Chili Competition. The competition was fun and delicious with many yummy entries. Club member Lynnette Gibson won the top award for 2018! We hope to see many more entries next year, and for those who would rather be judges you are welcome as well.

Remember… we are just a short drive south from the Portland area, so plan to join us in the near future. We dance the first and third Saturdays and always enjoy having visitors. We have members of all ages and are a family friendly club.


Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
