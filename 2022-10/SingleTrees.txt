We continue to dance on the fourth Friday of every month unless it falls on a holiday weekend or there is a festival taking place nearby.  Jim Hattrick is our caller and Jackie Gale is our cuer.  We enjoy dancing to their calls and cues and invite everyone to come dance with us and enjoy them too.

We dance at the Emerald square Dance Center in Hall A from 7:30 to 10PM.  We start with a plus tip, then 15 minutes of rounds and then mainstream with every 3rd tip plus until 10.

As many of you know, Jim Hattrick took a bad fall and broke his hip.  He hopes to be calling soon, but there is the possibility we will need to have a substitute for our dance on September 23.  Please check  our website for more information as the time draws closer (I am assuming the Oct. OFN will have been published before then).  We wish him a speedy recovery.

Hope to see you in a square soon,
