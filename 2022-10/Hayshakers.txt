The Hayshakers continue dancing every Sunday in the Pacific Grange on highway 101 in Warrenton from 5 until 7 p.m.  We are starting a new series of lessons in October with new students accepted on the 2nd and 9th. Weâ€™ll dance Mainstream on Sunday October 23rd immediately following the Seaside Sashay which takes place on Friday and Saturday the 21st & 22nd in the Seaside Convention Center. The pandemic is long over, so come out and dance.
