Willamette Squares had a nice visitation from Salem Swingin’ Stars. We are looking forward to our Oktoberfest dance for the month of September. In October, our birthday dance will take place Sunday afternoon October 23. That means we will be dark for our regular dance night, Saturday, October 22. We will also be dark in December due to a conflict with Christmas Eve and in January due to a conflict with Mid-Winter. That means our regular dance in November will be our final dance for the year! 

Bruce and Judy are still cruisin’ and our club president, John, will be in Ireland for the rest of the month. Come join us for Oktoberfesting and get your fill of Octoberfest sausage. Hoping to see you in a square!
