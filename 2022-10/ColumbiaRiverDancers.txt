Along with just being dark for the month came the bad news that our caller, Jim Hattrick, fell at home and broke his hip.  As I write this he is still in the hospital.  His fall comes on top of surgery that he had on his hand.  Needless to say we are in a state of uncertainty.  We have contacted a number of callers, many of which have commitments already.  

I encourage everyone to say a prayer for his recovery.  In the meantime, folks can go to our website columbiariverdancers.com to get the latest information on our dances and on updates about Jim. 

Jim has had a few health problems in the past and has come through in flying colors.  The club is sure with our prayers it will be the same this time.
