This may seem like a broken record but not very much has changed over the past month.  We were hoping to see some valley dancers trying to escape the heat but I guess they all have air conditioning. At least we have not had to cancel a dance due to low attendance but we mostly only have one square.  Our caller/cuer is Lane Clem.  Our dances are held weekly on Tuesdays from 4:00 to 6:00 (Note the time change) at the Elks Lodge in Tillamook. We are using the hall upstairs.  It is a good idea to call before you make the trip to see if we have enough folks for a square.  For up to date information see: www.wavesteppers.org.
