Proof of vaccinations are no longer being required when attending an M&M dance and wearing a mask is now optional.  As far as our calendar goes - we will be dancing on October 1st with caller Randy Dibble and cuer Jeanine Norden but we will be dark on October 15th.  We will also be dark on November 5th, but dancing on November 17th at which time we will be celebrating our 38th Birthday.    Randy will be calling this “Floor Level” Anniversary dance so all Mainstream & Plus dancers are welcome.  And of course there will be cake and ice cream!
