In August we had fairly good attendance, 3 to 4 squares, at our mainstream dances on August 6th and August 20th.  Mike Stout called, and Julie Stout cued both those dances. On August 21st, the TVC picnic and barn dance was held at our members Bette and Gary Hahn's farm.  There were 71 dancers.  Darrell Kalmbach called, and Tami Helms cued.  A great time was had by all!

October will be an especially busy month for our club as we are co-hosting the Seaside Sashay Square Dance Festival.  The dance will be held at the Seaside convention center on Friday,  October 21st and Saturday, October 22nd.  Callers will be Steve Noseck & Randy Dibble; Debbie Taylor will be the cuer.  We hope you will sign up and join us!  For more information, call Gary Clark at 503-310-3538. 

We will have a special dance on October 1st as it is our 37th anniversary!  Darrell Kalmbach will be calling, and Tami Helm's will be cueing.  We are planning to have a lasagna dinner at 6:00 before the dance that night.  We'd love to see you there!  October 15th will be our regular mainstream dance with guest caller Scott Zinser and cuer Tami Helms.
