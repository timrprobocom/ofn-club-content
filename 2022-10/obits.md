After a brief battle with cancer, Charlotte passed away peacefully on September 10, 2022, with family at her side.

Born January 1, 1937, in San Francisco to William H. and Charlotte M. Cupples, she has lived in Claremont CA; Ashland OR; Forest Grove OR; and spent her last years in Albany OR.

During Charlotteâ€™s time in Oregon you could find her at square dances wearing dresses she had meticulously sewn with her husband Ernie cueing the dance. As a direct descendent of the Miller family, it was those ancestors who founded Millersburg that brought her to Albany and the Willamette Valley. Her love of genealogy and family history, antiques and precious knick-knacks filled her life and her home in Albany. A founding member and on the board of directors for the Miller Cemetery Association she spent years coordinating clean-up days and researching the Miller and Simison/Hale historic cemeteries, working tirelessly to maintain these Linn County landmarks.

Charlotte was preceded in death by her husband Ernie Powell, her brother John (Jack) May, her daughter Liza, and grandchild Bryony. She is survived by daughter Leslie Butkovich, son-in-law Adrian Butkovich, son John Nesbitt, grandchildren Jon, Amanda, Reggie, Heather, Sarah, Joshua and eight great grand children.

Instead of flowers, please consider donating to the Miller Cemetery Association of Millersburg, 445 N. 7th St. Harrisburg, OR 97446. There are no plans for an immediate service, but a Memorial Day 2023 memorial event is being planned at the Miller Cemetery. Community announcements and notices to all Miller Cemetery Association members will go out when plans are finalized.
