The club met for their annual meeting and elected the officers, discussed the changes to the Federation By-Laws and voted on them. We also discussed moving our annual meeting to the spring so we can be on time for directory information, lesson plans for the fall, and getting ready to fill out the insurance renewal papers that come in September. The officers will be installed on September 3, before our regular dance.

We honored some members who have given of their time over an extended amount of time. The new Honored Members are Barbi Ashwill, Roger and Linda Bergerson, Pete and LaVerne Bennett, and Ron Schmit. (See the September OFN for their pictures.)

The contracts for the caller, George Hermann, and the cuer, Molly Fairly, were renewed for another year. Molly’s contract went from substitute status to full time status.

The flyer for lessons has been updated with the new membership person’s contact information and posted on Facebook and in the OFN. Another meeting will be held to set up special dances and any other special events that need to be discussed.
