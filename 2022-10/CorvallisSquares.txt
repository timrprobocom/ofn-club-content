The Corvallis Squares met over Labor Day weekend for a barbecue and meeting to kick off the dance year! We are excited for lessons starting at the end of September, taught by Sandy Harris. 

We will have two dances in October, on the second and fourth Saturdays, and the Oct. 8 dance is at a different location than usual: the Corvallis Community Center (formerly called the Senior Center). Our Halloween dance will be at our usual location at the First Congregational church. There is plenty of parking at both locations. We will update our protocols as time and circumstances lead, but currently vaccinations are required; masks are optional. Of course, if dancers feel ill, it is best to stay homeâ€”we would love to have you but need to be safe!
