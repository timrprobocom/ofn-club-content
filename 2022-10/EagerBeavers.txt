Eager Beavers decided to postpone our annual picnic from August to September due to the heat.  However, we are blessed to have air conditioning for our dances at the Aloha Grange, where we average three to four squares.  Our club is delighted to have welcomed five new members in the past couple of months!

We dance Plus and Rounds every Monday afternoon from 1:00 to 3:00, including holidays.  Our excellent teams on the stage include caller/cuer Jim Hattrick, alternating with caller Darrell Kalmbach and cuer Jeanine Norden.  As Jim is currently recovering from a fall, Craig Abercrombie is scheduled as our caller/cuer for the Labor Day dance.  We send prayers and best wishes to Jim and his family. Though most of our dancers are vaccinated, we currently do not require proof of vaccination and masks are optional.  For current information, please see our website at http://EagerBeavers.info.
