title: To my Square Dance Family
---
I have been concerned for some time, that we as a society have forgotten just how valuable our volunteers are.  These are the people that are usually working behind the scenes and most of the time do the bulk of the work for most of our activities.
In Square Dancing there are no paid positions except for the callers and cuers.  This puts the mundane duties of club officers, council officers, and state officers to our VOLUNTEERS!!!!!  Not to mention any festival or extra dances that are attended by the dancers.

As we watch our beloved pastime slowly dwindle in number, we see the same people doing the same jobs over and over, without others that are willing to fill their shoes so they can rest.  The result of this is we are now losing whole clubs due to burnout of the volunteers that make the clubs possible.

Many of us have had the privilege of dancing without having to do the work of the volunteers.  Then we complain about what did not go the way we think it should, and, regardless of whether we have done the volunteer job in the past, we criticize the way its being done without knowing the challenges that were presented to those who are trying to make it good for us.

I wish we would all look at what makes a volunteer want to volunteer again.   Thank You is like gold to a volunteer.  Praise is like platinum.  Encouragement is the grease that gets the job done with satisfaction.  THIS IS THE ONLY PAY A VOLUNTEER GETS!!!!!

If you think the job done is not to your approval, please step up and volunteer to do so and relieve our tired volunteers who have done the jobs for so long.

The volunteers who have kept this activity for so long deserve for us to thank them and keep the traditions alive with our volunteer help.  Lets not let this wonderful activity die without a major fight to save it.  

IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER AND NOT BE JUDGMENTAL WE HAVE A CHANCE.  If we continue to let the same people burn out and then criticize their efforts, then we can watch and let Square Dancing die.

So, to you who have done so much to help I say THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.  To the rest of us, Lets step up and help.

Thank you for your attention
