We are back to calling, cueing and teaching squares and rounds.  It's been a LONG two years, and we've all managed to stay healthy.  Whew!  

Roger Putzler will teach squares starting October 4 at 7:00 and Plus at 8:30.  Tuesdays.  This is at the Dance Center in Springfield.  The floor is cushioned!  

Christina Corelli will begin Waltz Basics October 3 at 7:00.  Because of the late start this class will be an hour and a half or more long each Monday.  No intermediate classes until January. 

Cuer Christina Corelli recently got married to Jake Westra.  Hopefully she'll get him interested in square dancing!  That would be fun!

Our next Fifth Saturday Dance is December 31, but that is usually asked for by a local club.  Can you believe it'll be 2023!  The Fifth Saturdays in 2023 include April 29, July 29, September 30, and December 30.  

We are continuing to stay safe with our members being vaccinated, etc.  We continue having hand sanitizers available as well.

Welcome back to calling, cueing, teaching and dancing! 

Keep on calling and cueing!
Christina Corelli
