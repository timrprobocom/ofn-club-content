Six of our members enjoyed camping at Champoeg State Park Aug. 30 to Sept. 1. We had beautiful weather, and it was cooler by the river. On Wednesday night, we were joined by three more members, five guests, and three dogs for a great potluck and games. 
Our lessons began on September 11 from 5:00 â€“ 6:30 p.m. at the McMinnville Grange. September 17 was our first dance for the season. We have air conditioning at the Grange, so come join us on the third Saturday of the month.
