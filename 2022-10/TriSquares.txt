August was super busy for Tri Squares because we moved our club to the Kinton Grange on Scholls Ferry Road, about 5 miles west.  Also we manned an informational booth at the Tigard Farmers Market to advertise fall lessons at the Kinton Grange.  And adding to all that were two visitations, to the River City Dancers in Portland and Valley River Dancers in Newberg, plus our annual laid-back picnic on the hill, at Sherwood's Snyder Park - always so relaxing! 

In October, since Kinton Grange was already booked up for our first dance night, we'll have fun in Aloha visiting the Hoedowner's instead.  And for our second dance night Friday, October 28th, please put on your best Halloween duds and join us for "Come As You Aren't!" with our caller Terry Halley and cuer Sandra Pinion.  Note:  our new starting time is earlier this year -- 7:00 PreRounds and 7:30 for Mainstream, Rounds & Plus. ($7 donation.  Masks are optional but will be required if the CDC recommends indoor masking that week.  We'll have some extras on hand.)
