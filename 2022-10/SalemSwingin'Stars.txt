Greetings to all dancers. 

We had two great dances in August, even in the heat. September 14 started our Mainstream lessons from 6:30-8:00 pm. A new Plus Workshop then begins from 8:00-9:30 pm. Randy Dibble is the Caller Instructor for both lessons.

September gives us three dances for the month. Sept 16 was our Annual Corn and Cluck Dance and this year the Chicken and corn on the cob were BACK with all sorts of other delicious treats. Also, wind-up chicken races happened again this year. September 30 is our 5th Friday Plus dance. 

October 7 is our 1st Friday Dance in October. Several members of the club and our caller Randy Dibble will be attending the Seaside Sashay October 21-22, 2022, so we will be DARK on the third Friday. Come join us in Seaside! See you on the dance floor.
