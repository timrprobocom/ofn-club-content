The TVC monthly meeting in August was officiated by Ursula Kuhn, TVC President, and held via Zoom.  There were 19 attendees discussing various topics including the upcoming vote requested by the Federation to amend the Federation By-Laws.  The delegates were reminded to advise their clubs of the timeliness of the request.  Ballots need to be received by the 15th of September, prior to the State meeting on the 18th.

While the temperature was a little on the high side, the annual Hahn Barn dance was a success with nearly nine squares of attendees.  Darrell Kalmbach and Tami Helms called and cued a lively dance.  Another of the meeting discussions was the possible changing of the Barn dance from August to September, maybe being a little cooler.  The TVC Directories for 2022-2023 were distributed to the clubs at the dance.

There are two Council club sponsored annual events occurring this month: Octoberfest, October 14-15, hosted by R Square D in Kelso Washington; and Seaside Sashay, October 21-22, hosted by the Sunset Promenaders & Hayshakers. There is additional information in the respective club reports below as well as "Special Dances" flyers.

The Council highly recommends that all TVC dancers attend the anniversary dances held by other member clubs.  Since the OFN is published about the 20th of the month, you still have time to plan on attending the Tri-Squares 24th Anniversary Dance at the Kinton Grange on â€‹September 23rd and the Sunset Promenaders 37th Anniversary Dance on October 1st at the Hillsboro IOOF hall.  Both dances begin at 7pm.
