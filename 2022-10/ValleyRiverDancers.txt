The theme chosen for our 4th Friday Mainstream September dance (September 23rd) is Harvest.  Several of our members are looking forward to attending Seaside Sashay this year as the event does not conflict with our dance night this year.  Our caller, Randy Dibble, is a featured caller at the festival this year.
