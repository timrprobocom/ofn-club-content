R Square D wrapped up our summer schedule with fun dances in August and enjoyed ice cream after each one! We had a booth at Longviewâ€™s Squirrel Fest on August 20th and handed out hundreds of flyers and cards promoting our lessons.

October 14-15 is our Octoberfest weekend! We are looking forward to this after having to cancel it in 2020 and 2021. It promises to be great fun with Craig Abercrombie and Adam Christman calling and Susan Healea cueing. Saturday evening includes a German dinner and a performance by River City Riders prior to the dance. See our flyer for more information.

We will go dark on October 22nd so our members may attend the Seaside Sashay.  Hope to see many of our dancers there!
