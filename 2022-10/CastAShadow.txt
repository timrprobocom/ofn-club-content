We continue to dance twice a month on the 2nd and 4th Sundays when we can muster a square.  Lately we are just shy of two squares and wish we could find a few more so weâ€™d have two squares on the floor and not have so many have to sit out waiting their turn.  We dance with cards so everyone does get a turn, and we keep every other break short.

We dance at the Emerald Square Dance Center in Springfield from 1:30 to 3:30 in Hall B which is located behind the square dance center so please drive around and park behind to find us.

We mostly dance to recorded tips by national callers with Fred Beisse wearing a stop watch on his wrist so he can stop the music when we break down and then be able to go back to review where the problem was.  Most everyone is back up to speed at this point after having not danced for the most part of two and a half years.

On Sunday, October 30, we are hoping to have Kris Jensen from New Mexico call for us.  We all love Kris and her calling and we hope we can get enough people out and that she can make it.

Please come join us if you are in the vicinity or within driving distance.  First check our website at cas-sd.yolasite.com for our schedule of dances and then call Fred at 458-221-3564  to make sure we are dancing on that particular day.. We would love to have you in a square!
