The club will start tango lessons on November 3, providing Randy has recovered sufficiently from his hip replacement surgery that he had scheduled on September 12. Until then, we are dancing from 7:00-9:00 p.m. every Thursday. We will dance after his surgery, with maybe one substitute the week of his surgery, but after that he says he can sit and cue since his mouth is not being worked on.

Randy had a birthday on August 31, and we surprised him with cake and cards the next night, our regular dance night. We are hoping that he was surprised and pleased. 

We will start thinking about New Yearâ€™s Eve soon since we have the hall reserved.
