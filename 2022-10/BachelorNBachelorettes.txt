Our lessons are off to a good start.  So far, we are under the unique situation where all our students are composed of people who were once members of other Portland clubs.  All they really need is a refresher, enabling us to move through lessons very quickly and finish well before Mid-Winter.  If you know someone else who just needs a refresher, maybe you could steer them our way?  Once again, our lessons are on Wednesday evenings at 6:30.  Our regular dances will follow at 7:30, only on 1st, 3rd and 5th Wednesdays.
