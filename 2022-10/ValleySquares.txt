The Hahn Barn picnic and dance was lots of fun and also hot.  It was good to take a break occasionally under the trees with a nice breeze.  

Our August 20th dance was very nice with some of Oak Hills Squares graduated students attending.  Mark Wheeler called for us in his Elvis outfit.  He is also Oak Hills caller/instructor. 

Beginning in October the Valley Squares will begin having our two dances a month on different days than we have in the past.  Our dances will be on the 1st Fridays and 3rd Saturdays.

Our first dance in October will be on the 7th, a first Friday, from 7-9:30 pm at the Aloha Grange, MS with every 3rd tip Plus. Craig Abercrombie calling with Connie Clark cueing. Come join us and make this a great dance!  

October 15th is our 3rd Saturday dance, Spooky Dance featuring Mark Wheeler and Connie Clark, see you there also.  

Keep Dancing,
Carolene Siebert
