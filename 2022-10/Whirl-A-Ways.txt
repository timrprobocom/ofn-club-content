It's been a long two-years for Whirl-A-Ways!  We are happy to be back dancing at the hall in Springfield!

John and Carolyn Pape hosted a successful picnic/potluck at their beautiful place in east Springfield.  Thank you John and Carolyn!  Kathy Jensen provided door prizes which included a few she painted.  We've got a lot of talented people in our club!  Thanks Kathy!

Roger Putzler will begin new dancer lessons October 4 at 7:00.  Plus lessons will be at 8:30 on Tuesdays.  We encourage angels to attend.  Thank you!  This is open to all:  families, singles and couples.  There is a family rate for families with 2 or more kids.  

Christina Corelli will begin teaching Waltz Basics October 3 at 7:00.  There will be no intermediate classes until January because of the late start this fall.  

Our cuer, Christina, married Jake Westra recently.  We wish them a long and happy marriage!  Jake and Christina attended the Whirl-a-Ways camp out in June. Jake loved it and is looking forward to the next one!  He can't wait! Jake's brother Nate and his wife, Ruxie, danced with Wagon Wheelers a number of years ago.  

All dances and classes will be at the Emerald Dance Center, 2095 Yolanda in Springfield. 

Happy dancing!
Christina Corelli
