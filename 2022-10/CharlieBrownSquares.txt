Our first night of classes went well with 9 new dancers and 3 squares on the floor. We hope for some more new dancers and angels at our last open night on Sept 20th.  We look forward to having a great group ready to learn!  No dances in September and we were disappointed that the Rogue Valley Rendevoux was canceled.  We look forward to attending that festival in 2023.

Our October dances should be a lot of fun!! On Oct 1st we have J Domis calling & Elaine Funk cueing. The fun starts at 7pm.  J is an energetic and fun caller who has a network that will follow him to his dances. We are making this dance open to both experienced dancers like normal and J is also sending out invites to his groups to come and join us as well. The last time J did a dance we had 75 dancers in the hall!!! Hoping for a similar turnout!!  Elaine always does a great job cueing - so it should be a wonderful nite!! Oct 15th we have Chuck & Sarge. We invite you to "Don't Be A Grouch, Come Dance With Us!" Put on your smile and join us for a great time.  Jumping ahead a little bit to our 55th birthday dance on December 3rd---we are excited to have Randy Dibble calling our dance for us.  He is always a treat to get to dance to!! Please join us for lots of fun!!

We have lots of fun dances happening the rest of the year - and more scheduled for 2023. Don't forget to pre-register for an amazing Memorial Weekend for our Boatnik Festival with Joe Saltel & Randy (Marie) Preskitt!!!  Going to be a heck of a party!!!
See you on the dance floor!
