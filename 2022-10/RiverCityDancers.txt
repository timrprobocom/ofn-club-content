We danced all summer every second and fourth Saturday in the comfort of our air-conditioned hall and continue to do so each month. 

We began our square dance lessons on September 18 at 5:30 . They are for one and a half hour each and will be held weekly. Our round dance lessons will begin October second. They are $6 each, or you can save money by purchasing 12 lessons in advance for $60. 

Dust off your shoes and come dancing with us. You are always welcome.  The fun begins as soon as you walk in the door.
