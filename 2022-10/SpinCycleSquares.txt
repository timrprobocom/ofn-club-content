We dance every Sunday from 4 - 6 at the dance center in Springfield on Yolanda.  Tim Matteson is a great caller and will call whatever level we can muster.  We've had a few fairly new dancers who are having a great time and some who have indicated they'd love to join Spin Cycle Squares!  Yippee! We have individually wrapped snacks on hand.   We invite you all to join us!  We're a fun bunch that's for sure. All dances are casual.  

Our member-at-Large, Christina recently got married to Jake Westra! Congratulations!  

Please call our president, David Lajoie,at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are, indeed, dancing.  Once in a blue moon we are dark.
