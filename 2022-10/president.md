Hello everyone. I would like to share the following statement with you.

<i>To further the common good and general welfare of the people of its communities and to bring about civic betterment and social improvements in the education, promotion and encouragement of square dancing and its related activities, without regard to race, creed, sex, age, national origin, or religion.</i>

This is our purpose, the reason that we as square & round dancers have established the Oregon Federation organization. As President, I want to emphasize that everyone in our organization is a volunteer. Each of us have talents that we can share to accomplish our purpose. I would like to thank all of those who have done that, and I hope that you will continue help me to keep our organization thriving. 

As time goes on, the ways that we accomplish this purpose may change. I am asking you as members of our federation to let me know what changes you believe may need to be made. As always there will be problems to solve, however, there may be successes to share as well. I would like to have both. This will allow me to determine what you as members believe deserves my attention while I am president.

One thing that I want to do is, take a thorough look at our By-laws & P&P’s. Both documents are ‘living’ documents. As our organization evolves, we may need to shed some things no longer needed and to add new ways of accomplishing our purpose. If you believe that you can help me with this, please let me know, my name is in the book.

Happy Dancing,   
Timothy Keck   
President, OFSRDC
