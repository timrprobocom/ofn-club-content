### Federation Meetings

Your Federation Executive Board met in Aurora on September 19, where the new officers for the 2022-23 year took over:

* President, Tim Keck, PAC
* 1st Vice President, Karyn Buchheit, MWA
* 2nd Vice President, Pat Cox, SCC
* Secretary, Lorri McIntosh, RSQ
* Treasurer, Marilyn Schmit, MWA
* Membership Chairman, Gil Shoemaker, PAC

The two proposed amendments to the Federation By-Laws were both passed by the clubs by an overwhelming margin, which means 2nd Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer and Membership will now have two year terms.  The 1st VP/President/Past President sequence will remain a 3-year commitment.
 
The next Federation meeting will be hosted by the Emerald Empire Council, and will be held at the Line County Fairgrounds on January 29, 2023, in conjunction with Mid-Winter Festival.
