 Sunset Promenaders are dancing 1st and 3rd Saturdays at the Odd Fellows Hall in Hillsboro starting at 7pm till 9:30 pm. The Plus Dancers are dancing 1st ,3rd and 5th Thursday of the month with same times 7 to 9:30 pm.
 We have changed our rules just a touch. Still need to wear a mask or face shield but also need to show proof of vaccination. We understand if you choose not to be vaccinated but this is to make sure our members are safe.
 By the time this comes out we will have had our Promenaders anniversary dance and we will post our numbers next month. Our Plus side is having its Anniversary dance the first Thursday of November which happens to be the 4th with the same starting time as our regular dances.
 Mike and Julie Stout will be working our  mainstream dances and Darrell /Erin Kalmbach and Tami Helms/Tim Keck will be working the Plus Dances.
