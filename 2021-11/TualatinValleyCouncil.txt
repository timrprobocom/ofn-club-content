 The September TVC meeting was held via Zoom.  We will continue the Zoom meetings through at least October.  A new venue for our in person meetings has still not been found.
 The TVC sponsored Tri-Council dance on October 30th at the Kinton Grange was cancelled due to Covid concerns and the worry there would be a lack of dancers to support the venue.
 The annually published TVC directory has been completed and is pending distribution to the member clubs.  Like everything else the distribution effort has been difficult.
 Message from TVC President, Mike St Clair: "We are working on the New Years Eve dance in December.  Hopefully there will be more clubs up and running by then.  We have the OK to have it at the Odd Fellows Hall in Hillsboro.  We are currently working on lining up callers and cuers.  We will be requiring masks or face shields and you will have to be vaccinated to participate."
 There are currently six of the TVC clubs dancing on a regular basis: Columbia River Dancers, Eager Beavers, Hoedowners, Oak Hills Squares, Sunset Promenaders, and Valley Squares.  See their individual reports below.  Most require proof of vaccination to attend.
