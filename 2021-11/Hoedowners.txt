 September just slipped away in a haze of sunny days and one torrential downpour.  As these days pass, our dancing is returning to its normal pattern.  Thank heavens!!  Are you dancing yet?  Our summer series of two-step classes wrapped up the Tuesday after Labor Day and now we’re onto cha.  We’ve resumed our regular schedule of square dances on the 2nd and 4th Saturday evenings, 7pm at the Aloha Grange.
 On September 11th, Scott Zinser and Randy Lewis did a fine job entertaining us through the evening.  It was a full night rounds, plus and position moves.  On the 25th we enjoyed listening to Leonard Snodgrass and Connie Clark.  Thank heavens for cell phones!   Leonard got caught in traffic on I-5 but was able to alert us.  The dance was delayed a few minutes, but we didn’t have to wonder or worry about the delay. 
 Mike Duyck, long time Hoedowner, TVC representative and all-around square dance booster, has recently had neck surgery.  The doctor and Sally are trying to keep him quiet and rested at home.  How long do you think that will last?  We’ll keep you posted.
 Our November dances will kick off on November 13th with our Annual Turkey Toss Dance.  Better start practicing with your bean bag now.  K.C. Curtis will be our caller and Randy Lewis spinning rounds.
 November 27th we’ll have Darrell Kalmbach and Randy Lewis on stage.  That will also be Civil War weekend.  Oh, oh, the OSU, U of O game.  Call it what you will, we’re dancing!  I wouldn’t be surprised to see a bit of green or orange in the crowd.
 We’re all well, following the rules and dancing.
