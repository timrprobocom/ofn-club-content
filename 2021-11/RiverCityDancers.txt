We give special thanks to our PAC president, Robert Lumsden, for suggesting on the council web site that dancers support and visit other clubs. He went a step further and suggested that they come to River City Dancers October 9 club dance. We had 56 dancers including Robert Lumsden and his wife Young.  We also wish to thank Country Cut Ups, Chaps and Petticoats, B&Bâ€™s, Silver City Squares, Valley Squares, Happy Hoppers, Eager Beavers, Tri Squares and Oaky Doaks for attending and supporting us. You all added so much fun and friendship to our dance.

All our clubs are struggling at this time and it is more important than ever that we as a square dance family support each other. Together we can make a difference and assure that square dancing is around for many years to come. Thank you once again. 

Our club continues to dance every second and third Saturday from 7:30-9:30 PM in Milwaukie at 42nd and Jackson.  We will be having lessons after the first of next year.

See you in a square. Happy dancing.
Carol Mendenhall
