Some good news at last for the advanced dancers in our area!  We hope to offer two dances in November on the 7th and 21st, both Sundays from 1:30 to 3:30PM.  We had to close down in August due to the surge in COVID-19 Delta cases in the area and state.  Things are beginning to return to normal (a new norm actually) so if they continue to go downwards we might have some advanced dances in Hall B of the Emerald Square Dance Center.  As always, we will dance to recorded tips monitored by Fred Beisse with his stopwatch ready to stop the music and go back to go over passages we have difficulty withâ€”and now that we have not be been dancing for so long thre is likely to be many of them.  But we expect some good dancing after we are all back in sync.  Please come join us if you are in the area or can drive in to visit us.  
We will ask that everyone be fully vaccinated and masks will be mandated if the Govrnor says so.
See you in a square soon,
Gaynor Hintz, Club reporter
