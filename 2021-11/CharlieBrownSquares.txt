Oh my!! What a wonderful dance we had with Mike Seastrom & Rikki Lobato on October 16th. It was an absolute blast!!!  Mike is such a joy to dance to! There were a consistent 4 squares of Mainstream and 3 squares of Plus. There were also a lot of round dancers; about 12 couples the whole nite dancing.  What fun!!! Those that missed it, really missed out!!!
Our next dance will be November 6th w/Phil Ramey & Elaine Funk.  Then November 20th we will have Chuck Simpkins & Sarge Glidewell.  We are excited about our birthday dance on December 4th with Pat Carnathan and Rikki Lobato. Then Roger Putzler and Rikki end the year on December 18th with a Christmas themed dance.  We look forward to ending the year with lots of dancing.
Our classes started and we welcomed a couple of new dancers and some "retreads."  Hopefully we get a few more on our last nite of open classes on Oct 20th.  Our Plus class/funshop is going well.
We are happy to have a dance under our belt and hope this means we can continue dancing; masked and armed with smiles. We look forward to seeing everyone soon.
