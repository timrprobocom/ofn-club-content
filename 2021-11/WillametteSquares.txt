Willamette Squares is anxious to get back to our regular dancing schedule which is the fourth Saturday of every month. We are resuming with our birthday dance on the fourth Saturday of October. Please come and help us celebrate our years together as a club at the Salem Square Dance Center at 7:00 PM. In the interest of safety for all, we ask that everyone wear a mask, whether vaccinated or not. Happy birthday Willamette Squares!
