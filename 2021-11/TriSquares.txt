 Our club is still feeling very cautious about dancing yet.  We're roughly  planning to begin again in January, but it all depends on whether the pandemic is lessening.  We cancelled our Zoom board meeting in October because so little had changed, but our monthly "Gabfest" continues for all club members to chat with each other on Zoom. 
 At our November board meeting we will discuss the problems of dancing again, in regards to vaccinations and testing and how we would handle those issues, without upsetting people.  I expect it will be a long discussion, but I'm optimistic that we can figure it out. 
 Best wishes to everyone - stay safe, stay well.
