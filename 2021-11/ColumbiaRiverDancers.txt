Coming back to dancing seems to ever so slowly begin to expand.  Our dances so far are about three squares.  We have found that dancing with a mask on is not the burdensome task that we thought it to be.  Lessons  seem to be going well and the club has added four new members since we have been back. 
 It is not often that you can tell someone that they look good after gaining weight, but our caller has been under the weather for some time and he is starting to look more like his old self.
 Now, November is going to be a good month for everyone to see our new hall.  We start the month off with Jim Hattrick getting us into the beginning of the holiday season.  He will do the calling and cueing for our dance on November 5th.  Plus dancing will be from 7 to 8 and mainstream the rest of the evening with rounds between tips.
 On Friday, November 19th we will have Dan Nordbye, just back from his nationwide tour, to do our calling at our Harvest Party.  Julie Stiers will honor us with her cueing.  
 Lastly, for all of you that are beginning to learn square dancing, our club will be having a Beginners Dance on December 5th.  Jim will call the dance to the level of the floor.  So start learning and put the date on your calendar.
 That is all for now.  Hope to see you in a square.
