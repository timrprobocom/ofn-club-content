We are back to dancing and we have 12 students in our mainstream class. Most of them are youth but all are having fun, with usually three squares at lessons.

We are planning to have both 2-step and plus lessons starting in November. They will be on Sunday afternoons. Please watch for the flyer - it will be posted soon. Petrina Buchheit
