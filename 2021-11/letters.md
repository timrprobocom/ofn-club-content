title: Mid-Winter Festival Resale Clothing
---
Is your closet bulging at the seams?  Are you hankering to recycle some of your older square dance or round dance clothes?  Or, have you moved on and are no longer able to join in the festivities.

Well, Mid-Winter Festival is fast approaching.  For many of you it provides an opportunity to recycle a few or many of those outfits taking up space in your closets.  For others, it is a sad time when you are saying, “I just can’t dance anymore”, and you want someone else to enjoy those beautiful outfits you have received so much pleasure wearing over the years.

But first let’s look closely at some key tips to selling your clothing items at Mid-Winter Festival 2022.  Follow closely the on-line instructions and email your list of items in by January 17, 2022.  

Note:  If you are having any problems completing the form on line, then by all means hand write it and mail it in.  We will input it to the computer for you.  This will save you a lot of time at the consignment tables when you deliver your items to Mid Winter.  If you snail mail your list, it must be received by January 10, 2022.
Please, read the instructions very, very carefully.

Make sure the items are clean and in good repair. Square and Round dance clothing only, please.

Bring your items, listed by categories to simplify the tagging process to the consignment tables.

If you have sets, keep/place them together.  This will help in the tagging process and may even help them to sell.

Please, be early to consignment.  Be sure to check the hours and plan on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning so they will be prominently placed on the racks for the opening sales activity Friday evening.

As with so many activities it is getting more and more difficult to get volunteers to help.  Resale Clothing is one of those areas that require a large number of volunteers to make it available for all the dancers.  

We can no longer accept clothing items at the festival that were not listed for consignment before the input deadline.

We are sorry it has come to this.  But we hope you will utilize the on-line submission process.  Or you can hand write it and send it to us.  Just print out the input/submission sheet for completion by hand.  We want to help you recycle the many beautiful outfits that you all have. 

As I said earlier we require a large number of volunteers to assist during consignment and sale hours.  We will accept any help, even if for just one (1) hour.  So, contact the volunteer coordinator for Resale Clothing – Sheila - and let her know you want to help.

Don’t forget to pick up your returns by 10:00 a.m. on Sunday morning.

For assistance contact the following individual -- preferably by email.

We will be adhering to all Covid-19 restrictions that are in place at the time.
