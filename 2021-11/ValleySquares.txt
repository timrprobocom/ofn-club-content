 So far, all our members are well.  We do ask that if you have not gotten the Covid vaccine that you do so right away.  We need to keep everyone well and feeling safe.  So far, I have not heard of any dancer who has not been vaccinated.  Thank you everyone for that.  
 Our November dance is the third Saturday, Nov 20, 7 - 9 pm with Craig Abercrombie calling and Connie cueing.  
 Come join us, we'd love to dance with you.  I support the three clubs in my area, Hoedowners, Eager Beavers, and Sunset Promenaders, who are dancing right now.  It feels so good to dance, even with a mask or shield.  
 Hope to see you in a square,
  Carolene Siebert
