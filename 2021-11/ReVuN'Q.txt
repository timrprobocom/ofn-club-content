The club continues to dance weekly and we are averaging 7-11 couples weekly. The rumba lessons from 6:00-7:00 p.m. are going well and the dancers seem to be having fun and enjoying the hour together.

The phase 3-4 waltz class is adding to their knowledge of steps and putting some styling in their moves. I am trying to learn the boy’s part and I think I am confused. Easily done!

This article is written before our “Don’t Match” dance happened so look for pictures on Facebook after the 16th to see what fun we had.
 
Happy Thanksgiving to all our dancing friends. Marilyn Schmit
