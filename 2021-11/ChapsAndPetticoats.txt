Chaps and Petticoats (C&P) hosted a” Pirate” dance on October 1st, Scott Zinser called and /Tami Helms cued.  There were guest Callers and a Cuer, we had three squares + 6 more individuals and several people dressed to win prizes.  Lots of turn out in three clubs:  Bachelor & Bachelorettes (B&B’s), Country Cut-Ups and Silver City Squares .  Our three judges, Karyn, Pat and Jay, made their decisions in record time:  Male: winner C&P Pres. Bill, Female-Miss ‘bowtie eyelashes’ MaryJane and Couple was Young & Robert.  It was a night of threes - thank you judges and all who made this dance super fun!

We held three SEPT Sunday-nights of Square Dance lessons but had too-few students, thus elected to delay further lessons till later.  Thank you, Angels, for such a fabulous support group!  

Portland Area Council (PAC) encouraged area clubs to visit River City Dancers (RCD) on OCT 9th - there were six (6) squares (and a little more) - WOW!  B&B’s, C&P, Buzzin’ Bees, Cut-Ups, Oaky Doaks produced two+ squares, combined with RCD’s own members and TVC clubs - we all danced with masks or shields, sanitized and honored the mandates but got our hugs.  Felt great to see a Club, RCD, prosper during COVID.  Thank you Darrell Kalmbach and Julia Buchheit for Calling and Cueing.  Way to go, Pres. Lumsden for encouraging these dances.

Chaps and Petticoats have changed our 3rd-Sunday Dance to PLUS format from 5-7 PM on NOV 21st - check the C&P website for more 1st & 3rd Friday dance info in NOV.

Happy Feet
