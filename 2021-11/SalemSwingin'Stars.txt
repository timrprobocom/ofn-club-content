We were quite sad to have to cancel our Mainstream beginner lessons. We will try again in January. However, our Plus level lessons/workshop has been well attended and we will continue on Wednesdays from 7:00-9:00 pm.

November is the month to remember to be Thankful for all the good things we have. 
The ability to dance (even with restrictions) and to gather (safely). We feel thankful and blessed by our club members who continue to join us for dances and to all of the dancers from other clubs who continue to support our activity. 

In October, we have three dances and two dances in November. October 29 is the 5th Friday Plus Halloween Dance with special guest Caller Don Wood joining Randy Dibble. Check our Face Book page for the latest on our dances. Sheila Machado
