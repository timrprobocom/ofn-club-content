12/15/1931 - 09/29/2021

Elfriede Luise Greuner was born in Karlsruhe, Germany to Ernst & Emilie (Fahrer) Huber on December 15, 1931. After finishing her dressmaker apprenticeship, she moved to Canada, where she married and had two daughters. The family moved to New York where they lived for several years. In time, they decided to make the cross-country journey to California to start a family business, Hergert Industries, which eventually relocated to Drain, OR.

Elfriede faced many challenges in life, but always persevered and approached each one with a can-do attitude and a smile on her face. She worked as dressmaker for many years and loved to help her clients look and feel amazing in whatever they wore. Whether the job entailed a simple alteration or the fabrication of a custom square dance dress or wedding dress, Elfriede loved to use her hands to create something special for every customer. Her love for her family was only outweighed by her devotion to God. Family was the most important thing in Elfriede's life followed by her dressmaking and square dancing, all of which brought great joy in her life.

Elfriede was called from this life on September 29, 2021, at the age of 89.

Elfriede is survived by her daughter Pearl Hergert; Grandchildren, Lisa Ronco, Marie Montgomery, Cody Lytle & Katie Lytle and 7 Great Grandchildren.

Services will be held on Saturday, October 16, 2021, at 10:00am at Mohawk Community Church in Springfield, OR. A reception will immediately follow.
