And just like that, it’s November. This year seems to be moving fast in spite of the COVID pandemic. Hope you all had a safe Halloween and didn’t eat too much candy. :)

Some clubs have had success with dancing, other clubs have had light attendance. A lot of folks are still hesitant to come out and socialize.  I am hoping that attendance will pick up as the year goes on. But, the low attendance at dances so far has impacted the registrations for Mid-Winter. Usually at this time of year, we have almost ½ of the registrations needed to make the festival a success.  Because of not being able to promote, we now have less than 100 dancers registered. Not good news. 

Not much else to comment about. Stay safe.  Let’s be thankful for the blessings we have. Happy Thanksgiving and…
