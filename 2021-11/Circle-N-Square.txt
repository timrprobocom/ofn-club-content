Greetings from Yreka,
As I reported last time we are in another holding pattern. The Karuk Wellness Center is still shut down until further notice. And renting other facilities is not an option. They are either too expensive or not renting at all. We have talked to our more active people and the overall concession is no dancing until things get better and the Covid Cases start to decline. Many are like us, that they're not willing to take chances and put their own personal health at risk and have a break through and get this virus. It is a very difficult and personal decision for us and other members, but we will NOT be doing any type of dances and or classes until the first of the year. At which time depending on the current cases and status of our county and the surrounding areas we will again evaluate whether is is safe to start up again. Obviously finding a place to dance will again be a big factor on how we will proceed.
We hope everyone will stay safe and healthy.
Take care
Dean & Sherrie
