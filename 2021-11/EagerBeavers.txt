The Eager Beavers are having great attendance at our recent dances â€“ 3 squares!  Our current COVID safety precautions include wearing masks or face shields and showing proof of vaccinations to attend our dances.  
 On September 20th we welcomed Jim Hattrick back to call and cue for our 3rd Monday dances.  We also have welcomed several new members to our club, so we are having great dances in spite of these crazy times. Come join us every Monday at 1:00 p.m. at the Aloha Grange.
 Sadly we lost our long time beloved member Nan Overall on September 28th .  Nan was very instrumental in keeping the Eager Beavers running smoothly for many years.  She published our "Beaver Log" newsletter for 25 years, received our Swenson award for continued outstanding support of the club and for consistently  promoting square and round dancing.  She also was presented with the TVC Recognition award in 2016.  She is missed, but she had a great life and had reached the age of 92, and as they say on TV "A life well lived".
