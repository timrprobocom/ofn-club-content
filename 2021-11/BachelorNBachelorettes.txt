Our biggest news is that after the first of the year, we will reduce our dance nights to the 1st, 3rd and 5th Wednesdays.  This will be the first change to our dance schedule in the 56 years of our club.  (We no longer have the attendance or volunteers to dance every week.)  For the immediate time being we’ll have a lot of fun, including our Turkey Trot dance this month and our Pre-New Year’s Eve dance on December 29th.
