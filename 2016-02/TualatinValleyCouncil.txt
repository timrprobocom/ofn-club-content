The TVC helped usher in the New Year with a festive good time. Doug Davis called a lively dance with Randy Lewis cueing the rounds.  The evening started with a lasagna dinner, followed by dancing, and then Auld Lang Syne.  The evening was enjoyed by about ten squares of dancers from nine clubs plus independents.  The Sunset Promenaders had the highest percentage of their club in attendance and won the TVC Banner.

Since the OFN is now online and published mid-month, you still have time to consider a January TVC event,  our annual TVC President’s Meeting & Potluck for current and past club Presidents.  It will be held at the Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall on Jan 25th and will include a potluck dinner at 6:00.  A short business meeting will begin at 7:00 followed with TVC President Gary Clark announcing the recipient of the Tualatin Valley Council “Recognition Award” for outstanding service and special contribution to the square dance community within the TVC geographical area.
