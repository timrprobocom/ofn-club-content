It was a busy holiday season for the Oaky Doaks.

Our December kicked off with a first Saturday that featured dancing in the street (and the rain!) at the city-sponsored Barns Dance celebration of a new pedestrian â€˜scrambleâ€™ crossing in downtown Portland. At the Christmas Gospel dance that night, we decked the hall with a silent auction of crafts and other seasonal goodies to spread holiday cheer.

At the annual Holiday Party on December 12th we enjoyed an abundance of potluck contributions, a slightly rowdy gift exchange, and an Ugly Christmas Sweater contest. The next day, hardy members braved the chill to volunteer at the Peninsula Optimist Club Christmas Tree lot. The Club receives a donation for every hour volunteered.

On December 17th the latest class of two-step round dancers graduated. Square dance lessons began January 7th with something a little different: weâ€™re holding No Experience Necessary dances for the first three weeks. This involves teaching a different series of basic calls each week. Traditional format lessons continue from January 27th. 

Our final visitation of 2015 was to the Bachelor â€˜nâ€™ Bachelorettesâ€™ 50â€™s Rock the Night Away New Yearâ€™s Dance Party, where Oaky Doaks caller Mike Halley was calling as one of the Wild Cards. Since this was held on December 30th, some of us were also able to celebrate New Yearâ€™s Eve with the River City Dancers at their Last Hoedown.

The first January dance was the Poor Manâ€™s dance, where we collected canned goods for the Oregon Food Bank and held a Clothing Resale. We just made it home before the snowstorm hit that blanketed the area the next day. Our second dance will be a Hawaiian Luau dance on January 16th. 

Looking ahead, weâ€™re planning for Mid-Winter, of course. We were honored to have eight officials of the Festival Committee at our Turkey Trot dance in November.

The Reigning Cats and Dogs dance on February 6th is a pet food donation fundraiser supporting the companion animals of local low-income participants in the Meals-On-Wheels program. Pet food is distributed by the organization along with its regular food distribution program. Visitors who bring a can/bag of cat or dog food to the dance get $1 off at the door. The third Saturday dance will focus on love songs â€&ldquo; a Sweetheart dance.

February 13th is the annual Valentineâ€™s Brunch when the guys put on the aprons, cook and serve.  

We invite you to join the fun with us at dances on the first and third Saturdays, and at lessons on Thursdays from 7:30-9:30pm.
