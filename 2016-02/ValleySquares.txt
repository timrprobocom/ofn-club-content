Finish off the Football Season by attending our Souper Bowl Dance February 6th at Aloha Grange.  Soup will be served at 6:15, followed by Plus and Pre-Rounds at 7:00, then Mainstream and Rounds from 8-10.  Darrell Kalmbach will be calling and Connie Clark cueing.

In order to provide new dancers an opportunity to attend a "real dance," we are changing our schedule for our second dance in February.  The theme is Chocolate, which will be featured at our open break.  We will start with class-level dancing at 7 p.m., followed by progressively more challenging Mainstream from 8-9, and ending with Plus from 9 to 10.  Please encourage your new dancers and students to take advantage of this opportunity to get in some floor time.  Chuck Garner will be rising to the challenge of spontaneous choreographing for a wide range of experience and Connie Clark will be cueing.

December was a month where our members showed their Christmas spirit by contributing to the canned food drive, the Aloha Grange's Adopted Family, and the Toyota Toy Drive.  We recaptured our flag from Valley River Dancers and stole another from Tri-Squares.  We ended the year by attending either the TVC New Year's Eve dance at Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall, or Valley River's Special Desserts New Year's Eve Dance in Aurora.
