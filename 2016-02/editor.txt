December was a difficult month for the square dance community.  We lost 
raconteur and former Federation President Al Westphal, Central Oregon dancer
Jacque' Talbert, and Tualatin Valley dancers Claire Enloe and Cathy Bailey. 
Obituaries for all four are in the articles section.

Our own Jim Hattrick continues to recover from a stroke that he suffered in 
January while teaching square dance classes.

I am pleased to announce that you can now upload flyers for your lessons.
You may do this on the same "Lessons" page where you enter your lesson
information.  The flyer will carry forward from year to year, so be sure
to check the flyer before you begin new lessons.

I am a bit concerned about the trend in flyers.  We had 55 flyers in 
December, 34 flyers in January, 
but with only a few days to go we still only have 14 flyers for this month.
There are quite a number from TVC, but only 2 from Mid-Willamette, 3 from 
Portland, 3 from Umpqua, and none at all from the other 6 councils.  If 
you have made a decision not do make flyers any more, I'd like to know
why.  Drop me a note.
