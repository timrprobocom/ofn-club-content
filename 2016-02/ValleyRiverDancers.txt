What a celebration we had for New Years! Seven squares of Plus and A2 dancers joined the Valley River Dancers for a swingin' good time to ring in the New Year. There's certainly no better company than square dancers to start a new year on the right foot.

Our new dancers' dance will be held Friday, January 22, at the Newberg Community Center beginning at 7:30 with rounds by Julie Stiers. Our caller, Randy Dibble, promises to take it easy for this one night only!

February is a busy month for us. Romance is in the air on Friday, February 12; grab a date and join us for our Sweetheart Dance (Plus). Friday February 26 is our Anniversary Dance, and we'll be dancing Mainstream, beginning with a half hour of Plus at 7:30. Join us!  Perrin Damon
