Thanks to my long-time friend and fellow dancer, Gail Domine, for standing in for me as OFN reporter for River City Dancers during my period of incapacity after a long bout of serious atrial fibrillation.  I’m not cured but I’m better all the time, and Kaiser Cardiology has plans for more permanent correction during the next month.

River City Dancers enjoyed a fabulous New Year’s Eve event, “The Last Hoedown”, thanks to Vic and Elaine Lancaster, Richard and Carolyn George and their helpers.  Les Seeley and Rene Ruud called, and Patty Herman cued.  The “Chuck Wagon” dinner was great.

Our beloved caller couple, Les and Paula Seeley, have announced that Les will retire as our River City caller at Mid Winter Festival in 2017.  Les and Paula have been with us for over 25 years.  They will be hard to replace but a committee has been convened and will bring recommendations to the club.

Our class graduation was Sunday, January 17th.  We’ve had a great class, and our angels have been superlative, headed by Ron and Barbara Whitworth.  We’re encouraging our new folks to keep dancing,  join a club, and put 2016 Mid Winter Festival on their calendars.  

Jolene and her husband, Ed, have been active supporters for River City Dancers and River City Riders in so many ways.  There is no greater club photographer than Jolene, but she has so many other accomplishments to list.  Among them is heading our Resale Clothing sale, with a profit of $648.  It was a group effort shared by Ron and Barbara Whitworth, Lois Manos and Bert Labedz.

Hopefully you will remember to come dance with us on second and third Saturdays of every month, including the summer months.  We love visitors!  Milwaukie Community Club is our home, 10444 SE 42nd Ave.; Milwaukie 97222.
