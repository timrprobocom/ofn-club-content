 Oh, my goodness, but we had FUN at our December 19 Christmas dance.  The Whirl-A-Ways, Single Trees and Wolf Pack co-sponsored this special dance.  It's always fun, exciting and satisfying to have clubs work together.  We had a little over 8 squares, and dancers dressed up in Christmas colors and bling.  Mike Kious and Roger Putzler did a great job.  Mike's grandpa and grandma (George and Patty Hermann) came too.  Grandpa George called too.  What fun! Christina cued many holidays rounds.

Our own Mimi Mills has retired from the hall board after 24 years being the Hall Coordinator.  Mimi has done many tasks over the years and has made such a positive difference.  Mimi's health is more important right now, and we wish her the best of luck taking care of herself like she has taken care of the rest of us and the dance hall.  There is absolutely no one like Mimi Mills.  Thank you Mimi, and God bless you.  We hope to see you at our dances.  Mimi and her husband, Red, are lifetime members of Danebo Circle 8.

An update on Mimi Mills.  Mimi was admitted to Riverbend Hospital January 3.  We know she will be well taken care of and  pray for her recovery.  You can always e-mail me if you wish an update, and I have a lot of people on my e-mail lists as well.

A number of Danebo Circle Eighters attended the New Year's Eve dance with Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli calling and cueing.  Roger and Christina do this dance as a thank you for the support they receive for their Buccaneers plus dance throughout the year.  The entire evening was $2! The New Year's Eve dance was for all dancers at all levels.   There were also 30 pies and other goodies.  Thank you Roger and Christina!  Roger and Christina are also our own caller and cuer.   

May this new year bring you many blessings, good health and a lot of fun dancing!
 
Keep on dancin!
