After all that December rain, we Ramblers had to wring out our socks to ring in 2016, but we did it in style with our annual Black and White Ball at the Milwaukie Grange. After a delicious dinner (featuring baked ham!), we danced off those Christmas calories in style. Stephen Cole celebrated his ninth year calling this dance for the Ramblers‚Ä&rdquo;and he did it with his usual aplomb. We have already arranged to bring him back for his tenth anniversary in 2017.
 
On January 6, we held the first of our two Free Introductions to square dancing before our winter lessons start. We had a nice group of new dancers, including two recent immigrants from Japan! There were smiles all around as the new dancers experienced our unique blend of square dance culture and Rambler hospitality. We look forward to a big Mainstream class this winter.
 
On February 6, we will be back at the Milwaukie Grange, with Chuck Garner calling. Chuck taught many of us to dance, so it‚Äôs always a treat to welcome him ‚Äúhome‚Äù and show him how well our dancing is progressing. We warmly invite all dancers‚Ä&rdquo;singles are especially welcome at the Ramblers‚Ä&rdquo;to enjoy a potluck dinner from 6-7 and alternating Mainstream and Plus tips from 7-9:30. We don‚Äôt include round dancing in our program, so if you are purely a square dancer, we will keep you on your feet all night!
 
SYIAS!
