December flew by so fast this year.  Such a wet one but kept thinking it’s all to keep our beautiful state green, year round.  Hope you all had a great Christmas and danced in the New Year.

Our first dance of January came on the 1st.  What a fun way to dance in 2016.  It was our Black and Blue Ball, dancing until you drop marathon with all singing calls.  A few of us did drop but had a great time while doing it.  Thanks KC and Bev for making it a fun time for all.  

January 3rd was the start for our Round Dance lessons at our Kinton Grange, with Bev and Harlan Flint.  Those two make everything fun.  Lessons are from 2 to 4 p.m.  Come and join in on the fun learning the Two Step and Waltz.  KC and Linda resumed mainstream lessons on Wednesday nights at our grange on January 6th from 7 to 9 p.m.  We have had some great new beginners that have brought in laughter and new friendships.

We hope to see you in a square at Mid-Winter Festival and back home to the Kinton Grange for our Sadie Hawkins Dance on February 5th.  Come and join us for a southern style dinner before the dance.  All are welcome and we are looking forward to seeing some fun costumes.  It’s your time to shine.
