December was a busy month for everyone and especially our dancers. Our club members took part in the community "Holidays In the Park" at Ralson Park in Lebanon.   Our lighting display was awarded first place for Best of Theme with a beautiful trophy.  Our Toy Dance/ New Dancers Dance was super.   

Lessons are moving right along and our students will graduate on January 17 following the Lebanon Square Circlers 67th Birthday Dance. Our club is the second oldest club in Oregon. We hope lots of dancers will be there to help us celebrate this birthday.  Charlotte Jeskey will be calling with guest caller Jim Voll and Jackie Gale will be cueing.  Strawberry shortcake will be served at the break.  

Our club members celebrated New Years Eve in Corvallis. The Alliance clubs (Albany, Corvallis, Lebanon, and Sweet Home) have a New Yearâ€™s dance each year with the clubs taking turns hosting. Great way to greet 2016. See you in a square!   Marilyn York
