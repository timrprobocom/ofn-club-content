As 2015 ends, we look forward to 2016 and Mid-Winter Festival. We have seven students in our new dancerâ€™s class who will graduate shortly before the Festival and we are encouraging them to attend. They have been attending area New Dancer Dances.

Our Christmas/New Dancer Dance was very well attended. Six squares on the floor with visitors from many area clubs. Lots of fun!  Also, lots of experienced clothing was sold. 

Happy New Year. See you at Mid-Winter. Carmen Rost
