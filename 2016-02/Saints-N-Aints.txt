We had a very successful New Year’s Dance.  Many people came in pirate costumes and the food was fabulous. For example -Fish & Chips (goldfish crackers & potato chips), Sea Slugs (bacon wrapped mini-sausages), Peg Legs (corn dogs), cupcakes with skull & crossbones frosting, and Tony Lewis, our President’s (Crystal) husband, baked a cake decorated with a pirate ship.

Our Plus class has ended but Round Dance Lessons have begun with Donna Hiserote teaching waltz.
