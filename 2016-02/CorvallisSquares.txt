By the time this is reported, Mid Winter Festival will be behind us, and we hope that all had an enjoyable time there! 

February is very special for our club as it is the month of our Birthday Dance, on February 13! The wonderful wooden dance floor at our regular dance hall, First Congregational Church, has been refinished and is ready for dancing.

Thanks to all who have hosted the New Dancers' dances; they've been a lot of fun! 

We're looking forward to our coast trip March 11-13 at Gleneden Beach Community Club, and all are welcome! We're dancing there both Friday and Saturday nights. Karen Karplus
