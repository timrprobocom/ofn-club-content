Christina and Kirby hosted a party at their home in December for the Spin Cycle Squares.  It was a lot of fun to get together away from the dance hall and also to see dancers that can no longer dance.  We also had one non-dancer in the mix, and it's looks like she's itching to give square dancing a try.

Tim Matteson, our caller, had a gathering of his own at his home in Springfield.  Tim had an amazing Playmobile set up for our enjoyment and amazement.  Last year Tim had a different Playmobile set up which entranced us all.  He's got thousands upon thousands of pieces that he puts together to make almost anything.  This year the theme was 'Winter" with a hockey rink, spectators, vendors, you name it!  Amazing!

Sally Brown dances with us and also takes care of the used clothing area.  She has done amazing and innovative things to bring in money for the hall each month.  One Sunday, hours before our dance, Sally primed and painted the panels surrounding the used clothing area.  She even danced a couple of tips with us before heading home to crash.  The used clothing area looks pristine and is a beautiful backdrop for clothing that she displays.  Thank you Sally for all your hard work and ingenuity. 

We continue to dance all levels from 5:30 - 8:00 most Sundays in Hall A at the hall in Sprngfield.  We encourage you to join us.  Please call Tim at 541-988-0399 or our president, David at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are dancing.  We rarely go dark, but you never know. 

We do look forward to having Kris Jensen, national caller from Albuquerque, back with us in March. 
 
Happy dancing!
