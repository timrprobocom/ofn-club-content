R Square D has had a fun filled December, starting with 24 members attending the Cougars Thankful Christmas Dance.  What a great time we had although we missed have Jim Raupp doing the calling because of illness.  Craig Abercrombie was the caller for the evening and Susan Healea was the cuer.  They both did a good job of keeping the evening fun and lively.  R Square D was presented with a traveling guitar.

On December 11th we had our Christmas Toy dance. We had visitors from Happy Hoppers, Cougars, Prairie Steppers and Fairway Village.  Craig and Lonnie did the calling and cuing for the evening.  Toys were collected and donated to the Salvation Army,

Our annual Christmas dinner, meeting and Christmas party was on December 14th. The food was excellent, the meeting short and the gift exchange was a lot of fun.  We were dark for our 4th Saturday dance which would have been December 26th.

On Friday, February 12th we will have our Valentine's dance, and on Saturday, February 27th will be our Dancing in the Rain Dance.
