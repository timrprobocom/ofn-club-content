Mainstream lessons started January 10th with the hopes of growing our club; we have lost several dancers over the recent past to people moving away, health problems, etc. So we need to get some new people to just keep the same number of members and hopefully then even increase our membership of the club.

Mainstream dances on February 6th and 20th.  The theme for these dances is “President’s Dances”.   Now that the holidays are over we hope you will come visit us, we have a lot of fun and we could have even more if you come visit us.

Plus dances will be on February 4th and 18th; we are getting a good turnout but would of course like to see more dancers.  Darrell Kalmbach is calling a great dance and Ken Pratt is doing a good job of cueing, too. 

Beginning the New Year it is time to get back to visiting other clubs and doing our lessons.  We hope the best for all the square dance clubs; we could sure use some new younger energetic members to revitalize the activity we love to do; maybe 2016 will start a new wave of dancers to help our clubs.  Thanks for the past memories; let’s continue to make some more good memories in the future.
