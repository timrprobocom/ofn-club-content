Our Christmas dance was a treat as always, with food for Oregon Food Bank piled on the stage.  Randy and Jeanine had a delightful selection of Christmas music for us to dance to, altogether a perfect evening.  

Thus far the weather hasnâ€™t interfered with dance attendance.  If forecasts change, do check our website, http://www.mixandminglesquares.org/ for the latest.
