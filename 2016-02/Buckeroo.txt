December started with our dance on the 5th.  It was called by our own Dale Roberson. As we spend time dancing with Dale, we are reminded how blessed we are to have had him as part of our club for so many years. The dance was well attended and everyone had a great time.

We invited our students to the Christmas dance held on the 19th. We had an amazing seven squares of dancers out on the floor.  It was so much fun to see and feel the excitement in the air. We even had a square of visitors who traveled down from Portland for the dance. The caller for the evening was Terry Halley who also traveled from the Portland area just to call our Christmas dance.

We are starting the New Year off with national caller Mike Sikorsky coming to the barn. He will be here on January 2, 2016. If you are in the area, join us for a night of great fun and dancing. This will be the first time that Mike has been to the Buckeroo Barn, but we are hoping it will not be his last!

We hope everyone gets to dance in the New Year!
