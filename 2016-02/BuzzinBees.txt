Greetings from the Buzzin' Bees. I hope everyone had a good holiday season.  I want to be the first to wish you a Happy Valentines Day and hope your month is filled with love in honor of valentine's day. We only have 1 dance in February and it is on 2/6/16.  It is our annual Pie Eating Contest.  It is great fun and if you are a fast eater you could win and have your name engraved on our plaque.  Of course there will be pie for the break. We are dark on 2/20 because the grange is rented to a clogging group that night so we will plan a visitation. 

Next month I'll let you know how it is going with our new lesson class and our new format for the first dance of the month.  We are starting a workshop for the first dance of the month. Come and work on anything giving you problems on the dance floor. Hope to see you in a square.
