Our annual Mardi Gras Ball will take place on February 19th.  Make sure to wear your best attire and your favorite mask!  Prizes will be given and a drawing will take place.  Make sure to purchase your drawing tickets for a chance to win $100.  The event will take place with rounds at 7:30 to 7:45 and Plus from 7:45 to 8:00.  Mainstream starts at 8:00 with every fourth tip plus.  We will have two callers at our Mardi Gras Ball.  The callers include our own, Terry Halley and Mike Halley!  Be ready for lots of fun and dancing the night away!

Tri Squares students are almost ready to graduate.  Terry Halley has been teaching mainstream lessons and Sandra Pinion has been teaching Two-Step.  We look forward to dancing with you at our Mardi Gras Ball and the month of February.
