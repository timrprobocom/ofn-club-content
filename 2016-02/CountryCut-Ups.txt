Arenâ€™t you glad you are a square dancer? We have so much fun, great friends, a safe place to exercise and socialize, and a wonderful community of support. We need to be promoting this great activity year round. There are many people in the community that donâ€™t even know about this treasure that sits right under their noses.

It is not too early to think about the annual Barn Sale, one of our major fund raisers for the year. If you are a Cut-Up, keep this in mind as you do your spring cleaning. If you are not a Cut-Up, we still accept donations, and keep in mind a place to find some real bargains. Date will be announced soon, but it is usually in April at the Boring Barn. We have also had a simple fund raiser for several months, about once a month at the Gresham Burgerville. Ask Kathie Femrite for the dates, and come out and help clean tables, serve food, and promote square dancing, or just come eat some dinner at the right time. A percentage of the profit goes to our club during these Wednesday night club service times. 

Spring also brings elections, so consider volunteering to run for a position in the club when the nominating committee comes around. We all have to do our part, by taking turns serving, as well as keeping up with door, kitchen, and housekeeping duties. Maybe you canâ€™t commit to a yearlong service as an officer, but you can help with a special event. Many hands make lighter work. Overall, we have a great club that steps up to get the job done â€&ldquo;thank you!
