<li><a>Jacque Talbert Obituary</a>
<div>
<p>
Jacque Norton-Talbert passed away on December 12, 2015 during a single-car 
accident in San Felipe, Mexico where she resided during the winter.
<p>
Jacque was born to David and Dona Henderson on February 8, 1948 in San Diego, 
California, and raised by her mother, Dona and step-father Clessen Mecham.
<p>
Jacque attended college at Southern Oregon University in Ashland where she
received her AA degree. After college she married John E Norton. John and
Jacque shared a love of music, car racing, the ocean and most importantly,
their two children Jonathan and Jennelle. In 1978, following her divorce,
Jacque and the children moved to Oregon as Jacque knew Bend was "the
place" to raise her children.
<p>
In 1984 Jacque married Jeffrey A Talbert. Together, Jacque and Jeff
made the kids their first priority. Jacque was a dedicated and involved
mother. In the early 80’s the family took an interest in BMX. It was
not uncommon on any given weekend for Jacque to load her Suburban with
bikes and kids (hers and others) to travel anywhere in the Northwest to
race. Jacque and her Suburban were legendary at the BMX tracks. Jacque
remained actively involved with High Desert BMX in Bend and Smith Rock
BMX in Redmond volunteering her time and expertise until 2014.
<p>
She was a member of Mirror Court 24, Order of the Amaranth, in Bend
Oregon where she served as Royal Matron. Jacque truly enjoyed her Amaranth
service; she valued and cherished her Masonic friends and associates.
<p>
It was only natural, given her love of music and dancing, that Jacque
would become involved in Square and Round dancing. She was a member of
Bachelor Beauts and Sundown Rounds in Bend. She was an associate member
of SageBrush Shufflers in Prineville and the RedRocks in Redmond. She
could also be found dancing with the Swinging Mountaineers Plus club in
Bend. Jacque never joined any group without getting involved and being
of service. She was an officer of the Central Oregon Square and Round
Dance Council and chairman for the Central Oregon Roundup. Not only did
she love to dance she loved to design and modify dance costumes.
<p>
In 2014 Jacque purchased a second home in San Felipe, Mexico. Fixing
up the property and making it comfortable and inviting for family and
friends was her priority. The woman was not only talented but tireless.
<p>
Jacque ("Just Jacque", as she referred to herself) will be remembered for her
love and devotion to family and friends; her service to the community;
her tenacious spirit and zest for life. "Just Jacque" didn’t just
go through life she LIVED life, right to the end.
<p>
Jacque will be missed by all who knew and loved her. She is survived
by her son, Jonathan Norton and wife Kelli; daughter, Jennelle Norton
Vanderford; grandchildren, Jaxson, Milo, Kameryn, Iszabelle, and Austin;
sisters, Cheryl Crane, Jeri Barnes, Laurie Grauberger; brother, Michael
Mecham.
<p>
A celebration of her life is being planned after the holidays.

<li><a>Claire Enloe Obituary</a>
<div>
<p>
Claire Enloe was born in Clatskanie, the first child of three born to
Harold Edward Mattson and Iva Helen Waters Mattson.
<p>
Her paternal grandparents were immigrants from Finland and Norway and
lived on "the ranch" outside of town.  Claire and her family moved
to the big city if Portland when she was 10, after which she became a
"city girl".
<p>
Claire graduated from Washington High School in 1947 and soon after met
Bob Enloe.  Claire and Bob married Valentine’s Day Feb. 14,
1948, and were married 51 years before he passed in 1999.  Claire and
Bob raised two boys, Jay and Mark, in a home Bob built on a half-acre
on S.W. Taylor Street, out in the country of Washington County.
<p>
After the boys were grown, Claire and Bob built their next home on10
acres in Manning,  Claire and Bob went on to have three grandchildren,
Dalles, Charles, and Melody, and five great grandchildren, Trey, Jenna,
Savaan, Corben, Alexis, and Sabrina.
<p>
Claire was always focused on family, while also very ambitious outside
the home, working in a number of early jobs but ultimately becoming a
sales manager for Avon Products, through which she seemed to meet most of
Western Washington County.  Those she did not meet through Avon, she knew
from neighborhood, from being an early member of St. Andrew’s Lutheran
church and from many community activities -- including square dancing,
assisting with the polls at election time, starting and running the TOPS
club in Banks, quilting, and others.
<p>
On Bob’s passing, Claire moved back to "the city", to a new area of Hillsboro
that was just rising from the fields -- Orenco Station.  She very much enjoyed her condominium and continued her very social network, in Washington County, which had been her home since 1953.
<p>
Claire met her companion, Bill Young, several years after Bob’s passing
and after Bill had lost his wife of many years.  Claire and Bill enjoyed
six years of companionship together, including celebrating her 80th
birthday Easter Day in the Netherlands, Bill sadly passed away from
cancer illness less than two years later.  Bill’s children were a very
important part of Claire’s extended family.
<p>
Claire passed away peacefully in her sleep Dec. 10, 21015, from
complications of lung cancer, which was diagnosed in 2011.  She was
fortunate to have few symptoms, until the last four to six weeks when
weakness became significant and she moved to assisted care, where she
received excellent care.
<p>
A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 9, 2016, at
the Old Scotch Church, 30685 N.W. Scotch Church Road, Hillsboro, where
Claire and Bob had been members for many years. In lieu of flowers,
Claire would appreciate donations to the American Cancer Society, to
assist its anti-smoking programs.

<li><a>Cathy Bailey Obituary</a>
<div>

Catherine "Cathy" Jessie Bailey, 71, passed on December 30, 2015.
Cathy never like to shine a spotlight upon herself, but those
who knew her could not say enough about her.  And they are consistent in
how they describe her.  She’s a woman who possessed the biggest heart,
the warmest smile, with the most generous and giving spirit.  She’s a
woman filled with love for God and other people - a passionate supporter
of those in her life.  Cathy was a great example of faithful service
even in the midst of her own suffering.  She was an example of letting
her servant’s heart guide her journey.

<p>
Born to Farquhar and Ruth Stewart on November 10, 1944, she was the middle
child between Mike Stewart and little sister Judy Manos in northeast
Portland. Even from an early age, Cathy’s caring and serving heart
served her family well, and she often cared for her siblings when her
parents were both working hard to support the family.  Later, she raised
two children, John Martin and Teresa Portinga.  She was totally dedicated
to her children even as she was forced to overcome large obstacles such
as being a single parent and facing serious health issues.  She still
managed to provide for and love her children and serve all those around
her and in her church.

<p>
After her children were grown, she expanded her immediate family by
finding and marring her true love, her prince, Carson Bailey II and
gained two children, Dallas Bailey and Sue Angelechio.  After seven
grandchildren had arrived, her family was complete.  This addition to
her life allowed her to flourish and share great happiness and even more
love to all those around her.

<p>
Her servant’s heart continued as she dedicated herself to not only her
family and friends, but also to The Shrine and other clubs and programs
such as the children’s program at her church, a sewing group that
served the Shriner’s Children Hospital, and to absolutely anyone who
could use a smile, help or kind words.

<p>
We want to let her and you to know that she did an outstanding job here
and wish her a safe journey.  We will remember her smile, her warmth,
her grace, fun energy, and her love of life.  She gathered people who
loved her, dear friends, every step of her way.  She will never be
forgotten.  She worked very hard all her life, up until the very end.
She made a difference in the lives of many.  We invite you to join us
and celebrate together.

<p>
Cathy and Carson over the years were members of several square dance
clubs including the Checkerboard Squares in Portland, Hoedowners in
Aloha, and Sunset Promenaders in Hillsboro as they enjoyed many years
of dancing together.
