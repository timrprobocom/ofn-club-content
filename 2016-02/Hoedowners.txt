On Sunday, December 6th we kicked off the holly jolly season with our New Dancer Jamboree.  Daryl had quite a group join him on stage; Jim Hattrick, Mike Stout, Chuck Garner and K. C. Curtis.  Julie Stout joined Yvonne in cueing.  It was a wonderful opportunity for everyone to spend an afternoon on the dance floor and for the new dancers a chance to practice singing calls and hear new and different voices.  Thanks to the Aloha Grange for the beautifully decorated ballroom.

We held our Toyland Dance on the 12th and piled our donated toys under the Christmas tree.  We enjoyed dancing to holiday music and singing along; do you know the lyrics to Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer?  We finished the evening by joining hands and singing Silent Night before refreshments.  All the donated toys were delivered to the Toyota dealership where they were matched gift for gift. 

The Hoedowners contributed cash, gift cards, toys, apparel, and home goods to the Aloha Grange’s holiday adopted family.  It’s a wonderful tradition and a chance for our members to share our bounty.

Our Pajama Dance hit the spot coming just the day after Christmas.  Everyone relaxed in their pj’s and comfies. Dancing in slippers can be a challenge but everyone seemed to master the skill. We dined on breakfast food; bacon, sausage, pancakes, biscuits & gravy, eggs, a welcome change from the normal holiday fare.  

Many Hoedowners celebrated New Year’s Eve at the TVC dance but no matter where we were we anticipate another great year with our friends and families.  We wish everyone the blessing of contentment in 2016.

In February we hope to see you on the 13th for our Queen of Hearts dance.  On February 27th is our 66th Anniversary Dance!!  Where were you in February 1950?  We’ll be serving a chicken dinner at 6:15, 7-9 pm Mainstream with Plus from 9:10-10pm.
