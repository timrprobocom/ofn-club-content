<h3>Youth Activities</h3>
If you are a high school senior or college freshman and are planning on
continuing your education in a college or trade school, there are two
square dance scholarships to be aware of.   The United Square Dancers of
America (USDA) awards one $1,000 scholarship each year to a high school
senior who has been a member of a federated square dance club for at
least one year.  The completed application form is due by February 1,
2016.  The application and guidelines can be found on their website at:
<a href="http://www.usda.org/youth.htm">http://www.usda.org/youth.htm</a>.
All applications must be accompanied by a Nomination Form signed by 
OFSRDC President Kay Rogers.

The second scholarship is from the OFSRDC (Oregon Federation of Square
and Round Dance Clubs) and is available for all high school seniors and
college freshmen who have been a member of a federated square dance club
for at least one year and are going to continue with their education.
The OFSRDC scholarship is $500, and applications are due May 1,
2016. The application and guidelines are on the OFRSDC website at
