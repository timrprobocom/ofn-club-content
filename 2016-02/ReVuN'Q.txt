We had a most excellent New Yearâ€™s Eve dance with over 17 couples in attendance. We danced phase 3-4 and some phase 5. Lots of food was served on two tables. We had noise makers, hats, leis, and sparkling cider to bring in the New Year. As president, I want to thank the membership and the guests for a fun night of friendship, music and food. David Vomocil (Kathy) assisted our cuer Cheryl Manley (Geof) in cueing some great music and working on the request list that grew longer as the night went on. Hopefully we can do it again this year. I have already asked for the hall for the evening.

We, as a group, are working on a Showcase for Mid-Winter and will spend January working on our styling. Our cuer, Cheryl Manley, is doing the choreography and it should be fun. 

We will start on a new rhythm as soon as we make a decision as to what it will be. We are looking at some tango workshops over the summer to keep us busy before the fall season begins. Marilyn Schmit
