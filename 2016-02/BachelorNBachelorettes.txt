We always have great dances, particularly this Feb 10th when we have our Valentine’s Dance. We’re hoping our cute half-naked cherub will again visit us with his little bow and arrow. I’m really going to flirt with him this year. Or should I dance with my regular partner? Remember, between two evils, pick the one you haven’t tried before.

If you can’t make it Feb 10, Leonard Snodgrass will be calling Feb 17.  He doesn’t come up here a whole lot, so it’s a special treat when he can be enticed to call for us.
