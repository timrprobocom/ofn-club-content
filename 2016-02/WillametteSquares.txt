Willamette Squares went dark for the month of December resumed its normal schedule in January, dancing every fourth Saturday of the month at the Salem Square Dance Center.

We met for a club meeting on December 20 and among the topics discussed was the afternoon New Dancer Dance which we would have been hosting in the new year on January 3 at the Salem Square Dance Center. However, due to unanticipated snowfall and a forecast of freezing rain, we thought it best in the interest of safety to postpone the dance until further notice when we can count on the weather to be more co-operative. Also in the works is planning our next visitation. 

We anticipate Two Step lessons will conclude by the end of January, followed by waltz lessons to begin in February. We are hoping for the year 2016 to be one of much square and round dancing. Happy New Year to all the clubs from Willamette Squares!
