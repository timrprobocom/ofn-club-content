For a number of years the Dancing Friends have not done much more than have their yearly Birthday dance. Starting last October 2015 they started having classes on the first and third Wednesdays of the month. We begin the class with a half hour of mixed level rounds, progress to an hour of teaching, and finish with another half hour of mixed level rounds. We hope to give intermediate dancers a place to dance, while introducing new dancers to the activity. Neil Koozer is the instructor.
