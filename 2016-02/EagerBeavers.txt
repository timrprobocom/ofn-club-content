Somehow winter seems shorter when February comes around even if it does have 29 days in 2016.  Besides, it also has Valentine’s Day and a holiday, Presidents’ Day. 

This February is special for us because we begin our Plus Class which welcomes students starting on Monday, February 15th from noon to 2:00 pm.    Classes are only $4 each and we have three top instructors: Jim Hattrick - 3rd Mondays, Darrell Kalmbach - 2nd & 4th Mondays, and Daryl Clendenin - 1st & 5th Mondays.  There will be a fifteen minute break at 1:15.  At 1:30 students will have the opportunity to dance two tips with the club using what they have just learned. This is the best opportunity ever for moving to the plus level or even honing your plus dancing skills  Call Marie 503-645-0730 or Sally 503-645-2414 for more information and to sign up.  See our flyer in this issue.

We will have our annual King and Queen of Hearts Dance on February 8th. Our royalty is chosen by luck of the draw so you may win the chance to be the ruler for a while. Wear your heart on your sleeve and a smile on your face.  Everyone loves a lover.

We dance on holidays.  Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons: Rounds 1:00 - 1:30 (Rounds will start at 1:15 during lessons); Plus 1:30 - 3:15 PM, Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.  We dance on holidays too so if you have a day off come join us.
