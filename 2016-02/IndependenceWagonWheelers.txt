The first dance of the year was fun with two squares dancing. Daryl Clendenin was calling and Ralph Lambert was cueing.  January 9 was our regular dance with George and Ralph.

On a more exciting note, we have a very special dance coming up on February 13, 2016. IWW will be hosting a “MARDI GRAS DANCE”. George will be calling and Ralph cueing. Costumes are appreciated, with square dance attire welcome. All dancers are welcome. Come join the fun with IWW at the “MARDI GRAS”.

On April 9, IWW presents Dan Nordbye. This is our regular dance night and we welcome everyone to come enjoy the calling of a National caller. See you there.
IWW will be dancing on our regular second and third Saturdays until August, so come visit with us. We would like to see you. Sandy Eddings
