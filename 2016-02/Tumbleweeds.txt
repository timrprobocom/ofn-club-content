Tumbleweeds ended 2015 with a visitation from River City Dancers and began the New Year 2016 with a Pajama Dance. We will be having a Valentine Dance on Feb 12th and Easter Dance on March 25th. We dance every Friday 11am-2pm. We will be Dark for Mid-Winter Festival on the 29th of January. Hope to see you in Tumbleweeds Square soon.
