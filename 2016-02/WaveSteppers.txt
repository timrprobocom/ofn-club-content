The Wave Steppers’ first dance of the 2016 season will be the St. Patrick’s Dance Saturday, March 12th, with club caller Joe Wrabek and line dance instructor Gwen Kiel.  This is Crab Races Weekend, so if you need to book a hotel room or RV space, you should do it well in advance.

Joe and Gwen will also be sharing the bill at the club’s Spring Fling Dance Saturday, May 14th, the Western Dance Saturday, June 11th, and the Fall Dance Saturday, October 8th.

We have out-of-town callers at the club’s other 2016 dances: Jim Hattrick will be calling and cueing our “Jim Hattrick Dance” Saturday, April 9th; Harvey Hunsucker will call and cue the Beach-Themed Dance Saturday, July 9th; we’ll have caller Darrell Kalmbach and cuer Connie Clark at the County Fair Dance Saturday, August 13th; and at the Elvis Dance Saturday, September 10th, it’ll be caller Mark Wheeler (as Elvis) with cuer Connie Clark.

All the dances are held on the Dance Floor at Garibaldi City Hall, 107 Sixth St. (at Acacia).  Two-thirds of the second floor of the building is a dance floor, built in the 1940s.  (The Dance Floor is handicapped-accessible.)

Square dance classes continue every Wednesday night at the Tillamook Elks lodge, 1907 Third St. in downtown Tillamook.  The classes are taught by caller Joe Wrabek, and are free.
