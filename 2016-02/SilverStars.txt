The Silver Stars continue our new dance program on 4th Fridays with Darrell Kalmbach as our club caller and Dorothy Lowder cueing.  Dancing begins with pre-rounds at 7 pm, plus at 7:30, and mainstream from 8-10pm at the Hazel Dell Grange in Vancouver.  We realize many of you may just be getting off work so don't worry about square dance clothes--JUST COME DANCE.

We are working on a visitation schedule so do not be surprised if we show up to your club.  Hope everyone made it through the winter unscathed and healthy.  See you in a square.  Yellow rocks to all.
