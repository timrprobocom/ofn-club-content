It pays to read the Oregon Federation News. You can find things such as the news that Vancouver's Columbia River Dancers have moved from the YMCA to the Hazel dell Grange. Yes, we have moved. Look for us at the Hazel Dell Grange!! The club gives a big "thank you" to the Vancouver YMCA for the use of their facilities our first year in existence. They were very gracious to us. However, we just could not overcome the lack of good acoustics for our dances and the difficult time our callers had seeing the floor. So, when the opportunity to move to the Grange came up, we took it. The time and dates are still the same, so look forward to seeing you on the second and fourth Saturdays. While we were making changes, we also changed our lesson night from Wednesday to Thursday. We will continue to start beginner classes the first Thursday of each month. This allows new students the opportunity to get two shots at lessons each week as we are cooperating with the Happy Hoppers on the sequence of calls learned. Jim Hattrick is teaching both groups, and we have seen great progress in those who attend both sessions.

Our February 13th dance will have Craig Abercrombie calling and cueing and our regular caller, Jim Hattrick, calling and cueing on the 27th. We dance plus from 7 PM to 8 and mainstream from 8-10. We encourage singles, couples and families to dance with us.

And speaking of Jim Hattrick, he will be continuing his "Plus and a little bit more" classes on Tuesdays evenings at the Grange. He does a workshop for intermediate round dancers at 6 PM and plus square dancers starting at 7. If you want to hone your skills, I encourage you to try it.

We will be having our 1st Anniversary dance on March 12th with Adam Christman as our featured caller and cuer. We are looking forward to another great year and would love to have you join us.
