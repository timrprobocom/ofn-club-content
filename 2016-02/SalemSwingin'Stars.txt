February is a normal month for us. We will dance on the first and third Friday of the month. 

Our 13 new dancers are off to a great start. We know that all those who attend the Mid Winter Festival will have a great time.

Save the date for Salem Swingin' Stars Tax Free Golden Anniversary Dance on April 15. More details and a flyer will be available later. See you all on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
