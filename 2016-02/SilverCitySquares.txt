Our December dance was a lot of fun for those who came. We also celebrated the 50th birthday of one of our club members (my father), Mathew Buchheit.

We had a demo at a Senior Center on December 19. We only had one square show up, but we were able to do a nice demo to Leonard's calling. They have asked us to come back again sometime.
 
We wish everyone a Happy New Year! Petrina Buchheit
