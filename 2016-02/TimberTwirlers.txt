Happy New Year, welcome to 2016. 2015 was a fun year with lots of great dancing, and I'm sure 2016 will be even better. Timber Twirlers will be starting mainstream square dance lessons in February so let your friends know. 
 
Feb 5 will be our Chocolate dance (yummy) and on the 19th we will celebrate Chinese New Yearâ€™s. Always something fun going on so come join us on the first and third Fridays at the IOOF, 738 SE 5th in Albany. Sandy Harris
