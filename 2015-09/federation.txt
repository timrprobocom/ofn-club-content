The Interstate Highlander Council thanks everyone who participated in
the  2015 Summer Festival. We appreciate your support. Those of you who
missed it really did miss a good time. Our final report will be ready by
the September State meeting. Although we didn't get as large a turn out
as we hoped we should have enough to pay all the bills and run a good
recruitment this Fall. All lost and found items have been distributed
except for a hand towel and sunglasses. If you left these items please
contact us so we can return them to you.

The September Federation meeting will be held at the Milwaukie Community
Center the weekend of September 19 and 20.  Come join the PAC and the
River City Dancers as they host a
