Summer is almost over and it seems to go by faster each year. Soon classes will start and we hope that everyone has a good turnout of new students. Our local newspaper had a nice article on square dancing with a list of classes in our area. 

Our club, along with Sets-in-Order, danced at the Coos County Fair in July and plan on being in the Fun Fest Parade the third weekend in September.  

Don&rsquo;t forget Battle Rock dance Labor Day weekend in Port Orford!
