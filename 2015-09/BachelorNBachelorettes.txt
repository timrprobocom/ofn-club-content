July 15 was the memorable night we crept into the Abernethy Grange. (We didn&rsquo;t get to dance the week before.) We stole softly upstairs, rounded the corner and poked our heads through the twin doors. There was a gasp!  Not a dust bunny was in sight! The floors were gleaming, yearningly invoking us to enter and look some more. With a sudden stampede we were inside. The music began, and we broke into our happy dance on the newly refinished floor!

We get a lot of visitors, but only once in a blue moon do we get an actual club visitation.  July was a blue moon month, and the Rosetown Ramblers and Heads to the Center gave us a visitation.  Our common denominator is that all three of our clubs are particularly oriented to the solo dancer.  Yes, many of us are coupled up, but we&rsquo;ve always been oriented towards the solo dancer.  It is seldom the Ramblers can visit us, as they have their lessons on our dance nights.

Our Mike Sikorsky dance, Aug 5, was also our annual luau dance.  And, oh, could we flounce the grass skirts!  Club Auditor Buck Cashout says 101 dancers packed our gleaming floor.

We&rsquo;re going to have our mainstream lessons starting Sept 22 at 7:PM.  Our waltz lessons will begin on SEP 23 at 6:30. See the lessons section of this magazine for more details.
