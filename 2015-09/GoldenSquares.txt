    The Golden Squares will start plus dance lessons on September 9, 1:30 to 3:30pm. in the club house auditorium. For information, call Gin 503-982-0448.
      We had our annual pajama dance and a good time was had by all. Randy and Gin presented a small skit following the dance.
      We also had our pie night and it was well attended by the other clubs in our area. 
Our next regular dance will be held on Sept. 21. Dolly
