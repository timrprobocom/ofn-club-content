The Wave Steppers&rsquo; September dance on the 12th will feature Darrell Kalmbach calling, with line dance instructor Gwen Kiel.  It won&rsquo;t be the last dance of the year, though; the Wave Steppers will be having an October as well as a Christmas dance, date not certain yet, at the Tillamook Elks Lodge where we&rsquo;ve been having our square dance classes.
 In 2016, the club&rsquo;s monthly dance schedule will start in March; our first dance will be the second Saturday in March on the 12th.  That&rsquo;s the same weekend as the famous Garibaldi Crab Races.  After that, we&rsquo;ll have dances the second Saturday of the month in April, May, June, July, August, September, and October.  The March, April, May, September and October dances are tentatively scheduled to be called by club caller Joe Wrabek.
 The wave Steppers&rsquo; monthly dances are held at Garibaldi City Hall.  Most of the second floor of the building is a dance floor, built by the Fire Department in the 1940's for the old Firemen&rsquo;s Balls.  The Garibaldi square dance club, which has been in business at least since around 1900, has danced there ever since the dance floor was built.  The Garibaldi Inn and Suites, located half a block away, offers discounts for dancers spending the night.  Please visit our webpage for up to date information, www.wavesteppers.org.
