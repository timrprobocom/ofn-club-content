Summer has been fairly quiet for us with just a club meeting. Planning for lessons is going on with our lessons starting on September 8.
     We are dancing in the Homer Davenport Parade again in August. There is a big difference for us from the last couple of years as we do not have a trailer this year. We are square dancing the parade on foot and Leonard has to come up with some choreography to be able to do that. Most of our adults and youth guys are not joining us for this, so we will be having a square of mostly youth girls. Mom has told three of us girls that we will be guys for the parade and to dress for the boy positions. Petrina Buchheit
