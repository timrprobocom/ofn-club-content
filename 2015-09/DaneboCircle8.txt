We are dark September 5 as that is Labor Day weekend.  We look forward to a new dance season with Roger Puztler as our caller.  Roger calls at least once a month.    We dance the first and third Saturdays in Hall A at Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.  AC and cushioned wood floors.
 
New classes will being October 6.  Please plan on bringing a friend or two.  Classes will be Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Roger Putzler is the teacher.  Having class twice a week is proving to help with retention and finishing earlier than usual.  People are really ready for Mid-Winter with this format.

Keep on Dancing!
