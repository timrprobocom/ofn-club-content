The Hayshakers are partnering with the Sunset Promemaders to host the Seaside Sashay.  The Sashay will be held in Seaside at the Convention Center on October 16th and 17th.  Featured callers are Daryl Clendenin and Chuck Garner with Debbie Taylor cueing.  Advance discount tickets may be purchased from the Hayshakers and the Sunset Promenaders or you can sign up using the registration form on the flyer.  The flyer also has details of the dancing schedule.  This year the Sashay is being held on the 3rd weekend. Note that this is a change from the normal 4th weekend for this special annual event.  Weather permitting; we will be dancing at the turnaround on Saturday morning.
