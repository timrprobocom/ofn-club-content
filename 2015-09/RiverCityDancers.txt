River City Dancers, River City Riders and BnB&rsquo;s (Bachelor & Bachelorettes) were honored to host Stan and Norma Craig&rsquo;s sixtieth wedding anniversary last June 21st.  We knew Norma was very ill, but she arrived with big smiles and visited with everyone, even dancing several rounds with Stan.  Many thanks to Jolene and Ed Cummings for spearheading the event!  To use one of Jolene&rsquo;s favorite expressions, it was &ldquo;awesome&rdquo;.  

We lost Norma July 29th.  She was a classy, smart lady, serious but fun.  She and Stan had danced since 1958.  Goodbye, Norma!  We will miss you!  

I hear that fifteen River City Dancers attended Summer Festival in Klamath Falls during our usual third Saturday dance night, which we had cancelled.  Rocky and I had some personal conflicts and weren&rsquo;t able to attend, but we heard it was lots of fun.  It just shows that a smallish but organized group can put on a great party.

River City Riders have been actively performing all over where there&rsquo;s square dancing, winning high praise from all who are lucky enough to encounter them.

Anyone who knows a &ldquo;Rider&rdquo; realizes the immense amount of time and dedication they devote to their activity.  

The end of July brought River City&rsquo;s annual campout to Lone Fir Resort in Cougar, Washington.  Penny and Larry Crow spearheaded a beautiful weekend -- not so steamy and hot, for a change.  Then on Sunday, instead of heading home, Rocky, Chino (Rocky&rsquo;s little Chihuahua) and I went North, to Mt. Rainier.  The first day at Paradise Point was so foggy, we could&rsquo;ve been at Seaside or Cannon Beach and not have known the difference, but the second day we were treated to a fabulous view of the great mountain while hiking around Box Canyon.

We&rsquo;re looking forward to an uninterrupted month of dancing in August.  Remember, we&rsquo;re casual till the weather cools.  See you in a square at 42nd & Jackson, Milwaukie, second and third Saturdays; Les and Paula Seeley; Tami Helms & Kim Keck, our Cuer couple.
