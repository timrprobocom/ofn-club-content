Ever dance on pulverized rubber?  Introduce tiny bits of rubber to a tennis court, add music, a caller and you have dancing!  We joined the Valley River Dancers in Newberg at their &ldquo;Dancing Under the Stars&rdquo; event on 7/24/15.  So many clubs turned out to dance on a perfect weather night - who could ask for more.  Much thanks to Randy Dibble (fun to visit with you too, Sharon) and Julie Stiers for a fun night.

Oaky Doaks hosted their Birthday dance on August 1st, with a special return by Mike Halley as Caller, on stage for the first time since his cancer surgery in June.  You showed great stamina Mike - it was a great dance to be celebrating.

We will host Mainstream new-dancer lessons beginning Sundays, Sept. 13th, at the Maplewood Grange.  The first two Sundays, Sept. 13 and Sept. 20 are free and Scott Zinser will teach from 6:00 - 8:00 pm.  Angels are greatly appreciated AND dance for free.  Should your Club not offer MS lessons this year, we hope you bring your students, help them through the lessons and introduce them to your Club as "new MS dancers."

Chaps & Petticoats have been dark for the summer and will resume our 1st and 3rd Friday dances beginning Sept.18th, with a Patriotic theme for National POW/MIA Recognition Day, hosting Mike and Helen Halley for your dancing pleasure...we hope you come join us.

Happy Feet,
