The Toe&rsquo;s started July with a bang.  KC&rsquo;s and the USA&rsquo;s birthdays together on a warm night with an excellent BBQ and fun dance combined.  Kudos to the Toe Dragger&rsquo;s for providing a great dance on July 17th for the folks that couldn&rsquo;t make it to summer festival.  Mark Wheeler stepped in for KC.  Have you ever danced a Conga line, ending up in your own square?  It was fun.  Thanks to both Mark and Bev.  Speaking of Summer Festival….  Congratulations to Peggy and Bill Hults for helping to win, the Last Square Dance Standing Contest. 
 Japan here we come to finish out our year&rsquo;s world tour.  Come and visit us in August. 
 Our Anniversary dance is set for September 4th and lessons beginning on Wednesday evenings, September 9th.  We expect to see Pink, Pink and more Pink on Saturday September 12th for our special dance, Man Enough to Wear Pink Dance.  Fun, food, laughter and a raffle of baskets, all to help support the Susan G. Komen Foundation for Breast Cancer Research.  Bev Flint our cuer has put forth a challenge to KC.  She states she will try to have more cuers, cueing than callers, calling, at the dance. The dance is from 1 to 4 p.m.
