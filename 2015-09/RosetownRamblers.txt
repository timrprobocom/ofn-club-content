In July, 15 Ramblers traveled to the Abernethy Grange for a visitation to the Bachelors and Bachelorettes. Les Seeley kept us on our toes&mdash;as we used to say another century, that man is a caution! The Ramblers took home a banner and many happy memories. We thank the BnB&rsquo;s for their warm welcome and hospitality.
 
Back on home turf, we hosted our second annual ice cream social and free taste of square dancing on August 1. Ice cream was a good choice of refreshment, since that Saturday was the last in a long series of scorching days&mdash;and we were all wilting by the end of the evening. Still, we welcomed several brand-new dancers, and many other dancers visiting the Ramblers for the first time. Richard Lane amused and challenged the greenhorns and the old masters alike. Thanks to all for supporting our club!
 
We are looking forward to a busy fall, with the following events on our calendar:
<ul>
<li>       September 9: Free introduction to square dancing. This is a chance for new dancers to get a taste of what square dancing is all about and see if they might want to join us for lessons. We dance every Wednesday at the Ankeny Street Studio, 975 SE Sandy Blvd., 7-9 pm.
<li>       September 12: Saturday dance. Just for September, we&rsquo;ve moved our Saturday dance to the second Saturday to avoid a conflict with travel plans for Labor Day weekend. We&rsquo;ll be at the Milwaukie Grange, with Scott Amspoker (Albuquerque) calling.
<li>       October 23-25: A full weekend of dancing at the Multnomah Arts Center, 7688 SW Capitol Highway, Portland. We will have three top-notch callers (Mike Desisto, Chris Phillips (South Florida), and Gary Monday) and dance from Mainstream through C1.

We welcome one and all to join us for high-energy dancing in a friendly environment.
 
SYIAS!
