The Silver Stars have been busy this summer visiting summer festivals and weekend events, as well as visiting clubs that have danced all summer.  It has been a long, hot summer but if you pace yourself in the heat, an enjoyable time can be had by all--even if it is more visiting than dancing.  

We will begin our new dance year on September  12, 2015 with an "Apples Galore" theme dance.  Chuck Garner will be calling this dance for us and Dorothy Lowder cueing.  We dance at the Hazel Dell Grange with plus from 7 - 8 pm and mainstream dancing from 8 - 10 pm.  Hope you will come visit us.  Our 4th Saturday dance on the 26th is cancelled, due to a clogging weekend, however we are having a mystery trip--who knows we may visit you.  Our fall schedule is filled with Chuck Garner on 2nd Saturdays, and Darrell Kalmbach calling 4th Saturdays.  Dorothy is our club cuer,and does her usual terrific job of keeping the round dance full and entertaining.

Hope you and yours have a fantastic fall season and Happy Dancing.  Yellow rocks to all.
