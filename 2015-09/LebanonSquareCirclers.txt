Summer is quickly flying by, but it seems like only yesterday that the Lebanon club celebrated its 66th Annual Strawberry Festival Dances and Weekend. It all began on Thursday evening, June 4 when we gathered to have a potluck and decorate the float for the parade on Saturday morning. The theme this year was "Strawberry All Stars".  Randi Baker had created red, white, and blue streamer stars to be attached to the float along with our strawberry dancers. On Friday the Senior Center hall was decorated, RV's arrived, and there was another potluck prior to the Trails End Dance that evening with callers and cuers from the floor. Saturday was highlighted by the parade and the Festival Dance in the evening. Randy Dibble called and Jackie Gale cued. It was a glorious dance with visitors from over 12 different clubs and also from a Toe Draggers Mystery trip. Of course, strawberry shortcake was served at the break time. We had a truly successful Silent Auction, chaired by Kaynor Heineck, and an Experienced Clothing Sale, chaired by Marianne Cawrse. The weekend was climaxed with an "all-you-can eat" pancake breakfast on Sunday. All in all, it was a dynamite celebration. 
      On June 28, Nick and Kaynor Heineck hosted a garden and croquet party/potluck at their home followed by our June club meeting. It was great fun. On August 8, club members did their annual "Clean-up" of the IOOF facility as a part of the club responsibility for dancing there. 
      Bill and Charlotte Jeskey have invited square dancers to their home for a party/potluck, fun and games on Sunday, August 23. Also, our club will be gathering at Frank and Marianne Cawrse's farm over Labor Day weekend. 
     Our club has scheduled its mainstream classes to begin on September 20 at 6:30 PM at the IOOF Hall. Plus and A1 will also begin on that Sunday: Plus at 3:00 PM and A1 at 4:30 PM. Charlotte Jeskey will be the instructor. See you in a square! Marilyn
