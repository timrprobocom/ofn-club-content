The Corvallis Squares has had opportunities for a couple of demo dances to raise awareness of square dancing and to show how much fun we have. We danced at the Benton County Fair on a super hot day, and Roger Putzler called. In September we plan to dance at the Farmer's Market and at the Corvallis Fall Festival. 
      Our lessons will start on Monday evenings, beginning Sept. 28. Bruce Lowther will instruct our class. 
      Our club enjoyed a potluck and meeting at the Hendersons' in August, as we met and geared up for the fall. Our new presidents, Ken and Betty Iverson, are at the helm. We look forward to kicking off the dance season on Sept. 12!  Karen
