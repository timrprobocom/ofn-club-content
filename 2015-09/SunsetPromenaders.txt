In August we had our Luau Mainstream Dance, our Club Picnic at the Noble Woods Park, and Promenaders Plus with guest cuer Tami Helms.  Thank goodness for air conditioning; we have had a hot summer this year.
 September 5th is our &ldquo;School Supplies Drive Dance&rdquo;; please bring some school supplies and we will get them to the schools.
 Remember we dance Plus on the first and third Thursdays and Mainstream on the first and third Saturdays of the month.
 September 10th through the 12th we are having our Annual Club Beach Campout at Lincoln City Devils&rsquo; Lake RV Resort.  This is always a special time for the whole family; with games, puzzles, cards, walks, food, dancing, and maybe going to the casino, too.
 Be sure to not forget the Sunset Promenaders 30th Anniversary Dinner and Dance on October 3rd.  We plan on a ham dinner at 6:30, and the dance will start about 7:30 until 10:00 with a dessert break after the dance.  We are happy to have Dan Preedy from Spokane, a national caller, doing the calling and Ken Pratt will be cueing for us.  We are now selling tickets, so get yours before we run out; we only have room for so many dancers.
