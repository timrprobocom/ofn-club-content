Here we are, almost at the start of the new dance season. Hope everyone had a great summer. Timber Twirlers will be dancing once again at the IOOF hall in Albany. We are still looking for another permanent hall but the IOOF has great floors so I know you will enjoy dancing there again. 
      We start our mainstream lessons September 22, Tuesday nights at 7:00 to 8:45 with Bruce Lowther as the caller/instructor. We dance every first and third Fridays. Come join us for our first dance Sept 18. Sandy
