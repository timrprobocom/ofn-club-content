Our past president, Laura, is moving back to Washington State. We will miss her & her dedication to the club! Fred Muir stepped up after the announcement of Laura's impending relocation to resume the president position. 

After a summer of travelling to festivals around the state, including Summer Festival in Klamath Falls & Diamond Lake, we are looking forward to plus dances starting up again this September at the Barn. The Timber 8's will be only dancing once a month this coming year & are aiming for the 2nd Saturdays, but it may not always be that week. Please check our calendar (umpquaareasquaredancers.org/calendar) or Facebook page (facebook.com/RoseburgSquareDance) often to find out if our plus dance is on the 2nd or the 4th Saturday of the month.

We will also be starting plus lessons with caller Don Marshall on Tuesdays this autumn. Join us from 7-9p beginning 9/22 to learn or brush up on plus, or to be an angel for plus students! Reach out to us via Facebook or email at RoseburgSquareDance@gmail.com if you have any questions.
