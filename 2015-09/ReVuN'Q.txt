The club has finished mambo and is now working through six weeks of Bolero workshops to update moves that we slack off when dancing.
      The North Pole Irregulars (was supposed to be Misfits) made an appearance at Summer Festival Round Dance showcase. We enjoyed our performance and dressed silly to go with it. 
      We are contemplating our fall lesson plan and will post it as soon as we make a decision. Stay tuned. We have also completed the 90 day review for our new instructor, Cheryl Manley. She is doing well.
      We hope you will take some time to join us on Thursdays at 6:30 for dancing, 7:30 for lessons, and 8:30 for more dancing. This schedule seems to be working for the majority of those dancers who attend our club. Marilyn Schmit
