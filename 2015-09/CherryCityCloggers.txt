The Cherry City Cloggers and the Rhythm Rockers have been very busy. You may have seen us at World Beat, County fairs, or having lots of fun at dance night. We have our general meeting shortly and will have new officers. After the meeting, we are headed to Keizer River Festival. 
     We are looking forward to classes starting the second week in Sept. We have a nice list of in-coming new members. The Clog Hoppers are doing great. We are learning new songs now and then and having fun dancing the ones we know. Some of us are looking forward to the trip to Tacoma for the big event there. The Kick Off is in its 26th (?) year. Our amazing instructors will be teaching dance numbers and we will have three days of great dancing from beginner to advanced. We will be double toe dancing. Double Toe Stomp, Joanie
    Note: I am looking for any of the other dancers that went in 1978 with Marty and Gloria Firstenburg to Wizard Island, in Crater Lake. There were about 10 of us who got a permit to go to the island and dance on the dock. At that time, it was not open to the public. I hope there are a few of them reading this. I would like to get as many as we can to do a reunion. meeting at Diamond Lake Festival and then doing a return trip to the island. I know there have been other groups going to the island to dance, but these 10 people were the first to dance on the island in 1978. Anyone out there please let me know as it would be great for a 40 year reunion. Marty and Gloria will be missed, but maybe we can find a caller who might do the calling for us. Joanie
