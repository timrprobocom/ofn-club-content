      Our club went dark in July so members could attend Summer Festival in Klamath Falls. We hope everyone continues to support these festivals so we can continue to enjoy them. 
      We dance all summer and are doing demos to promote Fall classes. We are looking forward to dancing at the State Fair and celebrating National Square Dance month in September. We hope to see you in a square soon. Carmen
