Deep summer is when laziness finds respectability. 
 R Square D dancers celebrated the greatness of America with a Freedom dance on July 8th.  We followed it up with our &ldquo;let&rsquo;s all wear jeans&rdquo; denim dance on the 22nd.  We had visitors from Happy Hoppers, Harbor Haylofters, Flutter Wheels and Cougar Squares kicking it up in a rousing evening of dancing. 
 Our thanks go to Dale and Arlene Evanson for hosting the monthly meeting.  
September, and the ending to a long beautiful summer, finds us gearing up for new lessons, new friends and fun times together.  We kick off the month with a dance on September 1st, Boxcar Car Boogie & Chili feed and on the 26th we have our Autumn Leaves Dance.
