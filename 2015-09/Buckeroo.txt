If you were listening, you might have heard the pitter patter of feet hopping into their cars and heading out of Roseburg to dance at the Summer Festival  in Klamath Falls and the Diamond Lake Festival this month.  Those of us that danced at the Festivals had a great time dancing and visiting with out of town friends.  We went dark for the month of July so our dancers could travel to both festivals.

For the first time ever in July, we held a Barn sale which coincided with our local Graffiti Week End in Roseburg.  A few graffiti cars were seen in our parking lot scoping out our great buys and second hand treasurers.

Sadly for some of us, summer will soon be winding down, fall will be here, and like so many other clubs it will be time for the big push for lessons.  Our mainstream lessons will begin Sept. 14th (taught by Chuck Simpkins) which will a change for us from Tuesday to Monday evenings.  What a fun way to start out the work week, right? (Work week?  What&rsquo;s that? Yes, for some of us that&rsquo;s still our reality.)  A ten week session of round dance lessons will begin September 17th.  Neil will be teaching the waltz. Our Sept. 5th and Sept 19th dances will be casual attire...so feel free to wear your comfy clothes if you visit us in September!

Happy Dancing,
Rita Schuchard
