By the time you read this, the Milton-Freewater Muddy Frogs will have hosted a dance at Yantis Park in Milton-Freewater on August 16 and a 2018 Washington State Festival meeting, Blue Mountain Council meeting, dance and barbeque on August 29, also at Yantis Park.

Our September activities include dancing on our float in the Walla Walla Fair & Frontier Days parade on

Saturday, the 5th, and  sponsoring the Wallowa Mountain Rendezvous at Wallowa Lake near Joseph, OR  the weekend of the 11th to 13th.  Bill and Neva Reid will be calling and cueing both events, with Roger Putzler being a featured caller at the Rendezvous.  If you have never attended the Rendezvous, you have missed a great time, with lots of atmosphere provided by the building in which we dance.  It was built in 1918 and is probably like nowhere you have ever danced before!  Those of you who have danced there know what I mean!  The lake setting is fabulous to boot.  Wallowa Lake is one of the premier vacation spots in Oregon.  Hope to see you there!

For the love of square dancing,

Barbara Walter
