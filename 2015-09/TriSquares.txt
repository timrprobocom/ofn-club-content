During the month of August, we enjoyed our annual club picnic.  The picnic was held at Snyder Park in Sherwood.  Our picnic included a sing-a-long including a guitar and banjo! It was a great time for all members to have fellowship and fun.
 Round Dance lessons will begin September 20th at 2PM to 3:15PM. We will be learning the 2-Step.  Our cuer instructor is Sandra Pinion. Square dance lessons will be following the round dance lessons from 3:30PM to 5:30PM.  Terry Halley will be teaching the square dance lessons. The first two square dance lessons will be free.  We hope to see you there!
 We will be having only one dance during the month of September due to the holiday.  We hope that everyone has a safe day. Please join us for our "Let&rsquo;s Celebrate&rdquo; dance on the 18th.  This dance is Tri Squares 17th anniversary.  Our club caller is Terry Halley and our cuer is Sandra Pinion.  Our dance will start at 7:30 PM with 15 minutes of pre-rounds and 15 minutes of plus.  At 8PM we will start mainstream with every fourth tip plus.
