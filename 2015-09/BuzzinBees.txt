Greetings from the Buzzin Bees.  Hope everyone has had a good summer.  We have lots of news to share.  Bill Lundin has accepted a position with the Lions Club that will require frequent travel so he has decided to retire from club calling.  Our first dance of the new season , on September 19th, will be a "Thank you" dance in honor of Bill and Linda. I am pleased to announce that KC Curtis has accepted our offer to be our new club caller.  His first dance will be October 3rd. We welcome KC and Linda to the club. 

Elmer Toops received his long awaited kidney transplant. Looking forward to his feeling better.  Our lessons will start on Sunday September 20th from 6-8pm at the Hazel Dell Grange. We will continue with our 1st and 3rd Saturday dances  in September with the first Saturday being dark for Labor day. Hope to see you in a square.
