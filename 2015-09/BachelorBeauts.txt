After moving to Bend this winter, Dave and I just attended our first ever Central Oregon Round Up in Sisters.  The friendliness, food, decorations and dancing were truly special!  Our feet hurt and our tails were dragging at the end--definitely the sign of a successful dance event, don't you think?  What a great show by members of all the Central Oregon square and round dance clubs!  A big cowboy yell to all the CORU committee members who put this weekend together.  Can't wait 'til next August to do it again!  

Our annual spaghetti dinner kicks off the first dance in September on the 5th with Craig Ambercrombie calling and cuing.  On the 19th we'll be dancing to Ron Bliven and Carol Bro.

Let's dance!
