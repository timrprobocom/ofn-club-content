Things are getting back to normal, and we invite you all to come to our meeting Sept 21. Since we don&rsquo;t meet over the summer, we will have much to discuss.

One of the ideas is for a delegation of us to visit each club in our council and find out what their needs are, and how our council can help them.  We would also need to unify our clubs more, perhaps with additional council dances.
