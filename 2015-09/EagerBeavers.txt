Celebrate Labor Day by dancing with us at the Aloha Grange with George Clark calling.  Sunset Presbyterian Church is closed for Labor Day but we will be dancing there again with Daryl Clendenin on the 14th, Darrell Kalmbach on the 21st, and George Clark on the 28th.  George Clark is retiring at the end of September after a long and successful calling career.  We will be welcoming our new callers and cuers Darrell Kalmbach/Joyce Hooper and Daryl and Yvonne Clendenin starting in October.  
 Thirteen Eager Beavers made the trip to the Summer Festival in Klamath Falls for an enjoyable weekend with about 300 dancers from all over the state.  Our caller, George Clark, did a plus workshop and called a MS dance. The featured caller, Scott Byers, and his cuer wife Erin, did a fine job.  We send our thanks to the Interstate Highlanders Area Council and Klamath County Square for organizing a wonderful festival.
