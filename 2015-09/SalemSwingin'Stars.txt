Salem Swingin' Stars has continued dancing all summer long in our air conditioned hall! We had a great turnout for our July 3 Independence Day Celebration. Our third Friday dance was also well attended even though many of our club members were in Klamath Falls at Summer Festival. A big thank you to all of the clubs that came out and danced at our 5th Friday Plus Dance. We had 31 guests from 10 different clubs. WOW!
       On August 3, Nancy Donaldson, our VP, organized a visitation to the Golden Squares Pajama Dance. It was great fun.
      We danced through August and are looking forward to September! Look for the Flyer for our Annual Corn & Cluck Dance on September 18. Corn on the cob and chicken, plus other goodies will be served at 6:30 pm. For only $8.00; you can feast and dance to Randy Dibble with Jeanine Norden cueing.
      We dance on the first and third Fridays of the month. If there is a 5th Friday we have a Plus dance with Advance levels. Keep dancing and hope to see you soon!! Sheila Machado
