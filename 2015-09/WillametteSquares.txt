Willamette Squares enjoyed their "Fun in the Sun" dance. The dance was aptly named since the weather has been on the "sunny" side. Hot weather does not deter square dancers from dancing! Georgette had the Salem Square Dance Center decorated for the occasion. Everyone had a good time dancing the summer night away! 
Willamette Squares also enjoyed their annual summer picnic, a mix of good food and good dancing!
       Willamette Squares is proud to announce the election of Georgette Hagerman for a one year term as President to the Mid-Willamette Area Council. Willamette Squares will create and host the ceremony at the Salem Square Dance Center on September 21 at 7:30PM. We encourage everyone to show their support by attending. (Be there or be square!)
