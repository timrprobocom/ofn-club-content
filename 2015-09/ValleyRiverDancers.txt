The summer's been busy for the Valley River Dancers with two parades, hosting more than 100 dancers at our annual Dance Under the Stars, lessons, and our normal dance schedule. We are small and mighty! 
     Beginner lessons with teacher extraordinaire Randy Dibble will begin Tuesday, September 8 at 6:30 in Newberg. Please see our flyer for more information. Perrin Damon
