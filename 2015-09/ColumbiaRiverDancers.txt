Even the most modern buildings can have glitches.  So it was at a previous dance when the air conditioning decided to only blow warm air (yes, we dance in an air conditioned room at the Vancouver YMCA).  The air conditioner was repaired and our first dance in July was wonderful.  A new caller to the area, Jimmy Ellis, called squares with Dorothy Lowder cuing the rounds.  The Happy Hoppers had enough dancers and took one of our flags home.
 As a newer club we are trying to get ideas for theme dances and were asked to come in some theme attire we would like to pursue.  Many of us came dressed for Hawaii so that will probably be on the agenda one day soon.
 Our July 25th dance had Randy Dibble calling and Dorothy Lowder cuing.  The Valley Squares traveled from Aloha and were able to take a flag home with them.  We plan to get it back soon.  A great time was had by all.
 Our Saturday August 22nd dance will have Mike Stout calling and his wife, Julie, cuing.  Richard Lane will be back in September.
