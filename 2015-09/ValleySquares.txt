 Darrell Kalmbach filled in for Chuck at our 4th of July Dance.  We were dark for Summer Festival.  A number of us attended Dancing Under the Stars in Newberg, and we captured a banner from Columbia River Dancers the next evening. 
 History lessons about John Jacob Astor and Clatskanie, bingo games en route, a demo dance at the Maritime Museum, the main dance and dinner at Netel Grange, and a beach bonfire with singing and s'mores made for an excellent Mystery Trip.  Thanks to Judy and Julie for planning it, and Gary Hahn for driving the bus.
