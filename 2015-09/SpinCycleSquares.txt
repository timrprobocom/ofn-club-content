We are getting ready for the big Recruitment Dance August 22.  That's a Saturday.  We usually dance Sundays, but we'll be dark August 23.  The August 22 dance is free to new dancers and is a "Welcome to Square Dance" fun day.  We'll have a huge potluck for which we are famous.  This is a great opportunity to bring people to witness just how much fun square dancing is.  Christina Corelli will be on hand to cue a round or two and get folks involved in a line dance or mixer. 

National caller Kris Jensen from Albuquerque, New Mexico is calling this special dance.  She's GREAT!
