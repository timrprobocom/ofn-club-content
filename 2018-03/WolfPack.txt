We had a great Chinese New Year dance the first Saturday of the month​ in February, celebrating the Year of the Dog with our Boots and Sandals friends. Lennie Ludiker called and Christina cued.

Then on the fourth Saturday we celebrated the Boots and Sandals 65th birthday, also with Lennie and Christina.

The Wolf Pack will be celebrating a birthday on the first Saturday of March​ with​ Sandy Harris calling and Christina cueing.  We're at 20 years and counting.

If you haven’t been to one of our dances, you are missing a great time. Don’t forget, unless otherwise noted, we dance Plus from 7:30 to 8:00 and the​n​ Mainstream the rest of the evening.
