It has begun as a fun and busy New Year for a River City Dancers. We began by welcoming our new club caller couple Darrell Kalmbach and  his wife Erin. Our new dancer class graduated just before mid winter and our club visitation for January was to mid winter festival. Although many of our club members who regularly attend the annual mid winter festival were home sick with the flu and other maladies, our club was well represented with several members in attendance. A good time was had by all. January also brought us a fun visitation from Sunset Promenaders. A return visit to their club is in our future plans. 

Our club plans one visitation a month to visit other clubs and we now have a nice collection of banners from several clubs. If you are missing a banner come see us to see if we have it. We dance every second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community Center at 42nd and Jackson in Milwaukie. Darrel calls a great dance, so come join in the fun. We love having company.
