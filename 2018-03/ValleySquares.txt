Release your repressed pirate by attending our "Pirates of the Caribbean Dance," called by Scott Zinser and cued by Connie Clark at Aloha Grange, March 3rd, starting at 7 p.m.  Then don your green for our "Luck O' the Irish Dance" with the same caller and cuer, same place and same time March 17th.
 Please Save the Date for our 69th Anniversary Dance April 7th at Aloha Grange.  We're looking forward to a good crowd to help us celebrate.  Scott always calls a lively, fun dance and Connie has been cueing for years, albeit not 69!
 January started with our "Over the Rainbow" Dance.  Thanks to those who braved the wind and sleet and made merry for an evening.  Janienne Alexander was our caller for the "It's Cold Outside" Dance.  We are grateful for the visitors from Valley River and Toe Draggers.
 Lessons began January 15th.  We had 4+ squares of students and angels for the first two free lessons.  We are hoping they all continue.  Craig Abercrombie is a great teacher - already has everyone dancing in squares and moving at a lively pace but not so fast that people can't remember the moves they have rehearsed.
 Those of us who attended Midwinter met at the Jefferson Station Cafe for dinner Saturday night.  Midwinter is always a fun experience, seeing familiar faces from other clubs and meeting new friends.
