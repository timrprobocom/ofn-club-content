Celebrate St. Patrick’s Day, March 17th, by wearing that loud green sweater that doesn’t match anything else in your wardrobe.  If you practice daily you will be used to it by the end of the week.  
 MidWinter in Albany is popular with many of our dancers.  Our club voted to simply donate money instead of creating a fund raising basket for MidWinter Festival.  A collection jar was put out at the dances and a check for $75 was delivered to Chuck Eddings, MidWinter Chairman, by our club president. 
 We are proud of club member, Lane Clem, who has been hard at work practicing his caller skills.  He had been invited to call for a group in Salem on February 3rd.  Over a square of us helped out doing a Demo dance and then being angels for a teaching session.  There were two hundred people in attendance, many of them got into squares and said they could have danced for another hour.
 After a very successful Plus Class last year we are repeating our program which began February 5th.  Lessons are taught every Monday and run from noon to 1:15 with a Plus dance following until 3:00 pm.  This an opportunity for you who want to brush up on your Plus skills.  We still have the same three great callers giving the lessons: Daryl Clendenin, Jim Hattrick, and Darrell Kalmbach.  
 Warning:  On March 12th we “spring forward” to daylight saving time so remember to change ALL your clocks so you won’t be late to the dance.  Who wants to start a petition to quit the change and stay on standard time all year long?
 We dance on most holidays.  Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:15 to 3:00 pm, at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
