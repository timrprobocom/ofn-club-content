Well, time does pass.  On March 3rd the Columbia river Dancers will have out third (and some said we would never be here) anniversary dance.  We will be dancing to Adam Christman that evening.  We look forward to having many of our friends join us.  We take pride in our reputation as a club that insures that all who attend get to dance.  So, if you are a single, do not let that stop you from coming to help us celebrate our 3rd birthday.
 If you have not received an email from our Director Melissa James and want to stay up to date on all of our club activities, mention it the next time you come and we will make sure to get you on our email list either as a friend or as a new member.
 Our second dance in March will feature one of the callers from Mid-winter.  Our own Jim Hattrick will be calling and cueing on March 24th.  In addition, many of our new members will be advancing on to Plus.  Remember that we start new beginner lessons the first Tuesday of each month.  Many of our classes are small and we have great angels so our new dancers progress quickly.
 We look forward to another great year of dancing. Please come join us.
