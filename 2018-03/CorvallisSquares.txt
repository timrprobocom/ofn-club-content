Thanks to all who attended our Birthday Dance in February! It’s always a festive occasion. This March will be a fun month as we welcome Spring and doing some more dancing. We’re looking forward to our coast trip March 9 & 10 at Gleneden Beach Community Club and dancing both Friday and Saturday nights. We want to mention again that all are welcome! This has been a longstanding tradition for the Corvallis Squares. For the Saturday lunch potluck there will be good humor and good food, and if you want you can bring a joke to share! Happy Spring to all! Karen
