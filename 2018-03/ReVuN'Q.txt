ReVuNQ starts Jive lessons on March 15 for dancers who know some cues or none at all. We will be starting from the beginning for all the dancers. We are looking forward to a good class and welcome any new comers.
	
During February, we did mostly dancing to cement the Waltz moves we have learned over the last several months. Our class decreased in size due to work schedules and other things that were more important. Our club is small but still going.

We have been talking about what we are going to do for the early summer class and I think we are going to Slow Two Step. Put that on your calendar for summer time. Date to be announced.

NOTICE-----We will be changing our dance time to show lessons at 6:30 to 7:20. We will dance Phase 3-4 from 7:30 to 8:20 and Phase 4+ from 8:30 to 9:30. This starts on March 15 when we start our Jive class. Please mark your calendars for the change.
	
Lots of our members attended Mid-Winter Festival and enjoyed the dancing in the round dance hall. I was busy otherwise, so I am hoping to see the dances during our Thursday night meetings. Come see us. We enjoy company. Marilyn Schmit
