Hi Everyone,
The Fifth Friday Rogue Sis-Q Council Dance is set and in the works. It will be March 30 and Jim Steele will be our caller. Mary Nutt is the scheduled cuer. The theme, of course, is "Go Green with Rogue Sis-Q Council." In March, would the theme be anything else? Wear your best green outfit and come play with us.

There is also progress on this June's Summer Festival. More information to come later.

We are still asking people to come out and support the new classes that started in January. These people are the future of our activity and need our support. PLEASE come out, you'll be glad you did.

PLEASE support the Council and the Clubs in the Rogue Valley. Everyone needs all the support they can get. Times are "skinny," so, please come out and help by supporting your local clubs.

The next Council meeting bwill be April 3, 2018 at Denny's Restaurant on Biddle Road at 4:30pm.

There are still "Learn to Square Dance" t-shirts available. We have found the t-shirts to be great conversation starters.

Lois & Lorri
