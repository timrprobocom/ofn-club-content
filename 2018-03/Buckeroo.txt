We hope you all had as much fun as we did at the Mid-Winter Festival! It is so much fun to see so many dancers all together enjoying this pastime that we all love! It is also fun to catch up with friends that we have not seen in awhile.

Here at the barn, things are sure busy. We have been doing some cleaning and rearranging and things are looking great! If you have not been here recently, come have a look!

We have just begun a winter session of mainstream and round dance lessons. The mainstream lessons will be Friday evenings and both new dancers and experienced dancers are welcome. We really appreciate the experienced dancers who come out as “angels” and help introduce square dancing to new members of our community. Round dance classes are on Tuesday evenings and will begin with teaching Two-Step. Latin rhythms such as Cha Cha, Rumba, and Mambo will also be taught.

We will be having our Sweetheart Dance on the 17th of February, so get your valentine and extend the celebration. Chuck Simpkins will be calling the squares and Neil Koozer will be doing the rounds.

On the 24th of February the Buckeroos will be carpooling down to Medford to help the Star Promenaders celebrate their birthday! It is sure to be a great party and we are looking forward to joining them.

Remember… we are just a short drive south from the Portland area, so plan to join us in the near future. We dance the first and third Saturdays and always enjoy having visitors. We have members of all ages and are a family friendly club.

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
