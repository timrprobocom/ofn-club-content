Another Mid-Winter Festival has come and gone! Our club members staffed the Greeter's Booth both days but also had time for dancing. Featured Callers Dan Preedy and Buddy Weaver did a wonderful job and a good time was the result for everyone that I spoke to. If you missed it, put it on your list for next year with Ray Brendzy as Featured Caller. We had a great club photo taken at Mid-winter, too. 

Come dance with us on the third Saturday at Dayton Community Center. Carmen
