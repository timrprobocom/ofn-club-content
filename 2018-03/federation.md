### Publicity/Education

Our Educational Seminar during Mid-Winter in January was a Round Table Discussion on “Looking for Fun in All the Right Places”.  Dave Cooper and Lee Ashwill led a great discussion on how to find and create fun in our clubs, councils & festivals. I would like to encourage you to click on the links to the handouts that 
[Dave](/content/2018-03/2018-01-Seminar-Cooper.pdf) and 
[Lee](/content/2018-03/2018-01-Seminar-Ashwill.pdf) distributed during the session and read them.  I’ve summarized their ideas and added a few below.

First and foremost we need to remember that square and round dancing and clogging are social activities.  We are here to socialize and have fun. We need to remember to focus on what is great about our activity.  Be positive.  Don’t look for things that you think are wrong, look for ways to improve our activity. Focus on what is right, be positive and encouraging.  Look to the future and stop worrying about how we did it in the past.

The club is the backbone of all square and round dancing activity, and our club members are part of our extended families. We can improve the strength of our bonds by playing together and participating in fun extracurricular events such as progressive dinners, mystery trips, beach trips, game nights, carpooling to special events or to other dances in the area.  It’s OK to have extra events without dancing, just as it is also OK to add dancing to your extra events. You can also invite other clubs in your area to participate with you.  

Before or after your dances, encourage people to get together for dinner before the dance, or for milk & cookies after the dance.  Think outside the box for special dances, and advertise them. Try a dance where you turn out the lights and dance with flashlights.  Advertise an amateur hour where people can try their hand at calling or cuing. Try a Running Bear dance challenge, challenge your dancers to a dance until you drop with no breaks during the dance, or end your special dance with a last square standing challenge. The key is, just have fun and enjoy each other. When people see you are having fun, they will want to join you.

Next time your club sponsors lessons, approach them with a positive attitude.  It sometimes takes many times of asking someone to come to lessons before they come. Don’t give up – be positive.  Show prospective students how much fun you are having. Do demo dances, dance at the fair, or dance on a float during a parade.  Be visible. Another way to bring interest to your club is to give back to the community you live and dance in. Volunteer as a group.  If you can wear your outfits, it will be a great way to talk about square dancing. If you can’t wear your outfit, wear your badge and most importantly, wear a smile.

If your council is considering sponsoring a festival or dance event, set up some special event or competition during the day.  A few events that have been tried in the past are suitcase races, outhouse races, and dunk tanks. You’ll be surprised; the special events are what people fondly remember.  Don’t be afraid to try something new.

In summary, we’d like you to remember to have fun, be positive and get involved.
