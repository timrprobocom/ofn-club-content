Food has been on the minds of our Happy Hopper members during the month of February.  Perhaps you may be thinking this is a strange comment. However, our traditional food drive month for the North Clark County Food Bank is February.  As of this date, the total pounds of food have not been tallied, but we are hoping to exceed the amount collected last year.  Following the holiday season, we have also enjoyed resuming our dine-out nights. We seem to be international in our restaurant selections. Previously we sampled Italian and German cuisine.   February will be no exception as we will be going to a Mexican restaurant at the end of the month.  Dining out together is a great way to have a chance to enjoy a good meal while visiting with friends.

On March 12th at our Monday night lessons we will be having a gently used clothing resale starting at 6:00 P.M.  We are fortunate to have a sizeable inventory of women's and men's square dance clothing which we sell at amazingly low prices.  If you have new dancers looking for square dance attire, or if you are wishing to enlarge your own wardrobe, this sale is for you.  

If you have a bit of the Irish in you, you won't want to miss Jim Hattrick's Irish calling.  Our second March dance is St Patrick's Day; so of course, we'll be celebrating with Irish sundaes and all manner of Irish fun.  We hope to see you there.
