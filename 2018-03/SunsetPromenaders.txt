The Promenaders are working hard with an ambitious lesson schedule each Sunday of Basic Two-Step lessons from 2 to 4 with Ken Pratt instructing, Mainstream Square Dance from 4 to 6 with Mike Stout instructing, and Intermediate Round Dance from 6:30 to 8 with Ken instructing.  All the lessons are coming along well and we are happy especially about the people and number of people in the square dance lessons.
 Our March dance calendar is:
 • March 1st our Thursday evening Plus Dance 7:00 to 9:30 with Darrell Kalmbach and Ken Pratt calling and cueing.
 • March 3rd our Saturday evening Mainstream Dance 7:00 to 9:30 with Mike Stout and Ken Pratt calling and cueing.  February 15th, Thursday Plus Dance, with Darrell and Ken.
 • March 15th, Thursday Plus dance with Darrell and Ken.  
 • March 17th, Saturday Mainstream Dance, with Mike and Ken. The dance theme is Irish Fling so come dressed as a leprechaun or anyway you wish, just come and enjoy our dance, our people, our caller, our cuer, etc.  By the way the leprechaun usually leaves some gold laying around, maybe you will be the lucky person to find it.
 • Our schedule each dance is Round dance at 7:00, Square Dance starts at 7:30 until 9:30.  Additional parking is available at the bank across the street.  The Location is IOOF Hall (upstairs) at 267 E. Main St. in Hillsboro.  503-805-5867 for information..
