At press time the IWW Mainstream students (an outstanding class!) are putting finishing touches on their dancing skills, looking forward to their first Mid-Winter Festival, and to graduation on February 18. Congratulations to our students, who are doing a great job. And heartfelt thanks to our committed group of angels who shared their experience and especially their enthusiasm with our new crop of square dancers.

We had a fun Pajama Dance in January, with good attendance and enthusiastic participation in the pajama theme. Upcoming special dances are our Birthday Dance on March 10 (celebrating 58 years!) and a Kentucky Derby Dance in May. Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays at the Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall. Dee and Bert Mackaman
