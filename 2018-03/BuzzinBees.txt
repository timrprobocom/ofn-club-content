Greetings from the Buzzin' Bees. We have been enjoying a warmer-than-normal winter and the crocuses are blooming in my yard. Spring is right around the corner. We just had our annual pie eating contest and our winner this year is Damien Carter, one of our teams. He attacked that pie systematically and came up the winner. See picture section of this magazine.

We have been enjoying our new cuer schedule. Dorothy Lowder cues the first Saturday Dance and Lonnie Sykes cues for the 3rd Saturday dance.

March is a busy month for us. We will have a regular dance on 3/3 and our theme dance will be on 3/17 - St Patrick's Day. We will be wearing the green and will have Irish Sundays (loaded baked potatoes) for the break. We will also be making some visitations in March.

Looking to the Future, we have our anniversary dance coming up on April 21st. It is our 60th anniversary so we are calling it our Diamond Jubilee. Hope to see you there.

Respectfully, Debbie Broers
