The Rogue Squares still have 3 students every week. Phil is very pleased with their progress. We were dark over the holidays, but these kids are right back in the groove and doing great.

The Rogue Squares "Love to our Sweetheart" dance was a lot of fun. For those of you who didn't make it, you missed a very good caller. his name is Ed Kremers and he is from Magalia, CA. He put us through our paces without us knowing about it until the tip was over. Everyone had a great time. Thanks to the Stars, Charlie's Circle 'N Squares and the independent dancers who attended. We really do appreciate you.

In March, to celebrate the "Month of Green," we will have Lawrence Johnstone call our dance. He is a favorite of the dancers in Southern Oregon. We will be dark in April for Pear Blosom.

We are still working on the future for The Rogue Squares.

See you in a square!!!
