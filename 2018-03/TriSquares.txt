In February we had our Mardi Gras Masquerade Ball, this year soliciting donations for prizes from local businesses – and wow, the total value of the many raffle items and door prizes came to more than $1,000!  Wine tastings, certificates from restaurants, care repair, spa visits, baking supplies, bowling & pizza, cat pet supplies… something for everyone.  A big thanks to treasurer Bob Davis who headed up getting the donations.  Also thanks to all of you who attended!
 In March our Mainstream lessons will end with a graduation celebration.  Our dance on March 10th will be very green for St. Patrick’s Day, and on the 23rd we’ll get happy for our “Spring Fling”.  Please join us if you can.
