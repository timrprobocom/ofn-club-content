First let me apologize to the River City Dancers for the mistake I made writing last month's article.  We had a wonderful visit not to the River City Dancers but to the Valley River Dancers, a group that offered outstanding hospitality, along with excellent calling (since we share Randy Dibble as our caller) and cuing by Julie Stiers.  It was, in fact, the Valley River Dancers that we visited!  As I said, we had a wonderful time there. 
 The April issue will have a report on how our DBD plus lessons work out, starting at 6:00 on our dance nights.  
 With February almost here as this is being written, we haven't needed the warning about checking our website for bad weather notice.  Of course, I've seen snow as late as April 21st in this area, so complacency isn't advised.  All those daffodils shooting up beside the road could be wrong.
