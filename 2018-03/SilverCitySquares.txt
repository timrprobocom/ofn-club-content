Thank you to everyone who attended our birthday dance in February. We had a great time dancing to Leonard and Frances.
Our fundraiser dance is Sunday, March 4. Check out our flyer for all of the details. We will draw our raffle winners during the dance and there will be three lucky winners of $100 each. We will also have a silent auction/basket raffle going on as well.
We have been having practices through February with some of us being new and having to learn all of the styling needed and some of us having to work extra hard on the mysteries at a plus level. Right now, we will have two squares. The Silver Dragons will be either Intermediate or Senior Level (mom is still checking on that) and the Silver Knights will be Novice Level (they only have to dance singing calls/display).
Don't forget to sign up to volunteer. You have to contact Karyn Buchheit to do that! (503-873-5241 or buchheitfarmkm@gmail.com ) Also, don't forget to get your festival pin ahead of time as these allow you into the festival and the open dances Friday and Saturday evenings. We sell them for $2 each, but if you wait to buy at the door, the price is $4 each. See you at a dance. Petrina Buchheit
