Our club had a great celebration of its 69 years of dancing on Sunday, January 21 with over seven squares in attendance. Charlotte Jeskey and Jim Voll were the callers and Jackie Gale cued. Strawberry shortcake was served at our break time.  Following the dance, we had graduation and a pizza party for our new dancers. The Lebanon Square Circlers welcomed nine new dancers.  It was a super fun day. 

The next weekend was Mid Winter Festival time and many of our club members enjoyed the weekend. We had a "Pajama Dance" on February 3 and will have another regular dance on February 17 with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  We will be attending Sweet Home Squarenaders Birthday Dance on February 10. 
  
March will be a busy month as we are planning for a Hippie Dance on the 3rd, with our regular caller and cuer. On March 17, "Girls Night Out" will be calling and Jackie Gale cueing. Sounds like lots of fun!  Our club has scheduled its "Mystery Trip" for March 31.  There is an open invitation, so anyone interested should call Frank Cawrse. The more the merrier. 

Of course, Lebanon Square Circlers is starting preparations for the Strawberry Festival weekend in early June. We hope that many dancers will come to Lebanon for this celebration. See you in a square!  Marilyn York
