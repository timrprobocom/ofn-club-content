Our next scheduled Fifth Saturday Dance is March 31.  That is ear-marked as our Emerald Area's Annual Benefit Dance.  The area is responsible for advertising, acquiring callers and cuers, taking care of the door, etc.  This year's beneficiary is Honor Flight.  Several of our dancers have either gone as Veterans or have accompanied Veterans on this special trip to Washington D.C.  It's a wonderful way to thank those who have served our country. 

Our next scheduled dances are June 30, September 29 and December 29.  We'll have to decide whether or not we'll actually have a dance December 29 since New Year's Eve is just a couple of days later. 

Our current board is President - Linda Putzler, Vice-President - Sandy Eddings, Secretary - Christina Corelli, Treasurer - Gail Jackson.   An all woman board.

We do have fairly new callers and cuers who have joined CCCA and call and/or cue at our fifth Saturday dances.  We have a CCCA meeting prior to the dance. 

Keep on dancing, calling and cueing for FUN!
Christina Corelli
Secretary  - CCCA
