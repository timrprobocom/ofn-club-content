Hallelujah!  Spring is on its way.  I hope all of you survived the icy roads that arrived unexpectedly in February.  I am so looking forward to summer!

When summer arrives in just 4 short months, it will also be ushering in Oregon’s 2018 Summer Festival in the beautiful Rogue Valley.  Summer Festival this year is June 22-24, in Grants Pass.  Their featured caller is Dan Nordbye.  Anyone who has attended a Dan Nordbye dance can attest that he puts on a great dance.  He is challenging, yet easy to dance to.  His voice is excellent and his calling superb.  Steve and Judy Storm are well known full-time cuers from Utah.  In addition to cueing and dancing, they also compose round dances.

In addition to the excellent featured caller and cuers and our very own wonderful Oregon callers and cuers, the Summer Festival Committee is working on a great Youth Program.  As details become available, I will be posting them on the Federation Facebook page. They are also working on arranging activities around the area – making this not only a great summer festival, but the kick off to a fun vacation in Southern Oregon.  If you are on the fence trying to decide whether or not to buy your ribbon, please buy one today.  You will be glad you did.

See you in a square…
