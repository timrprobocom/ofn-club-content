Toes had a great Mid-Winter Festival and want to thank everyone that had a part in putting on an outstanding weekend.  Our new dancers were ready to go down to Albany to dance the weekend away.  This group of new dancers worked so hard.  We are so excited for the ones that chose to join the club.  Our family is growing also with a couple joining the club from Bev and Harlan’s Round Dance class.  2018 is starting off with a bang for our family of Toes.
 We hope our Ground Hog Dance has ushered in Spring early.  So, looking forward to warmer days: Our Sweetheart Ball on February 16th is one of our favorite dances.  We love getting all decked out in our favorite square dance outfits and dance away the evening with our favorite friends.
 March 2nd is our regular dance at the Kinton Grange.  Be sure to pick out your favorite green outfit to wear to our Shamrock Sashay Dance on March 16th.  We’ll be sharing lots of Irish luck, love and friendships to everyone.
 Remember on April 6th our first dance is over at the Odd Fellows Hall in Hillsboro.  Then we will be back to the Kinton Grange for our regular schedules.
 See you in a square.
