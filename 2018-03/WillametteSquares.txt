After going dark for December due to Christmas, and in January due to Winter Festival, Willamette Squares will be resuming its regular dances on the fourth Saturday evening of each month. We had a great turnout for our New Dancer Dance and are looking forward to seeing new and old dancers at our upcoming dances. Many dancers took advantage of our experienced clothing sale. 
On February 4 new round dance lessons consisting of the waltz and hosted by Willamette Squares at the Salem Square Dance Center began. There will be no further square dance lessons until next fall.
Our president, John Templin, has gone to Arizona for the remainder of the winter months. As the saying goes, "When the cat's away, the mice will play." Chase those winter doldrums away and come dance and play with us during his absence. When he returns, you can be among the many who can inform him of all the good times he missed! He, in turn, will be missed, but knowing John, he will undoubtedly find square dancing opportunities in Arizona and be more than willing to share them with us. Jodee Howard
