Happy Dancing Everyone
 R Square D's first dance of 2018, was our Snowflake Frolic on January 12th.  Craig kept three squares dancing to snowflake songs, Lonnie Sycks cued.  An array of soups were served and enjoyed at break.
 We did not dance the 4th Saturday, so those who wanted could attend Mid Winter Festival in Albany Oregon.
