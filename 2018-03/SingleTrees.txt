Single Trees only had one dance in January as we always go dark for Mid-Winter on the 4th Friday.  Jim Hattrick and Jackie Gale called and cued for a floor full of happy dancers.  We were pleased to see some newly graduated dancers come out to join us and hope they will continue to do so.  One of the latest graduates has joined our club, and we are pleased to have him.  He went to Mid-Winter and had a great time.

There were a number of Single Trees who attended Mid-Winter for the full weekend or else only went up on Saturday.  A couple of us were in the advanced hall most of the time, but others spread themselves around between the new dancer hall, mainstream and plus halls.  We all had a great time but did wonder why there was no plus or advanced offered Sunday morning for those of us who came for the entire weekend. 

The featured callers Dan Preedy and Buddy Weaver did a terrific job of calling to the floor, and we even got to preview next year’s featured caller Ray Brendzy who was there with his family from Canada.  He is a very personable caller with a clear voice, and we should have a great time dancing to him next year.

We are hoping that our donated chocolate basket made lots of money for Mid-Winter 2018—there were lots of baskets to be raffled off, each and every one of them looking great.

We are looking forward in March to our annual St. Patrick’s Dance with many showing up in green or wearing shamrocks in some fashion or other.  We have a baked potato feed that really goes over well with the dancers—baked potatoes with all the trimmings—yumm!  Jim Hattrick will be calling this dance with Jackie Gale cueing.  Come dance with us!
