March is often associated with lions and lambs but the Oaky Doaks are focusing their attention to more domesticated animals. Come join us on Saturday, March 3rd, for our "Reigning Cats and Dogs Dance". We are collecting donations of cat food for Ani-Meals, an organization that helps seniors and veterans feed their pets, and dog food for Dogs New Life, a no kill dog shelter. "Vote" who reigns with your donation - Cats or Dogs! Cuer Molly Combs will start the dance off with Pre-Rounds at 7:00 pm. Caller Mark Wheeler will be doing Mainstream from 7:30 to 9:30 pm. Break will be at 9:30 pm where the answer to the question of who reigns at this year's dance being announced. CAT RULE! DOGS DROOL!

On Saturday, March 17th, we hope that you will follow that slippery little leprechaun to the end of the rainbow and find us there. Come dance and enjoy the blarney while Caller Janienne Alexander and Cuer Molly Combs prove the Irish Proverb, "A tune is more lasting than the song of the birds, and a word is more lasting than the wealth of the world". Pre-Rounds start at 7:00 pm, Mainstream with Rounds starts at 7:30 pm and Break will be at 9:30 pm. 

Be very, very quiet. The Oaky Doaks are on the hunt. We're looking for our club banners. Have you seen one lately? Let us know where you saw and we will go track it down. 

Hope to see you across the square.
