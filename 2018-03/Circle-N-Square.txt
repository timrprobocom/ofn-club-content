Thank you Dean and Mary for a good Valentine Dance.

Happy to see our new dancers going up over the hill and dancing with other clubs, January, most of them got a purple heart. Also, they stole a banner from one of the clubs in Medford. They went to new dancer dance in February and had a ball up there. Other dancers went up to the Stars Birthday Dance with Lawrence Johnstone to celebrate their 61st birthday. Way to go Stars.

Our next dance is the St. Patrick's Dance on Saturday, March 17, 2018.
