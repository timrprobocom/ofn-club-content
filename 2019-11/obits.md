title: Lloyd Mutinsky

It saddens me to report to the membership that our Lifetime Member of Single Trees Lloyd Mutinsky has passed away due to complications of diabetes and dementia.  He was a member of our club since 1982 but has not danced with us for quite some time.   He has been in acre facility near his long time home in Sweet Home.  Many of you will remember Lloyd as the wonderful photographer who kept beautiful albums of the many photos he would take at dances and festivals around the state.  He was a great help tome when I first started out as club newsletter editor giving me CDs full of photos to choose from for the monthly editions.  He also was official photographer for Mid-Winter for many years.  I understand he was a photographer for a leading newspaper in Oakland, CA before moving here to Sweet Home where he became a court reporter for many years before retiring.  He loved photography so much he became involved with the writer Ken Kesey and musician-composer Mason Williams and took photos at their events as well.  Lloyd danced well at the mainstream, plus and advanced levels.  He'll be missed by those who knew him well over the years.  Please pass this on to anyone involved with Mid-Winter in the 80's, 90's and early 2000's.
