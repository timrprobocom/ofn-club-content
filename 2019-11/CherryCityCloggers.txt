The Cherry City Cloggers have had quite a busy start to Fall. In to our fifth week of lessons for beginning Cloggers, we have about 12 new attendees doing very well at learning to clog. It is great to see our club beginning to grow again. 

We have about 17 cloggers that regularly come to our 4:00 class, which goes at a little slower pace than the intermediate class even though many in the 4:00 class are intermediate level dancers. In our intermediate class that meets at 6:30, we have around 15 that come on a regular basis with a few who drop in as time permits. 

Two of our instructors, Staci and Glee, had an exciting adventure the first weekend in October. They flew to Canada and took part in the First Canadian National Clogging Convention.

The club was also asked to perform at the Oregon Bounty Celebration the first weekend in October. We had about 10 members who participated.  

October was the month where our officers for 2020 were elected. They will fill their positions in January. Georganne
