As the Council is encouraging all dancers to attend the anniversary dances of member clubs, we are off to a running start this year.  Some are going dark to attend another club!  The month of September had three anniversary dances; the Wavesteppers, Toedraggers, and TriSquares.  I only have information from the latter two dances.
 On Friday, September 20th the Kinton Grange was rocking with 97 dancers.  The Toe Draggers 44th Berry Good Anniversary dance was indeed very good!  KC Curtis and Roger Putzler called and Bev Flint cued a great dance.  Eleven of the fourteen TVC clubs were in attendance.
 Also on a Friday, September 27th, the TriSquares held their 21st Anniversary dance at the Tigard Grange.  Several of the old timers mentioned that the Grange had not had that many dancers in a long, long time.  That number was 108, over 13 squares, with 8 dancing pre-plus!  Guest national caller Adam Christman suggested that the dancers checkerboard their squares, a concept new to some.  Sandra Pinion cued the rounds for the evening.  
 Our next Council event is a fifth Saturday Dance, held at the Aloha Grange on November 30th.  This dance will feature Mike and Julie Stout calling and cueing.  The dance begins with pre-rounds at 7:30 followed by Mainstream with rounds at 8:00.  Every third tip will be Plus.  This dance is co-hosted our brand new club to the TVC, the Oak Hills Squares.
 Since the OFN is published mid month, you may still have time to plan on the Mix 'N Mingle anniversary dance on October 19th.  See their flyer for format information.  They are dancing Mainstream for this dance with Randy Dibble calling and Sherri Clark cueing.
