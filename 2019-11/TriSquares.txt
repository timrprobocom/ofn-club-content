In September Tri Squares had two free Mainstream lessons.  22 students came to the first one and 19 to the second.  Eleven signed up and eight more said they would the next week.  So we have great hopes for our lessons this year.  We owe a lot to the wonderful advertising provided for us by the Tigard Library who kindly posted our information on their website newsletter.  We also have eight students signed up for our Two-Step lessons.  Lessons are at the Tigard Grange on Sundays, at 2:00 for Two-Step and 3:30 for Mainstream, with our caller Terry Halley and our Cuer Sandra Pinion.
 Also in September some of our members helped our Grange by participating in a work party to clean up and paint part of the Grange, all for just a free lunch. 
 We had a great time visiting the Toe Draggers for their anniversary dance.
 Then the following week we had our own 21st anniversary dance with 108 people on the floor.  Wow, eight squares of PrePlus dancers!  Many thanks to all who came and to all who served, too.
 Upcoming on Sunday November 3rd we’re having a New Dancer Jamboree, at 3:30.  And please remember, we’ve changed our dance nights to 2nd and 4th Fridays now, with a “Homecoming” dance on November 8th and “Grateful Harvest” on November 22nd.
 See you on Fridays from now on!
