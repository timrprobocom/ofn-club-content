     The Hoppers have been in their new location, the Washington Grange, for a
year now and it’s finally feeling like home. One of the greatest benefits of our new
location has been the number of individuals who have come to participate in our
lessons. Without any other square dance clubs near-by we have found that many
people living in the area are interested in taking lessons close to home. Our lesson year began in September with a combined total of about 32 students enrolled in either plus or basic and mainstream classes. The combination of some terrific Hopper angels and highly motivated and enthusiastic students make lesson nights a lot of fun.

     About once a month throughout the dance year Hoppers have a dine-out where we get together at a local restaurant for dinner and fellowship. We have begun inviting our lesson people to this event as a way of encouraging them to feel included in our group and to get to know some of our members in a setting other than a dance. Not all students feel comfortable attending the dine-outs, but our members seem to enjoy the opportunity to spend time with fellow dancers and to get to know some of the students in a relaxed atmosphere.

     During the month of October many Hopper members will be found at the R Square D’s Octoberfest and at the Seaside Sashay in Seaside, Oregon. We always look forward to both of these events. We’ll also have our own Harvest Day dance on October 19 th featuring all pumpkin desserts. Yum! Then, it’s on to November and a lot of great dance opportunities at clubs in the area to work off all the wonderful food we will all be eating during the holidays. Additionally,
we will begin collecting toys for our annual toy drive at our November 16 th dance. In the middle of December all the toys and gifts we have collected will be given to The Children’s Center, a nonprofit serving children and families.
