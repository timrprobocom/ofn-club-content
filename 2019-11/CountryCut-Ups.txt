Whew! October was a busy month! We celebrated the 59th anniversary of our club and the 100th anniversary of the Boring Barn.  Still coming as of this writing is our annual Ham, Egg, and Pancake Breakfast and Bazaar, one of our biggest fundraisers to keep our old barn going. Then the Halloween Black Light Dance will be our last dance of the month.

November will be another exciting month, but not quite so hectic. We have a great mainstream class going with 27 students as of the 5th lesson. Over half are under 25 and they are quick learners. Our biggest challenge is getting enough angels here. We are getting a good response from our club, but he students still outnumber the angels. It is a great problem to have!

We will be dancing 1st, 4th, and 5th Saturdays this month. Come dance off some turkey and pie on November 30th to the calling and cueing of Craig Abercrombie. Rumor has it that we will be raffling off a turkey that night!

Several Cut-ups will be attending the Riverside County Dance Festival in Indio, CA, November 7-10th. We had so much fun last year that we are bringing even more people this year!
