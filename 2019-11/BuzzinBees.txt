At our black light dance last month everyone wore white gloved hands flowing in the dark, was a lot of fun. Those waring white clothes had were dancing around with no legs.  Very appropriate for Halloween.  

November our first dance will be a regular dance and the 2nd dance will have a Red, White and blue themed dance.  See you in a square The Bee
