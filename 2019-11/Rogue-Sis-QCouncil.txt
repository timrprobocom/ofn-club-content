Rogue Sis Q Council is quiet right now, no council dances until our Pajamara Dance on December 10th with Richard Lane calling and Rikki Lobato cueing. 
It will be an exciting dance where we get to wear our favorite pajamas.  See the flyer for times for advanced, pre-rounds, and mainstream.
All dancers are requested to support the Charlie Browns Birthday dance the first Saturday in December.  
We hope to see you at the Charlie Brown Birthday in December, and then our Pajama Party in January.

See you in a Round or Square,
Lorri
