It’s good to be dancing at our club dance hall again at the Polk County Fairgrounds, after having been dark in August to make way for the Polk County Fair. We are excited about our new class of Mainstream students and welcome them to the square dance family.  It’s always exciting to feel the enthusiasm of a new generation of dancers. We’ve had up to seven squares dancing at lessons – With 34 Mainstream students and terrific Angel participation. Well done to Membership Coordinators Dave O’Neill and Lee Ashwill!   Our September “Favorite Sports Team” special dance highlighted ongoing good-natured rivalries. If truth be told, at IWW it doesn’t require a Favorite Sports Team special dance for us to hear a rousing “Go Ducks!” (or “Go …. !”) at the occasional opportune (and sometimes inopportune) moment. Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays of each month at the Polk County Fairgrounds.  Especially be sure that you mark your calendars for our special dances:   December 14 Christmas Dance with Silent Auction; February 8 “Mix it up” Dance; March 8 (Sunday) IWW 60th Birthday Dance. Looking ahead: Mystery trip (date to be determined); Salvation Army bell ringing December 9 – 12 (at Macy’s); Annual Koast Krash April 24 – 26 (Yachats Inn. Theme: At the Hop).
