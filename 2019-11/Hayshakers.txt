Our next dance is on the 3rd Friday of November (the 15th) with Mark Wheeler calling.
 The 5th Friday dance falls on the day after Thanksgiving...  Check our website HayShakers.org as the time gets closer to see whether or not we have a dance on November 29th.
 With Mainstream lessons completed, we will hold Mainstream workshops throughout November and December to polish new Hayshakers skills so that they can go out and dance with any Mainstream Club and do so successfully.
