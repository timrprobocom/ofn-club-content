Wolf Pack is still struggling to keep going as a club. We have had some very poorly attended dances and are looking for help from other clubs to come dance with us when you can. We had a Pirate Dance recently and our 4th Saturday caller Lennie Ludiker was gone hunting so Mark Wheeler stepped in to call.  Thanks Mark.
We have several special theme dances coming up.  Please join us when you can.  Sandy Harris call's the first Saturday and Lennie Ludiker on 4th Saturdays with Christina Corelli cueing both dances.
