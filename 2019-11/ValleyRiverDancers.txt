The Valley River Dancers dance Plus on 2nd Fridays, and Mainstream on 4th Fridays in Newberg at the Chehalem Community Center, located on the corner of 2nd and Howard Streets. We dance ‘A’ on 5th Saturdays at the Woodburn Senior Estates Community Club. Randy Dibble is our Caller. Ken Pratt cues 2nd Friday; Sherri Clark cues 4th Friday. https://www.valleyriverdancers.org
 A round dance workshop continues preceding our 2nd Friday dance, led by Ken and Dianne Pratt, beginning at 6:30 pm.  We've been able to bring our questions and dance figure struggles to the pros and have them help us smooth out our bumps.  Come put your dance shoes on and work out some kinks with us!  
 Our Mainstream November 22nd dance features our annual gospel dance.  Randy Dibble has an amazing voice and these inspirational songs are especially awesome.  Come on out for a fun evening and then join us at  Abby's Pizza in Newberg after the dance for complimentary sodas.
