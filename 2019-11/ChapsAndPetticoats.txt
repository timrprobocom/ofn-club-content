Soon Thanksgiving will be here; what are you thankful for?  WE are thankful for fun times with good friends - our Pirate Dance, on OCT 4th, was full of both.  Four(+) squares danced to Mr. Pirate, Scott Zinser, and the Cuer was Tami Helms, who was dressed as an awesome Wench.  Our judges: Egan, Sharon Driscoll and Jay awarded three prizes: Male, Scott Zinser, Female, Tami Helms and the Couple prize went to Bev (the pirate) and Mark, (the wench) with Country Cut-Ups.  Two clubs took home visitation banners:  Country Cut-Ups and Bachelor & Bachelorettes.  Thanks to all in attendance - you made the theme such fun!

We have six strong students attending our Cha-Cha lessons taught by Connie Clark; four students are Chaps, thus we are growing our dance skills and decided to keep the Round lessons going.   Our final number of Mainstream students has yet to be determined, due to vacations in progress:  the number is likely 8-10.   We appreciate our Angels very much which allows us a healthy two squares for MS instruction.

At our next dance, November 1st, Scott Zinser will open with Plus and we will have Leonard Snodgrass as our Cuer for the first time ... we hope you join us and make it lively dance.  

Chaps & Petticoats will be DARK November 15th.   We hope you save your energy for our "Turkey-Trot" New-Dancer JAMBOREE on November 24th from 4:00-7:30pm (with Turkey Dinner served at 5:30pm).  Angels, please bring your students:  Scott Zinser will call to the floor (max. level 36), Mark McDonald (& Bobbi) will Cue a round between tips and "experienced clothing" will also be sold.

Happy Feet,
Betty Chipps
