It seemed a quiet September with days flying faster than children with trick or treat bags running to the next house to stock up on enough treats to last until Thanksgiving. 
 We enjoyed visitations to both Toe Draggers and Tri-Squares in September.  The second half of the dances we donned our green vests advertising Summer Festival 2020 in Seaside.  
 Time to visit a new club, the Oak Hills Squares, who are co-hosting the next TVC dance on November 30th at Aloha Grange, 185th and TV Highway.  Pre-rounds start at 7:30, Mainstream and rounds at 8:00, with every 3rd tip Plus. 
 Plan ahead for the New Yearâ€™s Dance with a  black, red, silver color theme in case you needed an excuse for a new outfit.  We and the Sunset Promenaders are hosting this dance with some help from TVC.  When you are planning for Thanksgiving and Christmas do not forget to include a night of great dancing to welcome in the New Year.
 We dance on most holidays. Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 p.m. - 3:00, at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
