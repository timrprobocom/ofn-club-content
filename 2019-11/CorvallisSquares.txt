It was fun to gather at our all-comers dance in September and introduce local folks to square and line dancing. We even had some kids join in. So our fall lessons are off to a good start with instructor Bruce Lowther. Weâ€™re partnering with Linn-Benton Community College again, to offer lessons in their lovely gym. 

At the end of October we're looking forward to our traditional Halloween Dance and will enjoy the festivities. For November, our club is dark on the second Saturday only, in honor of Sweet Home Squarenaders' Turkey Dance. Happy Fall, everyone! Karen
