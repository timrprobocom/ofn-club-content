Fall typically means square dance lessons start; not wanting to be an exception we began new dancer’s lessons on September 9th, and are excited to welcome our new students.
 Oak Hills Squares provided a demo dance at the Cedar Hills Farmer’s market on September 14th, with an enthusiastic audience amid the produce.
 Seven members of our club visited Toedraggers anniversary dance on September 20th for some good experience dancing to other callers.  This was the first exposure some of our new dancers had to a larger dance, and they were pleasantly surprised.
 We are welcoming Renee Ruud as our caller on the third and fifth Monday beginning October 21st.  Lane Clem will continue to call and cue on the first, second and fourth weeks.
 On November 4th we will have a Guy Fawkes Dance as an alternative to a Halloween theme, in celebration of our British members.  No fireworks will be set off during the dance, but masks may be in evidence!  Photos of the festivities will be posted with our next report.
 We have an exciting announcement!  On April 1, 2019, a guy and a gal met at our class; in September, they (Mark and Dee), announced they were getting married on October 5th!  Our caller, Lane Clem, taught a beginning dance lesson to those who attended the wedding reception.  How fun!
We also celebrated them after the September 30th class, with cake, balloons, party lights, and many good wishes.
 Please join TVC’s newest club on Mondays from 6:30 to 8:30. The first hour will be the lesson for new dancers (we always welcome angels), and mainstream dancing with phase two rounds will follow for the second hour.  Square dancing attire is encouraged, but optional on the first Monday of every month, when the dance is all singing calls.
 Let’s keep on dancing!
  Marie Clem
