The Toe’s enjoyed our 44th Anniversary dance so much, and it was due in a very large part to all 97 of our wonderful square dance friends that came to celebrate with us!  Thank You, we so appreciated it!
 Our lessons are progressing on Wednesday evenings at 7:00. We have 8-10 students who all seem to be having a good time.  All Angels are welcome to bring a student a join us in the fun.
 November 1st is our “Fall Festival” dance.  Please bring canned food donations.  November 15th will be a regular dance.
 Please join us as caller KC Curtis calls and Bev Flint cues. See you soon.
