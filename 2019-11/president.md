Welcome to fall and to our main season of lessons!

As we go further into lesson season, we should take a look at how we are doing as a club and as “angels”. Angels are the wonderful people who volunteer their time to ensure that a class has the best possible learning experience. They provide the new class members with their first real look at the club. How angels behave and treat the new dancers, other angels, and visitors will affect class members' decisions whether or not to join our club.

Angels are also role models. No matter what the instructor and club try to communicate to the students concerning etiquette, attitudes, or styling, class members inevitably take their cues from what they see the angels doing. So it is important that angels be extra careful to provide good role models. Smile, be enthusiastic, and enjoy the dancing. Be friendly, courteous, and gentle. This is sometimes said than done, especially if it has been a long day. And, let's be honest, some of us have personal agendas, perhaps disagreements with club policies or less-than-cordial relations with specific club members that are out of place here and must be put aside.

Although most of us do the right things instinctively the majority of the time it can't hurt to reiterate certain points. The following advice for angels has been extracted from several sources, including articles in square dance publications and handouts prepared for other clubs.

ANGELS ARE NOT TEACHERS

*	This is perhaps the most common misconception that causes problems. The primary teaching function of an angel is to teach by example. To be in the right place at the right time. One important thing you can do is to establish handholds after every move. This not only helps the students maintain their orientation in the square, it is a very good habit to develop.
*	It is always tempting to explain something your square is not getting and the students will often ask you to do this -- BUT YOU MUST RESIST. It diverts the student's attention from the teacher and one of the most important things to learn in beginner class is to listen to the teacher/caller. Sometimes you can clarify a simple point for students between tips; this is fine, but not while the caller is at the microphone.
*	Another difficult point is just HOW MUCH HELP you should give in getting dancers into the right place. Dancers, after all, must learn to do the moves on their own. To gently guide someone through a maneuver if they have a momentary lapse of memory might be okay and sometimes one can help by indicating nonverbally where a person should go. But we accomplish little by pushing or pulling a dancer through an action when he or she doesn't know what was supposed to have been done.
*	It is better to let a square break down rather than to use too much force getting people into the right place. Broken down squares are an indication to the instructor that the dancers are having problems. Do be sure the teacher is aware of problems, raise your hand if necessary and ask the teacher to explain something if your square is having trouble.
*	Be careful, however, not to embarrass any dancer by the way you ask for help. It is much better to say that "the square is not getting" a certain move rather than saying "Steve isn't getting" a certain move.
*	Do encourage students. Let them know that all new dancers make mistakes and that things get better with practice. Also, angels do make mistakes too. It is good to admit to them cheerfully as it makes the students less tense about their own mistakes.

So, as we go out to lessons and our new dancer dances let us make sure that we Square Up With Everyone -- not just a few friends. Seek out the weaker students/dancers and ask them to dance with you. Make sure that students are not sitting out because angels are dancing. Make sure that we as angels and experienced dancers are having fun and being encouraging – this will help make lessons and dances fun for our newer students and dancers.
