The new classes are going well on Thursdays; with lots of enthusiasm and fun. The students celebrated their 1st plateau on Oct 10th.  
We could use some Angels - especially men (or those that dance left handed). 
We have a small group of dancers doing the Mainstream Workshop & Plus class  - but everyone has fun.
We were dark for the Circle N Square birthday dance - and what a GREAT time!!!! The hall was hoppin' - thanks to Eric Henerlau & Rikki Lobato!! Congrats on 65 years!!

Our October dance was small - but everyone had a great time with Chuck & Sarge - and there were many donations for Coats For Kids as well as the Rogue Valley Humane Society - thank you to everyone that donated!!  We were dark for the 3rd Saturday dance for the Potato Festival - and I am sure everyone had a good time that attended.
