This is part two of a two-part series on dancer safety.

## Part 2: Hall Safety

We all have a tendency to regard square dancing, round dancing
and clogging as completely safe in regards to the location of the
dances. Would we react the same if this was a store, our work or anywhere
else? We get bombarded by news reports of attacks and robberies all
the time. Do we even think these could happen to dancers or our dance
locations?

25 years ago, I never thought twice about being at a grange hall by myself
to decorate for a dance and I would often leave the door open. Now, if I'm
by myself at a hall, I make sure that the hall door is closed and locked.

Often our dance halls are off by themselves with no other buildings
close by. They also tend to have landscaping that includes bushes around
the building and poor outside lighting that leaves vast areas dark at
night. This is everything that the police warn against. Would we approach
any other unknown location without looking for places someone could hide?

How often do we look at the traffic pattern, both foot and vehicle, around our hall?

We leave hall doors unlocked during dances and lessons and encourage
people passing to stop in, watch and ask questions.

We all need to be aware of the hall we are in: what is the traffic
like? Where is it located? What is the lighting like? What is the
landscaping like?

Some of the things we can do to protect ourselves, other dancers and our facility include:

* Contact the local law enforcement and ask for a safety evaluation of the outside of the facility. What would they recommend for visibility?
* Is there anything able to be done about lighting? Even just a couple of portable spot lights set up outside at night would help with seeing in the parking area.
* Post notices and signs inside the facility to remind people to lock vehicles, put purses where they can keep an eye on them.
* Keep tripping hazards to a minimum -- have someone who can go out and do a "branch/deadfall" pick-up patrol after windstorms.
* Make sure hand railings are in good repair.
* Try to maintain sidewalks, steps and porches to avoid tripping problems.
* Help facility with maintenance of bushes and shrubs around building. Even if your club doesn't own or belong to the group owning the hall you can offer to trim and haul away trimmings.
* Make sure that no one is all by themselves locking up. There should be at least 2 to lock up. You don't want someone stranded for any reason.
* Have people willing to walk others to their vehicles especially if you are one of the halls further out in rural areas with minimal lighting.

Dancing and safety both on the floor and in the hall is the responsibility
of both the dancers and the club. We all have things that we really
should work on and be aware of. Please be aware of surroundings and
others and don't be afraid or unwilling to speak up -- by
speaking up, you might be speaking for more than just yourself and you
might be keeping a future problem from happening.

title: Music Licensing
---
Licensing of music for performance at our dances has long been a source of great confusion.  The major caller and cuer organizations have negotiated blanket licenses to keep their members in compliance, but there is still confusion.

Ever since the BMI/ASCAP licensing negotiations began in the early 1990s, there has been a guiding principle that, as long as one performer was licensed, his or her license would cover all performers at the dance.  As long as the caller was licensed, the cuer did not need to be, and guest callers and cuers would also be covered.

Things have grown more complicated in the last couple of years with the addition of SESAC, the third major licensing organization.  Roundalab has negotiated a blanket license with SESAC, and after reviewing the contracts, Roundalab's attorney has issued an opinion that any performer who is on stage and performing with music must be licensed to play that music, contradicting the long held "one license covers" principle.

This is a significant issue with uncomfortable implications.  SESAC is mostly an issue for round dance cuers, because they use radio-ready versions of popular songs, whereas square dance callers have to use music especially arranged for the timing.  Callerlab has chosen not to get a blanket contract with SESAC, and they continue to maintain the original "one license covers all" position.

In any case, it is prudent for clubs to have an occasional conversation with their callers and cuers about licensing.  The licensing companies do have well-dressed teams of lawyers scanning the internet looking for violations, and they have occasionally contacted and visited clubs to ensure compliance.  When new cuers are placed on the program, you need to make sure they have appropriate licensing for all of the music used in the program.

The Federation has licenses with all three organizations to cover our festivals, so any performance at Mid-Winter or Summer Festival is covered.
