River City Dancers are once again mourning the death of a beloved member. It is with great sadness that we report the loss of Richard George who died on Tuesday September 24. He, with his wife Caroline, were our former treasurer couple. Richard was a joy to be around and is greatly missed.

Our students are doing well at lessons and we will be having a new dancer jamboree at our first dance in November on November 9. We will also be honoring our veterans at this dance with the presentation of the “Quilts of Honor” to those who have served in military service. We will also be having an” experienced clothing” sale at that time. Hope you will come join us and bring your students.

We dance every second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community Center at 42nd and Jackson in Milwaukie. Darrell Kalmbach and Tami Helms are our caller and cuer and we love having company. Come dance with us.
