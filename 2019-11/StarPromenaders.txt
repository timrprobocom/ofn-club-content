We are all looking forward to Diamond Lake Festival in 2020. We will have a real "TRIFECTA" and a bonus with three callers of National Status. We will have Mike Sikorsky, Michael Kellogg and Mike Haworth, with the bonus of Rikki Lobato as the featured cuer.

The next "Game Night" will tentatively be November 8th, with a them of "Mexican" for the potluck to celebrate the game most of us play. Come out and join us. If you don't play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on.

Phil Ramey started a new "Plus" class on Monday, September 9th from 630-830pm. There were two squares turned out to either learn plus or brush up. This class is going very well. Everyone has a great time.

On November 13-15th, there will be "Experienced Square Dance Clothing" for sale at the hall. Come on down and find something you absolutely cannot live without.

On November 15, there will be another "Back to Basics" Dance. Dean Black will be the caller.

Then on November 21, put your appetite on and come join the Stars Class for a Thanksgiving Potluck. Check out the flyer to see the designations for what food to bring. Come on out and do like the rest of us, and eat too much.  Then on November 23rd is the club Thanksgiving Dance.

Bow to your partner, your corner too

See you in a square!
