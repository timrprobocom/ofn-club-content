By the time you read this, the club may be done with waltz review and into Cha review for a few weeks. The Rumba class is doing well and progressing nicely.

We are discussing the possibility of doing a showcase for Mid-Winter Showcase of Rounds. Just canâ€™t decide on what kind of rhythm to do, at least at our last class it came out to a tie. Guess we will find out later.

There is always room for more on the dance floor, so come and join us for some dancing and fellowship.   Marilyn Schmit
