We have started lessons and have two new students. Thomas is finishing up with his class the last half hour of lessons and his students are angeling for Leonard's class.

Thomas filled in as caller for our October dance since Leonard was out of town. He didn't have a lot of Halloween theme songs, but he did have a good variety.

Our ham dinner dance is November 8. Check out our flyer for more information. See you at a dance soon. Petrina Buchheit
