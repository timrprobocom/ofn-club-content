In September our dances returned to our normal schedule.  Thank you to all who join us and make our dance floor full.  Even as Autumn is upon us,  we have been pleased to have air conditioning on those end of summer warm nights.  September we ease from casual attire of the summer with our crazy tee shirt dance...I must go shopping for next year, where DO they find those shirts?
 You know, all clubs not just dancing, are having a struggle with membership.  As R Square D prepared for our annual campout in Skamokawa I realized the connection. As a club we were gathering together as friends, we didn't dance or conduct business (ok, just a little business) the club is/was a social connection.  As times change clubs do not have the same significance in our social lives as they once did.  I think it is really important to understand this as we structure our dancing in the future.
 Speaking of future, Vets!  Come dance for free on our November 8th dance.  R Square D would like to honor you.  It was a precious moment last year when all the Vets came forward for a picture.  Makes me thankful.
 Speaking of thankful, November 23rd will be our Thanksgiving dance.
