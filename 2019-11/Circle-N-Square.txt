Greetings from Yreka
Thank you doesn't seem to be adequate for the success and support we got for our 65th birthday dance, but until I think of another wau to say it, THANK YOU TO ALL. Our featured Caller and Cuer put on a great program. Keeping everyone moving, thinking, and having a great time. Also a big thanks to the decorating committee, the hall looked inviting and great! The raffle of the custom necklace was also a success, Ron Hayes, our club's past prez won the necklace. FYI the lost money was claimed and returned. We are making plans for next year, I have contacted callers about calling our 66th birthday, as well as our annual Gold Diggers. I will keep you updated when I get confirmations. On a different note, I was asked, and Sherrie too, (not sure about other members) if we were going to hold next year's birthday dance in Medford in cooperation with the R.V. Rendezvous. Simply put NO. In my simple mind this would be the equivalent to holding the annual Diamond Lake Fest at Crater Lake, or Boatnik at Roseburg. I want to thank Phil and the Star Promenaders for inviting me up to call, I am looking forward to calling again in November. Elaine has agreed to cue rounds for us weather providing. But if the weather is bad or questionable we may not offer rounds. As always we welcome all dancers to join us at any time. Thank you again for your continued support.
See you on the floor!
