October has been a busy month for the Stars.  We have seen the early retirement of our beloved Cuer Jeanine Norden for health reasons, we had our semi annual General meeting, and hosted two dances. Watch our Facebook posts to see who our guest cuers will be for the rest of 2019. There will be a rotation of cuers so it should be fun and interesting for all of the Round dancers. 
Mainstream lessons are progressing nicely. The dancers have learned almost 50 calls!!! They will be more than ready for all of the New Dancers Dances.

November brings us three dances, our regular first and third Friday dances and a fifth Friday Plus dance on November 29. Our New Dancer Dance will be on December 20 with a Christmas theme and there will also be Resale Clothing at that dance.  Mark your calendar for our New Year's Eve dance at the VFW Hall again this year.  Randy Dibble will call and Jeanine Norden will cue the dance for us. Cost will be $8.00. See Ronda, Sheila, Terry or Lanie for ticket information. See you on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
