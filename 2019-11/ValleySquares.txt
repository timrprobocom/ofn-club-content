Our November 16th dance theme is "Thankful" celebrating Thanksgiving with Craig Abercrombie calling and Connie Clark cueing.  We dance 7-8:30 pm Mainstream or floor level, announcements at 8:30 pm then 8:30 pm to end of dance is Plus.  Sometimes we stop at 9:30 pm, sometimes we go longer.  It just depends on our dancers choice.
