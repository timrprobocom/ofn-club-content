We had three dances in September, two of them called by live callers, Dan Nordbye and Kris Jensen from Albuquerque, NM  We love having live callers especially ones who can call like these two can.  Kris had to do double duty—she filled out the second square so seven of us did not have to sit out off and on for the two hour session.  Dan did a bit of workshopping on some calls we were having trouble with.  We won’t be seeing him again until next year, but Kris will be joining us on November 24, 2019.  Prior to that, on Nov. 10 we will possibly have an advanced dance to recorded tips in Hall B at 2095 Yolanda Ave., Springfield.  We often have two squares these days although sometimes we run short.  Please check our website at CAS-SD.yolasite.com for our tentative schedule of dances.  To be sure we are dancing on any given Sunday, be sure to call (541) 741-4149 to check.
