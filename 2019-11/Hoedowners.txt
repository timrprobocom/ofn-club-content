On September 10th we began our fall Mainstream lessons. The attendance was good and has continued to climb each week.  We have new and experienced dancers.  Bravo!  Daryl is a remarkable instructor and has everyone squared up and dancing.  Lessons continue so come join us and brush up.
 September disappeared in my rain spattered rear view mirror which made our Farmer’s Market Dance on the 14th all the more enjoyable.  Those endless fall afternoons with the golden autumn sunshine disappeared into the low, wet clouds of early winter but we were lucky and enjoyed the last of the summer’s fruits and veggies.  We celebrated, feasted and danced.  Hope you joined us.
 We had two fun filled visitations in September to the Toe Draggers and Tri-Squares for their anniversary dances.  Out came our bright green vests advertising Summer Festival 2020 in Seaside.
 Sept 28th was our Callers Choice Dance.  Daryl does like to remind us that every song is caller’s choice.
 Shiver me timbers and batten down the hatches!  The Hoedowners will be having their Pirates Booty Dance on November 9th.  There will be treasure.
 November 23rd is the famous Turkey Toss Dance.  Everyone gets a chance to toss a bag of beans and take home a turkey.
