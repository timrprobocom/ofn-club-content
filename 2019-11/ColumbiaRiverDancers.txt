 November.  Holy cow where did the year go?  Seems like yesterday when we were hosting the New Year's eve Dance.  Well, we were dark the last week in September as the Cloggers took over the Hazel Dell Grange as they do every year.  Heard it was a real floor pounder.  Our November 12th dance will be in honor of Veteran's Day.  We will have Mark Wheeler calling and Julie Stiers Cueing. 
 As Thanksgiving is late this year our 4th Saturday Dance is before we eat that big turkey dinner so it we will not have our usual Turkey Burn-off dance but we plan to have a great time with our outstanding club caller, Jim Hattrick.  We will have plus from 7-8 and mainstream from 8-?.  It will be a good time to stop and relax before jumping again into the Christmas shopping.  We look forward to seeing you in a square.  Also, just to remind some clubs it might be a time to come get your banner back.
