We kicked off our new dance season with a Sock Hop called by Jim Hattrick and cued by Jackie Gale.  Bill Gale was on hand but not allowed to dance yet.  He is still wearing a neck brace and says he has good days as well as bad days.  Joy Pitts, our treasurer, did a great job of decorating as always.  She finds fun props and even had hung a plastic sheet showing people at a drive in restaurant with faces cut out so one could get one’s photo taken looking like a teenager again.  Lots participated.  There were many wearing over-sized white shirts with jeans rolled up, saddle shoes, tennis shoes and pony tails.  A couple of us wore our poodle skirts.  Jim brought along two of his protégées: Mark Wheeler and Melissa from Vancouver.  Melissa is just starting to learn but did a great job considering how brand new she is.  We love Mark’s calling andhis great singing voice.  What a fun night that was and topped off by root beer floats provided by Joy Pitts.  Yum!  Great calling and harkening back to the 50’s!  What a great combination.
On Sept. 27 we had Dan Nordbye calling and Jackie Gale cueing.   What a fun dance but for many reasons we only had three squares on the floor.  This was the last time we would have Dan calling for us this dance year.  We don’t know exactly when we will be able to get him back.  However, he will be calling in Mesa this winter if you want to fly down and dance to him!  Otherwise, he will return in Oregon and be calling at various places north of here throughout the late spring and summer months.  I understand he’ll be at nationals in Spokane too next June.
Hope to see you join us when you can.
