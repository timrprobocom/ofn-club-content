We just had our annual Talk like a Pirate dance which is always great fun. We also have lots of fun dances on the Horizon on the first and third Fridays of the month. We do pre-rounds on the first Friday and pre-plus on the third Friday and try to throw in an easy line dance teach also.

New dancer classes have started and so far our ladies outnumber the men, so gents, if you would like to angel, come on over on Tuesday evenings at 7:00 at the Albany IOOF Hall and join us. Sandy
