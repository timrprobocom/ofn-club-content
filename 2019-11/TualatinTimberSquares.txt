The Tualatin Timber Squares have decided to go dark through January so that our members can angel at the Toe Draggers Mainstream lessons on Wednesday nights.  We will resume our regular 2nd and 4th Wednesday night dances at the Winona Grange in February.  Until that time, we will see you either at the Toe Draggers or around in a square.
