March 2nd is our "Time Travel Dance" as we will be springing forward with our clocks.  Scott Zinser will be our caller.  The March 16th dance is "St Patrick's Day" (be sure to wear green) with Mark Wheeler calling.  We want to thank all our callers for February and March for donating their time to help keep Valley Squares going.  Daryl Clendenin, Renee Ruud, Craig Abercrombie, Scott Zinser and Mark Wheeler.  They are super heroes to us.  
 Our class is coming along fine.  It's good to see so many young people dancing, 15 in their middle twenties and 4 teens.  Makes you feel so good dancing and even watching them.  
 Don't forget we have changes our dance night agenda, 7-8 pm Plus, 8-10 pm Mainstream.  And, don't forget April 6th, Valley Squares 70th Anniversary Dance.
 See you in a square, Yellowrock,
  Carolene Siebert
