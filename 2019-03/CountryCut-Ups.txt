March is known as the windy month. It is blowing in our pirate play on the ship the Foul Wind! Come and join us on Sunday, March 17th from 2 to 5 PM for another Mystery Play/Dance/Dinner.  There will be laughs, good dancing and good food! Get your tickets from any of the Crazy 8 Players. Tickets are limited to 100 people at $18 for the whole thing. The proceeds will go to finish paying off our outdoor dance floor at the Boring Barn.

March also brings our elections, so stay tuned next month to find out who’s in charge for the coming year. We have a great club and it is always a fun time to dance with the Cut-Ups. We dance on the 1st and 4th Saturday nights, and don’t forget we have a 5th Saturday dance in March. These are usually all plus, but to honor our recent graduating mainstream class, this dance will be mixed mainstream and plus. Hope to see you there!
