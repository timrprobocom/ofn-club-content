Our caller Bruce Lowther and wife Judy were out of town on February 1 so the Girls Night Out called for our dance. Our chocolate dance was on February 15. We always love the chocolate dance.

The parking lot behind the IOOF Hall has been graded and re-graveled so lots more parking is available, so come join us as we'd love to have you. Remember, we dance pre-rounds on the first Friday and pre-plus on the third Friday. Sandy
