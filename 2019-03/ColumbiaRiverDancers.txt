Four years ago a group got together and decided that Vancouver should have another square dance club.  On March 9th the Columbia River Dancers will have its four year anniversary dance with Adam Christman coming over from Spokane to be our caller and cuer.  The club has grown in those years.  The first 50 attendees will receive a 4-year dangle.  
 We had 18 members dining together while at the Mid-Winter Festival in Albany.  Two members hosted a get together prior to the dance Friday, members shared stories over dinner, and some of us tried the advanced workshop.  
 Our only downer was when we learned that long-time dancer, Sharon Driscoll, had slipped and was in a Corvallis hospital with a broken femur.  Doctors operated on Sunday and assured her that in time she could be dancing again.  
 Our second dance on March 23rd will feature our esteemed caller Jim Hattrick calling and cueing.  
 Remember, when you veer not only do you go to the side you also go forward.
