We are excited to have 17 new club members, especially a group with so much enthusiasm who are adding so much zest to our club and to the square dance family. Welcome aboard!  Everyone agrees that Salem Hospital was an ideal venue for our lessons, and we plan to return there next fall. Start now to recruit students for Mainstream Lessons which will begin in early September.  

All IWW Members are encouraged to attend the Annual Meeting and Potluck at 2:00 pm on Sunday, March 17, Polk County Fairgrounds. Preparations are well underway for the April 26 – 28 Hillbilly/HeeHaw Koast Krash at Yachats Inn – always a great time.. 

Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays of each month at Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall.  Especially be sure to come to our special March 9 IWW Birthday Dance and April 13 Easter Dance. Dee and Bert Mackaman
