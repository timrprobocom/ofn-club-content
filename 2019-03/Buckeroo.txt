We hope you all had as much fun as we did at the Mid-Winter Festival! It is so much fun to see so many dancers all together enjoying this pastime that we all love! It is also fun to catch up with friends that we have not seen in awhile.

Here at the barn, things are sure busy. We have been doing some cleaning and rearranging and things are looking great! If you have not been here recently, come have a look!

Rememberâ€¦ we are just a short drive south from the Portland area, so plan to join us in the near future. We dance the first and third Saturdays and always enjoy having visitors. We have members of all ages and are a family friendly club.

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
