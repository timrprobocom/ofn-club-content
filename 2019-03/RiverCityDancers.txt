Many of our members attended Mid-Winter festival in Albany in January and had a great time. We began February with our Valentine’s dance on February 9., followed by our regular dance the next Saturday.  March 1 and 2 , was our annual beach trip weekend in Lincoln  City.
Now is the time to bring out that poodle skirt and Bobby socks, pedal pushers or tee shirts and “cool dude” outfits . Our fabulous 50’s dance is coming April 13. We will be rocking. 

There is always something fun going on at River City Dancers and we hope you will join us. We dance in Milwaukie at 42nd and Jackson Street every second and third Saturday.
