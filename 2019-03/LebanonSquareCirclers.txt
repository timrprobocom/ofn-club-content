On Sunday, January 20, 2019, the Lebanon Square Circlers celebrated 70 years of dancing with a gala event at the IOOF Hall in Lebanon, Oregon. Our club is the second oldest in Oregon. Metal stars, dancers, and notes decorated the hall, as well as over 100 balloons. Each balloon contained a prize and was sold to the dancers. Callers included Charlotte Jeskey, guest caller Jim Voll and cuer Jackie Gale. Music was featured from each decade and strawberry shortcake was served at the break time. About 100 dancers enjoyed this fantastic dance and we also graduated six new dancers following the dance.   

The Lebanon Square Circlers had a regular dance on February 2 and its Sweetheart Dance on February 16.  We will help the Sweet Home Squarenaders celebrate their Birthday on February 9 and the Corvallis Squares on February 23.  It is truly a busy dance month.   

The Lebanon Square Circlers will have its Hippie Dance on March 3 with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  "Girls Night Out" will be calling on March 17.  Our Mystery Trip is scheduled for March 31. Plans and activities for the June Strawberry Festival are underway. We are hoping to see lots of dancers for our festival. See you in a square! Marilyn York
