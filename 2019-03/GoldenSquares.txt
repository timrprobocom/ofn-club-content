Hello Dancers â€“ Our attendance has been down due to travels, illnesses and work schedules. We sure could use some visits!  Randy Dibble is our caller and we have guest cuers. I will try to get in and update the OFN when I get the cuer list from our President. We have pre-rounds at 7:00 and mainstream at 7:30, with third tip as plus.
We do have a Pie Night coming up on April 29 so that is a good one to visit.  Although, Perrin just brought a great blueberry pie to the dance the other Monday. Stay warm and drive safe out there.  Hope to see you! Teija
