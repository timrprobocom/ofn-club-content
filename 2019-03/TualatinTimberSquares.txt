The Tualatin Timber Squares have decided to go back to holding dances instead of lessons.  These will be every 2nd and 4th Wednesday nights from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Winona Grange in Tualatin.  Refreshments will be served after each dance.  Our dances in February and March are on the 13th and the 27th, each month.  If we have less than a square at any of our dances, we may either end the dance early or cancel the dance.  We had one drop-in student at our first lesson and no students at our second lesson, so we decided to instead hold dances for the foreseeable future, for now.
 At our last dance on January 23rd, we had a group of visitors from the Toe Draggers, including two of their new students who had just graduated from their lessons.  They did really well!  We had a lot of fun at this dance with them.
 We welcome all new dancers at all levels!  If any of our visiting new dancers have trouble with some of the moves, our caller, Janienne, will gladly workshop the moves with the dancers.  
 See you around in a square.
