March has five Fridays, so the Hayshakers will hold two Square Dances with Mark Wheeler calling on Friday the 15th and 29th.  The Wave Steppers in Garibaldi resume dancing in March, so weâ€™ll be visiting them monthly beginning on Saturday March 9th.
 The Hayshakers plan to hold Square Dance lessons beginning Sunday March 10th at 3:00 p.m. in the Pacific Grange with Mark Wheeler instructing.
 Be sure to visit the hayshakers.org website which changes every month with new embedded animations to study (the only one in Oregon).
