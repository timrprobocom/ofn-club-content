The Birthday Dance, on February 23rd, was well attended. Richard Lane stepped in when we needed to find a substitute callers. The original Birthday Dance Caller was Ed Kremers from Magalia, CA. Unfortunately, Magalia is in the middle of the area of the "Camp Fire." He lost everything in that disaster. We appreciate Richard for helping us and our thoughts and prayers go to Ed and his family. He will come and call for us in the future, when he recovers from the trauma he has suffered.

The next "Game Night" is March 15th. What a lot of fun we have. Come out and join us. It is a "Hoot." If you don't play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on or if there is some other "Game" you would like to play, let us know.  We are open to most any table game. We always have a potluck with a theme. This time it will be "Comfort Food."

Phil Ramey has been doing a Mainstream/Plus Workshop on Wednesdays to give everyone who feels a little shaky about some moves, a chance to come out and practice.  There are generally 2 squares plus (unless the weather throws us a curve ball). He says he may even attempt to throw in a little bit of Advanced. Not to worry - it will be easy Advanced. Come on out and enjoy a fun evening and maybe learn something.

Don't forget the March 23rd dance.  We are collecting clean, plush stuffed animals to donate to the Jackson County Sheriff's Department to give to children in stressful situations.  Please come out and help.  You will receive $1.00 off your dance fee with a donation of a stuffed animal. Thank you to all who contribute.

Motivate (that's Advanced)
See you in a square
