 Willamette Squares went dark for the month of January due to a conflict with the Winter Festival. However, they are back on track for February and beyond at their regular schedule on the fourth Saturday evening of each month. In the beginning of January they hosted their new dancer dance with a sizable turn out and plenty of enthusiasm. There was even a baby in a back pack experiencing dancing with his mom! Getting exposure on the floor early on, undoubtedly he will likely be a square dancer when he is grown. Willamette Squares is looking forward to the many dances in 2019. Jodee
