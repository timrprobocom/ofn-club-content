Feb 12 is the big day of our class graduation.  We’ve got a great crop of new students.  Jan 23 was a surprise birthday party for Gene Neils.  Little did we know that Gene intended to pay for everyone’s door donation.  That’s right.  Even though it was his birthday, he treated everyone to the dance!  He sure knows how to throw a party!  The split the pot came to an astounding $49!  

You should have been there.  Yes, you should come join us, for one never knows what will happen at our dances.
