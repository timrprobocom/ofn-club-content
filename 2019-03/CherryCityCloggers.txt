As is true with many of the square dancers, Cherry City Cloggers also enjoyed a good time at Mid Winter. Several of our dancers attended. 

We held our semi-annual board meeting January 12 to discuss goals for our club going into 2019. Officers for this year remain the same as they were last year.

The 2018 INTRO TO CLOGGING Class was a huge success. Fourteen individuals registered for the September-December session held at the Salem Square Dance Center. Of these, one sadly withdrew for a medical reason but continues to pop in and out of class as our biggest fan. Eight enthusiastic graduates returned in January and are now official Cherry City Cloggers. Three dancers did not become members but have eager plans to return in September and start again. That is what happens when you try clog dancing â€“ you get hooked!  Georganne Pfnister
