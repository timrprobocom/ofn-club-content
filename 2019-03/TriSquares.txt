In January, fifteen members (about 1/2 of our club) attended Mid-Winter and had a great time.  We donated a beautiful garden-themed basket created by Alice Hendricks. 
 In March two dances are coming up: “Bit O’ the Irish” on Saturday, March 9, 7:30; and “Spring Fling” on Friday, March 22, 7:30; Terry Halley will be calling and Sandra Pinion cueing at both.  On Saturday the 16th we plan a visitation to the River City Dancers in Portland. 
 Although our Sunday Waltz lessons ended Feb.17, four Waltz workshops continue each Sunday through March 17th, From 2:00-3:15.  They are open to all dancers who would like to brush up on Waltz, with a cost of $4 at the door. 
 We will have a graduation ceremony for our Mainstream students on March 17th as well, from 3:30-5:30, with the usual challenging and crazy games making it fun!
