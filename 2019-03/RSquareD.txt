Off we go into 2019.  Remember when that year seemed like sci fi future?  Well, not so much we were dancing again as usual with the floor full of 4 squares throughout the night.  Thank you to our "regular visitors" who make our dances lots of fun.  First dance of the year we serve warm winter soups.  This is always a favorite treat.  Our tummies are warmed up before going home on a chilly night.  We were dark for the second dance so dancers could attend Mid-Winter Festival in Albany.  We hope you all had fun and will be back to join us again in February.
 March is St Paddy's day dance on the 8th, when there will be the wear in' o the green...a little early.  And, big 66th anniversary celebration this month on Saturday the 23rd!  Please come join in the celebration.
 Please remember that our dances are now ending at 9:30pm.  7-8 Plus and advanced rounds, 8-9:30pm Mainstream with rounds.  106 NW 8th, Kelso/Longview intersection on Ocean Beach Hwy.  Craig Abercrombie calling and Lonnie Sycks cueing.  Our website www.r-square-d.info is a great way to keep track of our club and events or friend us on Facebook.
