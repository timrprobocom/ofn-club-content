The annual TVC Presidents Meeting & Potluck was held on the evening of January 28th.  Over forty dancers, many having just returned from Mid-Winter, attended the event honoring current and past club Presidents.  Well over half of those present stood when current or previous club presidents were asked to do so.  The TVC wishes to thank all the presidents of the TVC Clubs for volunteering their time and efforts into this activity we all love. 
 TVC President, Mike St. Clair, announced the recipient of the Tualatin Valley Council “Recognition Award” for 2018.  This award is presented annually for outstanding service and special contribution to the square dance community within the TVC geographical area.  The TVC Recognition Award for 2018 was presented to Judy Schnase.  Judy, a long time member of the Sunset Promenaders, is well known to many within the TVC, as well as other Councils.  A very dedicated dancer, attending nearly every TVC and club Anniversary dance within the Council, she encourages her fellow members to attend as well.  Judy is a huge believer in visitations and works very hard to get support for this.  She is currently serving as Vice President of the TVC.  Congratulations to a very deserving person!
 Our next Council event is the Spring Fling Dance, held at the Hillsboro IOOF Hall on March 30th. This dance will feature Randy Dibble calling with Jeanine Norden cueing.  The dance begins with pre-rounds at 7:30 followed by Mainstream with rounds at 8:00. Every third tip will be Plus.  This dance is co-hosted by the Mix N' Mingle.
