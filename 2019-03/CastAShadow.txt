Cast-A Shadow is an Advanced (A-2) and Challenge (C-1) club in the southern Willamette Valley. The club dances on selected Sunday afternoons at the Emerald Square Dance Center (ESDC), 2095 Yolanda Street, Springfield, Oregon 97477 in Hall B behind the main hall. Dances are scheduled in advance, depending on caller and dancer availability (via an email survey of dancers). Sunday dances are primarily A-2 level; for information on the current schedule of dances and C-1 level dances, go to the club website:  http://cas-sd.yolasite.com.

In January we held no dances as we did not have enough interest on the 13th of January and the 4th weekend of course there was some good advanced dancing at Mid-Winter.  Several of our dancers were there to dance to the local and national callers and meet up with other advanced dancers from around the Northwest. 

We are looking forward to resuming our twice a month schedule of dancing (see our website for exact dates) to either recorded tips or live callers when we have one in the area.  Please come join us when you can.  In April we look forward to seeing some snowbirds return to dance with us.
