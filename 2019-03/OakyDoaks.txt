The Oaky Doaks hope that everyone who attended the mid-winter festival had a good time. What a fun way to get to dance with club members who are out of your normal council area. It was also nice to be able to dance to callers and cuers who you may not have had the chance to do otherwise as well. 

February started off weather wise with no problems but it sure did posed some possible problems for anyone wanting to celebrate Valentine’s Day. We had our Chocolate Dance early but would probably have had to change it to the Hot Chocolate Dance if the threat of snow and ice had appeared sooner. 

Our first dance in March, as you can see by our flier on the OFN, is our annual Reigning Cats and Dogs Dance. Here we join together and ask all the dancers attending to bring with them donations that will be collected for two charities, one for cats and one for dogs. A contest to see which of one will reign for the year is done by weighing the amount received for each. 

Here is a list of suggested donation items that were not on our flier. 

Donations of these items are always gratefully accepted –
* Cat Food
* Cat Treats
* Dog Food
* Dog Treats
* Food Dishes
* Cat Toys / Supplies
* Dog Toys / Supplies
* Animal Beds
* Costco Gift Card
* Cash Donation 

April will find the Oaky Doaks will be home at the Oak Grove Community Hall for the first Saturday dance only.  On the third Saturday of the April we will be going to the beach at Lincoln City. We invite all dancers to come join us at the Best Western – Landmark Inn on Highway 101. Anyone interested in staying with us for the weekend can get a special rate by contacting the hotel directly when making reservations. Just let them know they will be attending our dance there. To get the special rate reservations need to be made no later than April 1st.

Hope everyone stays safe and warm. 

See you on the dance floor.
