The Ramblers made their Oak Grove debut in January con mucho brío. Stephen Cole kept the joint hopping, and we were thrilled to welcome six of our newest dancers to their first social dance as full Mainstream dancers. Our February dance, featuring Anne Uebelacker, occurs after our deadline for this newsletter, but we’re sure it will be another barn-burner.
 
We’ll take the month of March off, to catch our breath, while some of our gang heads north to Seattle for the Puddletown Rain Festival (https://puddletownsquares.org/rain-festival-fly-in/). This is the analog to our Scares and Squares festival in the fall—October 25-27, 2019—for those looking for a high-energy hootenanny.
 
We’ll be back on the boards on April 13 at the Oak Grove Community Club, alternating Mainstream and Plus from 7:30-9:30. Richard Lane calling.
 
You can now mark your calendars for the remainder of 2019, all dances on second Saturday of the month:
May: Ian Craig (Graduation Dance)
June: Don Wood
July and August: dark
September: Kris Jensen
October: Richard Lane
November: Diana Wedel
December: Ian Craig.
 
SYIAS!
