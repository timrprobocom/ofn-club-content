### Publicity and Education

During our Mid-Winter Education Seminar, “Working Together – Helping Each Other”, we had 15 people participate in a positive discussion on how we can improve our class attendance and help with dancer retention.  The President of the Buckaroos, Bruce and Laura Knotts, and the Umpqua Area Council President, Frank and Rita Schuchard, were invited to attend the seminar to share why they think the Buckaroos have grown to be the largest club in Oregon.

For the following seminar summary, I’ve merged the Buckaroo’s observations with comments and suggestions from the other attendees.  Thank you to everyone who attended and participated.

Keep your conflicts away from the dance.  Your dance should be a fun place to attend, not a place to discuss politics, private information, controversial matters or to gossip.  Be honest when dealing with your dancers and each other.  Check your attitude at the door and keep your dances clean and fun.  

Open up your clubs to families.  Provide assistance for young families to take lessons by giving them an area to come and dance while providing a safe place for their underage youngsters to play quietly.  This is not a babysitting service, but consider putting in an area similar to a corral where you can put toys and books.  The kids go into the corral during the lessons or dance where parents can keep an eye on them.  If you have a dancer who isn’t dancing and enjoys children and you feel it is necessary, ask if they would be willing to sit close to the corral to help keep things smooth and quiet. Contact your local Homeschool Coordinator in your area.  Square dancing qualifies as a PE Credit for homeschoolers.  When the families bring their students, ask the parents if they would like to stay, too.   The Buckaroos are having great success with this and their club is actively growing.

Instead of giving free lessons, charge for your lessons, but apply a percentage of the fee to the student’s first club membership dues.  At the end of the lessons, the students’ dues are paid if they attended all of the lessons, and you have a new member.  You can also consider giving the students a free outfit if your dancers would like to share some of the clothing they are no longer using.  When the students graduate, immediately invite them back as angels.  Ask them to pay a minimal fee.  When the lessons are finished, the fee will be applied to their next year’s membership dues. After the first year as an angel, do not charge the angels.

If you have a guest drop in to visit who doesn’t dance, give them a short lesson during one of the tips.  Plant a seed – it may produce a dancer.  If you have a large number of kids who want to learn, consider teaching a “Blast Class” where a lot of moves are taught rapidly and in only a few sessions.  

Sponsor jamborees at your students’ level.  Encourage your students to attend other jamborees.  Attend with them and even offer to drive them to the jamborees.
Consider teaching “All Position Dancing”, especially if you have more of one sex in your lessons or club.  Buy pink and blue bracelets for your dancers to wear when learning All Position.  Have the dancer in the “girl’s” position wear the pink bracelet, while the dancer in the “boy’s” position wears the blue bracelet.  

Adults should never pick up and swing the kids.  This is inappropriate and can be scary for the child.  All dancers need to keep their feet on the floor, regardless of their age.  Ask permission from parents before hugging children.  Children and their parents need to feel that the square dance hall is a safe place for the youth or they will stop coming to your dance and may encourage friends to stay away.

If you have a group of younger or more energetic dancers in your club, consider setting aside an “Adventure” or “Tsunami Zone”.  Advertise this area as a high energy dance zone where different types of fun dancing can be allowed.  Also, if you have dancers who do not want to dance with kids or energetic dancers, suggest that they form squares with other adults only in an area away from the high energy dancers.  

Consider bringing line dancing into your clubs.  Line dancing can lead to square dancing and vice versa.  Line dancing allows people without partners to feel like they are a part of the group.  

Councils can help support clubs by planning visitations to the clubs within their council.  Pick special dances or Anniversary dances and then use social media and email to encourage dancers to support each other’s clubs.  We are not in competition with each other – we need to support each other.  Be excited when you are inviting your dancers or other clubs to participate – remember when you are making dance announcements you are the cheerleader for your club or council!  Be enthusiastic!!  Councils can also help put clubs together who are having trouble finding enough students to hold a class.  Combining lessons will help reduce the cost to any one club – work together and allow students to pick which club they’d like to join. Remember if just one student joins one club, we all gain.
Get involved with your students and new members.  Offer to pick them up for jamborees and dances.  Drive with them.  Plan no-host dinners before dances.  It might take a little effort, but the results will be worth it.

Remember to keep your dances fun and enthusiastic and be willing to try something new.  Be sure to share with us if your club is having success with similar or different ideas.  We’d enjoy hearing from you.
