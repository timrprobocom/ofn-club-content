The Wave Steppers’ first dance of 2019 will be Saturday, March 9th, on the dance floor at Garibaldi City Hall,107 sixth St. (at Acacia) in downtown Garibaldi, Oregon.  Our first dance of the year will feature the calling of Janienne Alexander and cueing by Connie Clark
 Garibaldi is nine miles north of Tillamook on US 101.  City Hall has a huge second-floor dance hall built for the old Firemen’s Balls.  The club has had square dances there since the building was built in 1948.
