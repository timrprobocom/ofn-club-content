Our next scheduled Fifth Saturday Dance is our area's annual benefit dance.  CCCA callers and cuers were asked to please call and cue, and we are happy to do that.  The beneficiary this year is Camp Alma which is located between Eugene and Florence off Highway 126.  It's primarily geared towards helping veteran's suffering from PTSD and other issues.  It's a wonderful "Thank you" to these veterans who have served us and our country.  You will find a lot of information at their web site.  Go to Camp Alma Oregon which will take you to their site.  It's pretty amazing all that they do for our veterans.

We encourage all dancers to join us Saturday, March 30 at 7:30PM for Pre-Rounds and 8:00PM for Square dancing with rounds. Please be generous with your donations for this worthy organization.  Thank you. 

Keep on dancing, calling and cueing for FUN
