By the time this news comes out, February will almost be behind us—many thanks to all who attended our Birthday Dance in February! It’s always a festive occasion.

This March will be a fun month as we welcome Spring and do some more dancing. We’re looking forward to our coast trip at Gleneden Beach Community Club and dancing both Friday and Saturday nights, the 8th and 9th. We want to mention again that all are welcome! This has been a longstanding tradition for the Corvallis Squares. For the Saturday lunch potluck there will be good humor and good food, and if you want, you can bring a joke to share! Happy Spring to all!  Karen
