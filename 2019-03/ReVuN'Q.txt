We started a new season of dance in our club the first Thursday of February. The first 45 minutes will be spent on adding (very slowly) new steps to those dancers who have danced Phase 2 and are ready to move up to Phase 3. By adding a couple moves each week, the list of dances you can enjoy will multiply weekly. So it will mean more floor time as the lessons go on. 
From 7:15 to 7:45 will be floor time in rhythms for all to dance and find out what you need to add or fix. From 7:45 to 8:30, the dancers will continue on with the Cha class and add more Phase 3-4 moves to what we have already had earlier in the season in the early class. It should be interesting to see what we get and how confused we can be. I already was earlier.
The late class will continue to work on the dances from Mid-Winter and get in preparation for the Spring Spectacular at the coast. They are enjoying the almost one on one since it is only three couples.
Hope you will come and join us and see what we are all about and getting the Phase 2 dancers ready to advance to intermediate level. Happy Spring! Marilyn Schmit
