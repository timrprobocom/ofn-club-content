Our January dance was lots of fun! The theme was “Favorite Disney Characters”. We had four mice, all with different ears, Goofy and Mary Poppins. Pictures have been posted on Facebook. We had three visitors from Lebanon Square Circlers and two squares on the floor. Sandra Pinion used several Disney songs for her Rounds. Leonard Snodgrass called to "The Bear Necessities", which included a move called “the Bear thing” reminding us of Brian Hotchkies from Australia who called at Mid-Winter several years ago. Leonard followed that with “Vertical Expressions” and yodeled to “O Lonesome Me”. Much laughter rocked the floor! After the dance we celebrated Leonard's birthday. Yes, we have fun at our dances.
