We had a great time at our Birthday dance in February. Thanks to all who came out to celebrate with us.

Please come out to join our Fundraiser Dance on March 3 to help out the Silver Knights and Silver Dragons. We are having a "Mad Science Lab" theme for the dance and the kids are asking people to come dressed as "mad scientists". We will have a silent auction and a basket raffle as well as drawing for the winners for the cash raffle. Check out our flyer for more information.

We are starting practice for the Teen Festival and we will have two teams this year.
Mom says she is still looking for volunteers for Teen Festival. See you at a dance soon. Petrina Buchheit
