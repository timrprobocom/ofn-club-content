Are you feeling lucky?  The Happy Hoppers have designated an occasional dance as a “Lucky Dance.”  What is a “Lucky Dance?”  It’s a dance where all members and guests will have free admission.  The dates of a “Lucky Dance” will be random and known only to the Amundsons and the Chases.  Thus, it will be a “Lucky Dance” for attendees since there will be no door donation for that night.  In addition to the “Lucky Dances,” the Hoppers have reduced the door donation from $6.00 to $5.00.  How much better can it get?  Well, the answer is having a great caller, Jim Hattrick, dancing with friendly square dancers, enjoying the fellowship of old and new friends, and an inexpensive night out certainly can’t be beat.

	January was the start of a new session of lessons.  We were delighted to have 21 new students who have continued to be enthusiastic about learning to square dance.  Fortunately, many of our Hopper members come every Monday night to angel these beginning dancers.  The angels really make it easier for students to understand and practice new moves.   We are looking forward to helping them reach the mainstream level so they can be out dancing enjoying this terrific activity.

     Be sure to mark your calendars.  On May 4th the Hoppers will celebrate their 60th anniversary with a dance that is themed “May the Fourth be With You.”  The theme is a play on the date of the dance, the 4th, which somehow encourages images of “Star Wars.”  It should be a unique and fun dance.  Guests and members may feel free to wear Star War character costumes.  The costumes are optional for those people who enjoy getting into the mood of the theme.  It should be a celebration you won’t want to miss.
