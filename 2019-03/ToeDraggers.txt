Mid-Winter is in the books, and a big Congratulations to Ferrous & Karen Steinka, they were the recipients of the Randall Award. 
 Our beautiful quilt that we’ve been working on to benefit cancer research made its debut at Mid-Winter, and sold $60 in tickets so far.  A picture of the quilt will be visiting clubs in the area, with a drawing being held at the Toe’s “Man Enough To Wear Pink” Dance, held on Oct 6th.
 The hall we dance in, Kinton Grange, would like to invite everyone to a “Spring Celebration Ham Dinner & Bazaar” April 28th from noon-4:00.  This is a fundraiser to keep this community building operational. 
 Be sure to join us for our “Everything’s just Ducky” dance on March 1st. 7:30 pre-rounds.  Then on March 15th, is our Leprechaun Jig dance, 7:30 pre-plus.
 We’d love to see you, come dance with the Toe’s.
