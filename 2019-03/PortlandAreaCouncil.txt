Sometimes people ask what the purpose of an area council is.  I liken it to a county government which supports its cities (clubs) through publicity, organization and advice to the clubs within our domain.  If you would like to support square and round dancing at something other than the club level, we invite you to to attend and participate in our monthly meetings.  We meet the third Monday of each month, at the Oak Grove Community Club, 7:30 PM.  If you'd like to run for an office, you can write me at semichasse@gmail.com.
