The Charlies graduated their September Mainstream Class on February 14th! What a great group of enthusiastic and fun dancers!! Our January Mainstream class is full of fun - another great group of dancers having a blast!!

We will be starting a Mainstream & Plus Funshop on February 21st. 630 for Mainstream and 8pm for Plus - please come support and improve your dancing skills!!

February dances were full of fun with our annual Chili cookoff on February 2nd and Sweetheart Ball on February 16th.
Lots of smiles on the 2nd as our famous Charlie Cheerleaders entertained the dancers and Chuck and Rikki kept the dancers moving all nite. On the 16th we had a special guest caller - Roger Putzler is always great fun!! Thanks to the Star Promenaders for coming to visit. 

March brings two great dances  - on the 2nd we will have Phil & Rikki doing the honors - this will be a Mainstream and Plus dance. On the 16th we will have Guest Caller Richard Lane calling and Bob Dingman cueing - we will start a little earlier with Advanced at 6pm and have alternating Plus & Mainstream throughout the nite - with rounds starting at 7pm.

Reminder that - for the most part - our dances now start at 7pm with Pre Rounds and 730 for squares (except when we have Advanced).

We are busy planning for a great Boatnik Festival with the fabulous Joe Saltel and TJ (Bruce) Chadd - what a great party it will be!  Get your ribbons!!!
