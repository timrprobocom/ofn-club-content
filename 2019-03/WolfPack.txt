We just celebrated 21 years as a club at the beginning of February. The club founder Larry DuPray has been in the hospital dealing with heart issues and had major heart surgery but is on the mend.

We still need dancers to join us on the 1st and 4th Saturdays of the month with callers Sandy Harris 1st Sat and Lennie Ludiker 4th Saturday and cuer Christina Corelli for both dances.
