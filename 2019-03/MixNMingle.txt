Randy Dibble's New Year's resolution is to call shorter tips.  Since he has always been known for longer ones, we are noticing the difference.  We are happy to have him call whatever length tips he wants.  
 You can check when he calls for the TVC dance March 30th at Hillsboro's IOOF Hall, with Jeanine Norden cuing.  Our club has put together a tasty basket to bid on.  We hope that there will be a good turnout for a fun-filled evening.
