Hi Everyone,
Don't forget the Council Dance on March 29th. It will be held in Yreka and will be the last square dance event held at the Greenhorn Grange. We would like to see a "HUGE" turnout to support this club and their dancers.  Come on, gang, let's go to Yreka. Dean Black is calling and Elaine Funk is cueing. Circle N Square are Hosts for this dance, Charlie's are Greeters and Stars are in charge of door prizes. The Council is Treasurer.

The Council meeting that was scheduled for February, as moved to March due to adverse weather conditions.

Don't forget - on May 4th & 5th, the State Federation Meeting is in our Council. The May 4th Officer/Delegate meeting will be held at 2385 Table Rock Rd. The "Crock Pot" potluck will be held from 5:45 to 6:30 at the Rogue Valley Square Dance Center on Table Rock Rd. The May 5th meeting will be at the Rogue Valley Square Dance Center at 9am. Check with your representative and sign up or if you have a favorite crock pot meal, bring it along. There is never too much food. We will need main dishes, side dishes and desserts.

The next Council meeting (hopefully) will be March 5th at Round Table Pizza in Poplar Square.

Lois & Lorri
