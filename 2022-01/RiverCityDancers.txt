We hope everyone had a happy holiday season and that the new year brings good health, happiness and more square dancing

We had our usual two dances in December plus a game night social between Christmas and New Years for our members. 

We enter the new year with our club dances scheduled every second and third Saturday. They are from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM. Face masks are still required or full face shields that cover the entire face.

We will be offering square dance lessons for both new and returning dancers each Sunday from 5-7 P.M., beginning January 9. The lessons are for singles, couples, and adolescents 12 years old and up. Adolescents must be accompanied by an adult. Our caller Darrell Kalmbach is the instructor. Lessons will be at the Milwaukie community Center at 10666 SE 42nd Ave in Milwaukie, 42nd and Jackson) . This is also the location of our club dances. 

Here is to a great New year of square dancing,
Carol Mendenhall
