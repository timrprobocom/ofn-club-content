 Oh my, what a year 2021 has been.  And now we face a new variant.  Please get vaccinated and wear a mask.  We would all like to keep dancing.  
 Come join us at our January 15, 2022 dance, 7-9 pm at the Aloha Grange.  We dance at the level of the dancers attending, Mainstream and Plus.  Let's just have fun!
 Our classes start January 11, 7-9 pm at Aloha Grange.  Right now, I am staying positive that we will have them.  
 See you in a square,
  Carolene Siebert
