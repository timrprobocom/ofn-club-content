Our November 26 dance was a great success considering how many people are staying home due to the surge in COVID-19 cases in Lane County.  We had two squares on the floor with Craig Abercrombie calling and cueing to some really great songs we all know and love.   We actually had more guys out to dance than gals which is always a pleasant surprise for us gals.  We also had a lot of round dancers on the floor which was equally nice to see.  We all wish COVID would die down (it does not appear that it will ever go away) so we could dance without masks and see more people come out to join us.  Meanwhile those of us who love to dance head north to dance to Randy Dibble in Salem (thnk you Salem Swingin’ Stars!) or south to Roseburg (Timber  8’s and Buckeroos, thank you!).

We continue to dance once a month since we started back up last May.  We normally have from 2 to 4 squares in attendance and on the floor.  We have enjoyed dancing to Scott Zinser, George Hermann, Jim Hattrick, Terry Halley, Craig Abercrombie, and Darrell Kalmbach this year and hope to see more of them in 2022.

At this point we are not sure if we will have a dance in January so our next scheduled dance will be Feb.  25, 2022 with Jim Hattrick calling and possibly cueing our 58th Birthday Dance.  If we have a dance in January it would be on the third Friday if the hall is available or perhaps the 3rd Saturday if our sister club Whirl-A-Ways decided to continue holding off on having dances.  If we don’t see you at one of our dances, we hope to see you at either the New Year’s Eve dance at our Springfield hall which starts with pre-rounds at 7:30 and then mainstream with plus tips from 8-10PM.  Masks or shields are required as well as vaccinations.  Hand sanitizer will be provided.  And of course the 4th weekend in January will see our annual Mid-winter Festival happening at the Albany Linn County Fairgrounds.

See you soon.
