 Greetings from the Toe Draggers!  We have had a lively 3 dances this year, averaging 2 squares a dance.  Thank you, Sunset Promenaders, & Valley Squares for your attendance at our 1st Christmas dance.
 Toes had a very merry time decorating the hall for Christmas, and 14 of us went for pizza afterward.  Time spent with friends is even more precious now.
 Several of us are looking forward to the Tualatin Valley Council New Years Eve dance at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro.
 Please join us on January 21st for our “Alice in Wonderland” theme dance.  Our own Kathy Roberts has gone “Mad Hatter” with the fabulous decorations!  It is rumored costumes will be encouraged, so watch the OFN for the club flyer on that.
 We dance at the Kinton Grange with KC Curtis (Linda) calling, and Connie Clark cueing our first dance of the month.
  Kathy Degman
