 The Oak Hills Squares club is dancing to Mark Wheeler’s calls every Monday in the Oak Hills Community Center.  We have enough members and guests to keep only one square working from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm at a review level of main stream.  We will change format January 17th to include a main stream class time from 6:30 pm to 7:20 pm.  We hope to have new people to join us to learn and become friends.  After class we will continue the dance.
 We have been contacted by Tri Squares to visit our club on January 10th.  This would be an excellent time to visit us if you would like to see our facility in what could be our largest dance in possibly two years.
 We are a “vaccination required” club to protect those we dance with.   For information contact Linda Kitchin, (503)757-5716.  See our website, http://oakhillsquares.com/.
