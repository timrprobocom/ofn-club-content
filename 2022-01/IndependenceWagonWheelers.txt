The club has been dancing since June. We started lessons in September and have about 10 students that were invited to the Christmas dance on December 11. That dance is our annual silent auction and Christmas Dance. We raised $284 and a little over 30 cans of decaf coffee for Windsor House. The houses are homes for brain damaged persons who are learning to get back into society. Without our donations, they only get one cup of coffee a day. Now they can have more.

The club will continue with lessons and workshops into January and the students will be ready to join in the fun at Mid-Winter in Albany.
