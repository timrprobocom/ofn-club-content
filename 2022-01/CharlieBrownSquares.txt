December was a month filled with wonderful dances and lots of smiles. We had a fantastic birthday dance, with Pat Carnathan calling and Rikki cueing. We had a consistent 5 squares for Mainstream and 4 for Plus; with 2 squares of Advanced dancers. The round dance floor was full, and it was a great dance.  Our Ugly Christmas Sweater dance was also lots of fun with Roger Putzler and Rikki filling the hall with great Christmas Music.  A great group of square and round dancers enjoyed themselves. Roger and Linda Putzler are always such a delight to see down here in the Rogue Valley.  Our hall hosted the Caller/Cuer dance on the 12th, and it was a great time. 5 callers and 4 cuers shared their talents and encouraged the newer dancers with lots of smiles and fun; especially during the Purple Heart tips...LOL

Our Tuesday SSD class should be graduating in early January; the class is small, but everyone has a good time. New SSD classes should be starting on January 18th, and we hope to get more dancers to participate.  We also hope to have SSD dances on the 2nd Friday each month; with dates TBD when there is a Festival or another event happening that same nite.

Thursdays continue with a Mainstream Workshop and Plus class/workshop.
Our next dance will be January 15th. This is our Jack Frost Dance AND Amateur nite. If you've ever wanted to give calling/cueing a try come on down and you can try it with a great group of fun dancers who will encourage you!!  It's always a fun time!  Chuck and Rikki will be calling/cueing/mc'ing.

We wish everyone a wonderful holiday season and may 2022 be the best year possible.  We would love to see you in a square and look forward to seeing you soon!
