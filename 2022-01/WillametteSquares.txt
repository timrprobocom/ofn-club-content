Willamette Squares regular square dance occurs every fourth Saturday. Unfortunately this year it falls on Christmas Day so we will be going dark that day. Merry Christmas to all on December 25!

In January 2022 we will resume our dances on the fourth Saturday as usual. The Salem Square Dance Center where we regularly meet requires that everyone wear a mask or face covering. 

Our longtime caller, Sandy Harris, has announced she will be retiring. We all appreciate her support, expertise, and enthusiasm over the years.

A Happy, Healthy New Year to everyone!Â  We look forward to dancing with you all next year on the fourth Saturday of each month!  Jodee Howard
