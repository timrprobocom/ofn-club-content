We will be holding a dance on New Yearâ€™s Eve with the Back Porch Duo featuring Adam Christman and Jim Hattrick.  The dance begins at 9pm and continues until 2022.  
 Vaccinations are not required but mask wearing will be.  Face shields only without a mask on underneath are illegal at events in Washington state.
 Jan and I want to wish everyone the Happiest of New Years and look forward to seeing you in a square soon.
  Nick Johnson
