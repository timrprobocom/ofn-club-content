There were two visitations encouraged by Portland Area Council’s President, Robert Lumsden, in the month of December - both were both full of energy and enjoyed very much.   On December 4, 2021 PAC clubs visited Country Cut-Ups - as one walked inside, the floor was pink and black (PAC attire) and red Christmas colors dancing to Darrell Kalmbach and Tami Helms.  What a site with four squares on the floor at times.  
A visitation to Bachelor and Bachelorettes was December 8th - Dan Nordbye kept the squares moving (laughing) and enjoying ourselves.  Julie Stiers cued to a busy floor of rounders.   Both visitations helped the clubs financially - which was the goal.  Look to dancepac.org calendar for future visitations planned.

Chaps and Petticoats met on December 6th and chose to cancel lesson plans and 3rd-Sunday dances, for now.  Please continue to join us at our first and third Friday 'regular' dances.

Happy New Year everyone … Chaps will see you at Mid-Winter.

Happy Feet
