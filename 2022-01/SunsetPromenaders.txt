 Sunset Promenaders are continuing to dance mainstream on the first & third Saturdays with Promenaders Plus on the first, third, & fifth Thursdays of the month.
 We require dancers to wear masks or face shields and must be vaccinated to attend.  We are going to revisit the vaccination requirement at our next club meeting.  We are averaging two to three squares per dance and hope this will pick up after the first of the year.
 Our Saturday dances are performed by Mike and Julie Stout and our Thursday dances are Darrell & Erin Kalmbach and Tami Helms &Tim Keck.  Tami and Tim are also hosting Intermediate round dance lessons on Sundays at Odd fellow Hall at 3:30pm. 
 We are going to start square dance Lessons on the 16th of January.  These will be mainstream and Mike and Julie Stout will teach them from 4pm till 6pm at our hall.  We will be requiring masks or face shields and not sure at this point if we will require vaccinations. TBA.  Also we are going to have phase two round dance lessons after the first of the year.  Tami Helms and Tim Keck will be teaching. 
 If you are interested in either of these lessons let us know so we can get Idea of numbers.  If you have someone who wants to take the square dance or round dance lesson and your club is not yet started we are more than happy to get them started.  We need to get people on the floor.  They do not have to be Sunset Promenaders to take our lessons.  So if we can work together maybe we can get more interest. Contact for lessons.
