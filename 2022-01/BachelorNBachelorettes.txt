Our biggest news is that starting January, we will reduce our dance nights to the 1st, 3rd and 5th Wednesdays.  This will be the first change to our dance schedule in the 57 years of our club.  (We no longer have the attendance or volunteers to dance every week.)  For the immediate time being we’ll have a lot of fun, including our Pre-New Year’s Eve dance on December 29th.

Our Pre-New Year’s Eve dance will be primarily for new dancers, and features B-48 moves, and a plus tip at the end so there’s fun for everyone.

To be honest, there are probably too many clubs for the number of dancers we have, and the sooner a club starts to dance again, the more likely they will still be in business five years from now.  We want to be one of the clubs still dancing in five years, which is why we started dancing last June; after all, one can’t grow a dance club by not dancing.
