 In November we celebrated Veterans Day and honored our special group of guys that served our country bravely.  Thank you all for your service.  On that same day Craig Abercrombie joined Jim Hattrick on stage for great calling and cueing.
 We have five dance days in January at Aloha Grange.  Come enjoy our great callers any Monday for a fun afternoon of dancing and fellowship.  On that note, Daryl Clendenin has resigned as one of our callers.  We have appreciated very much his time with our club, and he will be missed.  Daryl is looking to stay closer to his home.  He is the caller for Oaky Doaks at the Oak Grove Community Center.  Thank you Daryl for your years with Eager Beavers.  We send our love and best wishes to you and Yvonne.
 The new year will bring lessons.  Monday February 14th we start our afternoon Plus square dance lessons, noon to 1:15 pm. Come to learn and/or refresh. Our regular Plus dance will be from 1:15 - 3:00 pm immediately after lessons.
 We continue to require face masks or shields, along with proof of vaccination, to ensure the safety of our members and guests. 
Happy New Year Friends!  Be well be safe.  Please check for up to date information at www.EagerBeavers.info.
