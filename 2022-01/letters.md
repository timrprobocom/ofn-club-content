title: Alliance of Round, Traditional, and Square Dance (ARTS-DANCE)
---
The Alliance of Round, Traditional, and Square Dance (ARTS-Dance) brings together the major dance organizations in the USA. Our goal is to revitalize our activity and educate the public on the m ultiple benefits of dancing. Quite sim ply, we have this wonderful, healthful, and fun activity, but with so much competition with other leisure pursuits, we need to figure out the best way to bring more people into it.

There are currently nine Members of the ARTS Board. These organizations include:
1. All Join Hands Foundation, Ltd  (Gordon Macaw)
2. International Association of Gay Square Dance Clubs – (IAGSDC) (Gordon Macaw)
3 National Square Dance Cam pers Association - (NSDCA) (Barbara Connelly)
4 National Executive Committee of the National Square Dance Convention - (NEC) (vacant)
5. The International Association of Round Dance Teachers – (ROUNDALAB) (Paul Connelly)
6. The International Association of Square Dance Callers – (CALLERLAB) (Betsy Gotta)
7. The International Organization of Contra Dance Leaders - (CONTRALAB) (Dotty Welch)
8. United Square Dancers of America – (USDA) (Ed & Lynda Willis)
9. USAWest Square Dance Convention Policy Board (Jim Maczko)

All Member organizations maintain their independence and concentrate on their individual goals and missions. Each member has an equal voice in the decisions of The ARTS and is encouraged to provide the views and input from  their organization. The true beauty of the alliance is its ability to increase the cooperation among the Member organizations. The ARTS has been able to bring together the varied dance forms to work toward the common goal of increasing the public’s awareness of the activity and to increase the number of dancers.

Since our first organization meeting in 2002, The ARTS has built a close relationship with all Member Organizations.  We  have actively supported National Square Dance  Conventions  (NSDCs) and  USAWest Conventions.  We  have participated in most of the activities offered during these conventions including:
1. Trail End Dance
2. Showcase Of Ideas
3. Education Program
4. Round Table Discussion
5. Ads in Daily Program Books

Our participation in the 71st NSDC&reg; includes:
1. Trail End Dance (Plus with Rounds) on Wednesday, June 22, 2022
