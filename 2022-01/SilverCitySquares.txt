Changes, changes, changes. 

Announcing our new club caller and cuer: Ian Craig and Julie Stiers. We are happy to include them in our club.

Starting in January 2022, we will be adding a second dance a month. This will be on either the fourth or fifth Saturday. We will have our second Friday dance, skip a weekend, and then have our Saturday dance. Please pay attention to flyers for details and to make sure we are dancing. Our Saturday dance in January will be cancelledÂ due to Mid-Winter Festival. Also starting in January 2022, our dances will go until 11:00 pm.

We are hoping that we will know for sure this month if the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival is happening this year. If it doesn't, we will be trying to arrange something with the Washington clubs. We will be selling raffle tickets at Mid-Winter to fundraise for our youth teams (2-3 squares possible this year). We might also have Teen Festival pins for sale - please stop by the youth table in the Mainstream Hall to see us.

We have had 13 youth students in our Mainstream class (3-4 squares at lessons). Our plan is to graduate them just before Mid-Winter. Julia Buchheit has been teaching a 2-step class and has 10 students. Our Plus class has 6 students. We really thank all our angels for helping at all of the classes. Petrina Buchheit
