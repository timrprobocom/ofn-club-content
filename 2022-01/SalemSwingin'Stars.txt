Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year!Â  May we all have a better 2022 than the last two years.

December found us dancing on three Fridays. Our 5th Friday dance is our New Year's Eve dance. We look forward to seeing more dancers as time goes on. Please support the clubs you can and let's remember we are all in this together.

Get your ribbons for Mid-Winter and we will see you in a square. Sheila Machado
