When this was written, it was warm outside and I was thinking about putting up Christmas lights. But when it is published, it will be shortly before Christmas and before the New Year arrives. 

The club took three weeks off in November to allow our cuer and three others time to recover from an outbreak of covid in our area. All had been fully vaccinated and are feeling much better by now. We resumed dancing on December 2 with review to see how much we had forgotten in the three weeks we had not been on the dance floor.
	
We have a pre-holiday dance on December 23, to celebrate Christmas and New Yearâ€™s early since we are not hosting a dance on December 31.
	
We are hoping that your holidays were bountiful with lots of food, friends and most importantly, family. Did you get everything on your Christmas list? Marilyn Schmit
