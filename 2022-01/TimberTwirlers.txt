Albany Timber Twirlers will begin dancing again in January on the first and fourth Fridays. Hopefully you can come and join us. Bruce Lowther is the caller and Sandy Harris is the cuer. We miss everybody. We will be following the state protocols for mask requirements but bring your own bottle of water or something to drink. No food to share unless it us commercially prepared. Other than that, we will dance and have a good time. Sandy Harris
