 After months of not dancing, our board came up with a new idea tonight, to try to get the show back on the road, so-to-speak.  Beginning in January we will temporarily be a "visitation club" and go to other clubs to dance.  It will be made clear to our members regarding the rules of each club we visit -- whether they require masks or vaccinations.  Because right now, after taking a poll of our members, opinions were all over the place regarding dancing at our own club just yet.  Our new visitations chairman, Ursula, will arrange two dance visitations per month for those people who wish to start dancing again.  Details of this new plan will be publicized to our members through email and our monthly newsletter, "The Tattler".
