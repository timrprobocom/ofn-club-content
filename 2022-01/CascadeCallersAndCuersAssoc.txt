Merry Christmas and may 2022 bring good news and many blessiongs!

We did not have our October 30 dance because of COVID.  We'll wait until it is safer.  It does feel like the light may be finally showing at the end of the tunnel.  We want to thank everyone for their patience and understanding during the pandemic. It's hard, but we will make it and get back to dancing, calling and cueing.
 
Our next scheduled dance is now April 30, 2022.  Surely, things will have slowed down by then.  We're wanting everyone to be safe and feel safe.
