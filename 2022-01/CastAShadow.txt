Our club continues to hold off on gathering to dance.  We haven’t danced since July.  If the number of cases in our area drops down sufficiently, we hope to start up again in the new year.  Please get on Fred Beisse’s email list if you want to be notified of a dance opportunity.

We normally dance on Sunday afternoons once or twice a month to recorded music which can be halted so we can review moves that break down squares.  We often will have two squares in attendance and are easy going and encourage participation from one and all at the advanced level.
