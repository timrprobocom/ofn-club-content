You may be reading this in late December so I will remind you of our New Year’s Eve dance on December 31st, held at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro.  The caller and cuer for the evening will be Daryl and Yvonne Clendenin.  There is a new format this year.  The dance begins at 9:00 PM and goes until 12:15 AM. There will be an open break where desserts and coffee will be available.  At midnight there will be a pause in the dancing to usher in the New Year.
