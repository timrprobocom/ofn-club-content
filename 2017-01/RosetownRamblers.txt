The Ramblers closed out the 2016 dance year with our usual verve, raising the roof on the Milwaukie Grange with Anne Uebelacker calling on December 3. We welcomed visitors from Chaps and Petticoats, Spin Cycle Squares, Tualatin Timber Squares, and BnBs. Thanks for everyone’s support of our club in 2016.

 We finished our Fall series of lessons on December 14, with 8 students completing the Mainstream program.

We will not be offering a new series of lessons in January 2017. Instead, starting January 4, 2017, we will be offering Mastering Mainstream and Practicing Plus (M2P2). The goals of M2P2 are to help our recent graduates become impeccable Mainstream dancers—with lots of Dance by Definition work—and to reward our dedicated angels by offering at least a few Plus tips each night. Our caller will be Ian Craig, who will workshop calls that seem to be causing dancers trouble. All dancers who are familiar with the Mainstream calls, and would like to be challenged to become better dancers, are welcome. Solo dancers and those wishing to try all-position dancing are especially welcome; we will find you a dance partner. The cost will be $3 per person, and we will be dancing at the Ankeny Street Studio on Wednesdays from 7-9 pm. The studio is located at 975 SE Sandy Blvd., Portland (entrance on SE Ankeny Street).

Our monthly dance for January will be on January 14 at the Milwaukie Grange. Steven Cole will be calling. We will be alternating Mainstream and Plus tips from 7:30 to 9:30 pm. This will be our annual Black and White Ball, so dancers are encouraged to wear some combination of black and white; it doesn’t have to be formal. You could wear white jeans, a black shirt, and black shoes. Or a black and white striped shirt. Or black jeans and white tennis shoes. It’s fun to see the different combinations that dancers come up with. Human ingenuity is a remarkable thing!
