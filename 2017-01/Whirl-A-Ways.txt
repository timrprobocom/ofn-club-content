As we look forward to the New Year we have some great memories of 2016.  The Whirl-A-Ways had a busy holiday season visiting the Sweet Home Squarenaders in November for their annual turkey dance. It was great to have Jim Hattrick on the stage.  

The local clubs are hosting a combined beginners class again this year and we are trying something new with the B51 program. So, with the completing of the first 10 weeks we hosted a new dancer dance right after Thanksgiving. These dances provide our new dancers an opportunity to experience a new caller and meet more of those who have been dancing for awhile.

We only had one dance in December to allow the club members an opportunity to enjoy Christmas Eve with their families. On the other side everyone was encouraged to visit with the other clubs dancing at the Emerald Dance Center.

We also only have one dance in January on the 14th and our mid-year business meeting. It is that time of year when we begin the search for new club officers. Of course we will be dark on the 28th for Mid-Winter Festival. We hope to see you all there.
