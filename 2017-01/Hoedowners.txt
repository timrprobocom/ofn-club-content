November is such a food centric month for the Hoedowners.  We began the month with our Turkey Toss dance on the 12th.  Let’s see, bean filled bags sliding into the corn holes to win a turkey.  Sounds like the beginning of a great meal.  Eleven turkeys were won by the talented participants while the others left just a wee bit disappointed.  The dancing is never a disappointment.
 Hey foodies, a spectacular Italian Bistro was open on the evening of Wednesday, November 16th as we held our Annual Spaghetti Dinner.  Nothing wafts like the smell of garlic, on bread or in sauce; fresh pasta, fresh salad and a decadent desert.  What a great evening with 60 dining and visiting across the dinner table; new dancers and club members alike.  
 What do we do but have a Soup Dance on Saturday, November 26th.  With a good variety of yummy soups to pick from, it hit the spot on a chilly fall night.
 Our new dancers are busy square dancing.  That’s right; we’re past the novice stage and looking forward to seeing them across the square on Saturday nights.  These folks are fast learners!
 In January we’ll be holding our annual Black and White Sparkle Ball.  It’s the traditional kick-off to the New Year.  The ballroom is always glistening and glittering, the lights are dimmed a bit and as we enjoy the mirror ball’s reflections.  It makes for a spectacular evening!  Don’t miss it.
 We’ll be dark for the 27-29th of January for Mid-Winter.  Our plans are underway for another three day Albany weekend of dancing and social events.  We hope to see you there.
