Happy New Year! 2016 was a great year and we hope 2017 is even better. 

We have had lots of fun theme dances. In November we had a pumpkin dance with lots of great pumpkin treats. December was our New Dancers Dance (more on that next month) and our Christmas dance. Love the holiday time of year. Come join us at our dances the first and third Fridays of the month for great fun. Sandy
