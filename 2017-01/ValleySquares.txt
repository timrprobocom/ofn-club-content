Happy New Year!  Welcome in 2017 by attending our New Beginnings & Resolutions Dance January 7th,   Renee Ruud calling & Connie Clark cueing.  On the 21st, Janienne Alexander will join Connie at our Celebrate Diversity Dance.  
 Our Basics/ Mainstream lessons start January 17th.  We hope to see lots of students & that new dancers who need some review or extra practice join us as well.  They are to be held Tuesdays at Aloha Grange from 7-9.  
 We had a wonderful time on our visitation to Columbia River's Beatles Dance.  Mark Wheeler entertained the crowd with music that still has resonance 50 years later.
 Renee Ruud shared her lovely voice at our Turkey Dance in November.
