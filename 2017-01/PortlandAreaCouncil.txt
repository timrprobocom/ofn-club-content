The PAC trailers are now stored at an undisclosed location and ready to rent or loan out this spring and summer. The PAC will not attempt to run them in the Starlite Parade, opting instead for more neighborhood events

While we’re on the subject of neighborhood events, the PAC is closely watching the results of clubs that are having open neighborhood dances, such as Valley Squares and Country Cut-Ups. Our thinking is that it will give us better advertising at mostly no cost.

We are noting that one of the detriments to future new callers and cuers is no place to call or cue.  This is intensified by clubs who hire “regular” callers and cuers, shutting out any new caller or cuer up for hire.
