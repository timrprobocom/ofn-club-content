<h3> Alvis &amp; Norma Glock<br>
Sets in Order<br>
South Coast Council</h3>
<p>
Alvis and Norma Glock are the driving force that keeps the Sets In Order
club alive and active.  Sets in Order is the oldest square dance club in
the world -- 70 years old this ytear -- and that would not have happened
without the Glock's continual dedication to the club.
<p>
Alvis and Normal have been involved with square and round dancing for
over 37 years.  They have served as South Coast Council President and
Vice President.  For the Sets in Order, they have served as President,
Vice President, Treasurer and Club Delegate, and worked on the 1993
Summer Festival.
<p>
They are at evey lesson, both squares and rounds.  They arrive early
to unlock the building and set up the chairs.  They re the last ones to
leave after putting the chairs away and sweeping the floor.  They greet
everyone at the door on dance nights, get all the food ready for the
after-dance potluck, clean up the kitchen and dance hall afterward,
making sure everything is cleaner than when they arrived, and again sre
the last ones to leave when everything is done.
<p>
The Glocks make the arrangements every year for the Sets In Order to
dance on the fairgrounds at the Coos County Fair.  They spearhead the
effort to dance on the parade float in the Coquille Gay 90's Parade
and the Coos County Fair parade.  They were also part of the Bandon
Cranberry Festival parade floats for several years.  hey have for many
years decorated the community involvement booth at the Coost County Fair,
promoting our club and lessons.
<p>
When their son-in-law built a new parade float for the club to use,
they were right there to help where they could.  There were many hours
of priming and painting the hand rails and decking in their daughter
and son-in-law's yard.
<p>
For many years, they also lenmt their help to keep the Beachcombers club
in Port Orford from fading away.  Through the years, they spent countless
hours mowing the grass, repairing the building, and helping host both
the July 4th Birthday weekend and the Battle Rock Labor Day weekend.
<p>
During all of the years of classes they have helped with, they have taught
all three of their daughters to dance, their son-in-law, 3 grandchildren,
the grandchildrens' spouses, several of the grandchildren's cousins,
and are now preparing for the great-grandchildren.
<p>
They are not ones to draw attention to themselves.  They are steady as a
rock, always there, always to be counted on -- people that a club needs
to keep going year after year.

<h3>Ray &amp; Zola Jones<br>
Whirl-A-Ways<br>
Emerald Empire</h3>
<p>
Ray and Zola were both born in Eugene, Oregon and raised in the same rural community west of Eugene, and so are native
"webfoots".

<p>
They first learned to square dance while stationed in the US Air Force at Laredo, Texas, on the Rio Grande River and
border of Mexico in 1972.  The name of the club located on the base was the "Rio Ramblers", and they got to square dance
in a bull ring in the Mexican town just across the river, this earning a "Bull Ring" badge and an "International" badge
for dancing in two separate countries in one evening!

<p>
In 1980, after retiring from 20 plus years in the Air Force and moving home to Eugene, they joined the "River Road Mixers"
square and round dance club.  In 1981 they were asked to be on the Mid-Winter Festival Committee, and have served on the
committee continuously for 34 years, including as Festival Chairman in 1988.  The Mixers club disbanded in 1986, so in 
1987 they joined the Whirl-A-Ways and remain active to this day.

<p>
Raymond was president of the Emerald Empire Council in 1985, 1986, and 1992.  He was chairman of the area's annual 
benefit dance in 1986.  In 1992-93, Zola was the State Reporter for the Oregon State Federation.  In 1991 to 1994, they
served on the Oregon Trail Board as Program Chairman for Oregon's 1994 National Square Dance Convention held in Portland.
Ray retired from his current occupation in 1997 and he and Zola began traveling in their motorhome, including every winter,
February to May, to Southern Arizona, dancing in Yuma with the many Oregon dancers who winter there, and also dancing in
Mesa and Tucson.  In 2001, they had the honor of being appointed Oregon Goodwill Ambassadors and served in this position
for 5 years, taking Oregon square, round, and clog dancing information wherever they traveled.  They also served again
on the program committee for the Oregon National Square Dance Convention in 2005.  From 2009 to 2012 Zola served as
State Historian for the Oregon State Federation, and Raymond served as State Federation President in 2011-2012 from being
elected First Vice President in 2010.  Also in 2012 Zola was elected by the Emerald Empire Area Council as Area Delegate
to the State Federation, a position they currently serve in.

<p>
They have held offices in their club, and Zola has been the club OFN Reporter and club delegate to the council for several
years, and they also help with the council's activities.  They continue to attend and help with the Whirl-A-Ways club
activities, and always support their club and council.

<p>
They have thoroughly enjoyed over the years dancing in the different areas of Oregon by way of festival visitations,
State Federation meetings, and special dance weekends, and seeing towns they might not have been to before, and always 
the best part meeting other dancers and sharing this great activity we're all involved in.

<h3>
Steve & Valerie Murphy<br>
Charlie Browns<br>
Rogue-Sis-Q Council</h3>

<p>
Steve & Valerie began their dancing career in 1970 when they joined
the Spindrifters Square Dance Club and the Salinas Lariat Swingers Folk
Dance Club, both in Salinas, CA.  The Lariat Swingers was an exhibition
club that did International Folk Dancing all over CA.  The Murphys
were the babies of the club since they were the only dancers under 50.
From there they took a break until 2005 when they returned to square and
round dancing in Oregon.  While members of the Klamath Country Squares
they held offices of President (Steve) and Secretary (Valerie).  Also,
Valerie was President of the Interstate Highlanders Council and Steve was
delegate to the Federation for four years.  In 2009 they were appointed
Goodwill Ambassadors by the outgoing Federation President.  Although they
served out their 5 year term in 2014 they still promote square and round
dancing by attending an average of 1-2 festivals per month.

The Murphys are members of the Rogue Squares in Medford and The Charlie
Browns in Grants Pass.  They have taught ballroom dancing through
the Klamath Community College system and Steve cues and choreographs
round dances.  They spend their winters in Mesa, AZ which is the Round
Dance capital of the world.

<h3>Ferrous & Karen Steinka<br>
Eager Beavers &amp; Hoedowners<br>
Tualatin Valley Council</h3>

<p>
Ferrous and Karen are a couple that loves to square dance.  They took lessons in 1980
with the Tualatin Twirlers and held offices as New Members Board Representative and
President.  they organized club outings, picnics, and mystery trips.  The following
year, they went to plus classes and joined the Columbians, and next year came round
dance lessons.
<p>
Ferrous and Karen belong to more than one club in the Tualatin Valley Council, and
their allegiance to each club is strong and true.  They have served on the board of
both clubs as Agent of Record for 7 years.  They have served as Council Delegates for
both clubs and currently serve as Vice President for the Eager Beavers.  They are active in
the TVC in several areas.  As OFN Editor for the TVC for 6 years, he co-authored the
rewrite of the TVC Constitution, By-Laws , Practices &amp; Procedures, and the Delegates
introduction document.  They also compiled and formatted for printing the TVC directory for
2016-17.  They assisted several clubs from the PAC, TVC, Blue Mountains Council, and
Mid-Willamette Council with their web presence.  They wrote, hosted, and maintained nine
web pages for various clubs.
<p>
In addition, they maintained a variety of useful square dance related tools, lists, and 
links about the local area and beyond, affording the reader to "Find a Hall" or "Find a
Club" with ease.  These took several months of time to compile and verify.  Tim Roberts
states on the Oregon Federation web page, "Ferrous Steinka of the Hoedowners has created a 
web site that contains maps to virtually every location in Oregon and Southwest Washington 
that has been used for a square dance in the recent past.  This is quite a valuable resource."
<p>
Ferrous and Karen love to square dance and can be seen often at many dance venues in the
area.  They are outgoing and friendly, always quick to give you a hug and shake your hand.
They excel in mentoring new dance couples, making sure they are kept informed and made to
feel welcome.
<p>
Ferrous and Karen understand the importance of advertising lessons, keeping the public
informed by using various print media and promiting dances through the use of photos and
articles.  They have even sold ribbons to festivals put on by other clubs, just trying to
go the extra mile to promote dancing.
<p>
They received the TVC Recognition Award in 2011 for outstanding contributions, and the
Eager Beavers Swenson Award in 2015 for continued outstanding support of the club, and for
consistently promoting square and round dancing in the community.

<img class='float' src="t300/Barbara-Tipton.png">
Barbara Tipton<br>
Independence Wagon Wheelers &amp; Valley River Dancers<br>
Mid-Willamette Area Council</h3>
<p>
Barbara started square dancing in 1963, and throughout her 50-plus years in this activity,
she has been and continues to be involved in many aspects of this great activity.  She is
extremely active in all areas of the club and council.  She has held offices in the Oregon
Federation of Square &amp; Round Dance Clubs as Mid-Willamette Delegate and 2nd Vice
President.  In the Mid-Willamette Area, she has been President, Vice President, Treasurer
and Secretary.  At the club leve, she has served as President, Vice President, Treasurer,
and Delegate many times.  When there is a requirement for someone to fill a position,
Barbara continually steps up and quietly takes the reponsibility required.
<p>
Barbara was Chairman of the very successful 2008 Oregon Summer Festival held at the Polk
County Fairegrounds in Rickreall.  An example of Barbara's involvement is her participation
in the operation of the resale Clothing area annually at the Oregon Mid-Winter Festival.
She is also the first one to open her home when there is a need for a location for a club
meeting.  In addition to her other involvement, barbara spends a great deal of her time as
a member and board ofgficer of the Salem Square Dance Association, Inc.  Although Barbara
is on the governing board of the Salem Square Dance Center, she continually operates
behind the scenes accomplishing such things as scrubbing the floors and toilets prior to
one of the renters holding a dance in this facility,
<p>
Barbara always has the betterment of square and round dancing and clogging in the forefront
of her thoughts.  An example of this thinking was when she presented the idea of renting a
booth at the Polk County Fair to try and interest folks in our activity.  During the 4 days
of the fair, the staff collected five pages of names and contact information to be invited
to lessons at the Independence Wagon Wheelers.
<p>
Barbara was instrumental in the successful completion of the Single Square Dancers
Convention held in Portland, Oregon in August, 2014.  She handled the registration by
herself, and assisted with many other details.
<p>
Barbara is an all-around hard working person attemtping to better this activity at all
times.  There is no job too large, too small, or too dirty for Barbara to jump in and see
it through.  Everyone who knows Barbara knows you can count on her for anything and
everything.  When she assumes a responsibility, you can rest assured that the job will be
accomplished, and with the desired results.  She is always a phone call away from answering
your needs.
