Willamette Squares held its annual Thanksgiving dinner dance and there was more than enough food for the traditional Thanksgiving dinner. And the pie was exceptional! The meal was served, everyone danced, then took a break for pie, and then danced some more. Special thanks to Nancy and Brice Baker who organized the dinner and did so much of the leg work. Of course, everyone pitched in which made everything go smoother. Thanks to everyone for the part you played in putting this on. 

Our club missed our president, John Templin, who was in the hospital when he would rather have been on the dance floor. We wish him an eventual full recovery. Thanks to Gary Ohren who filled in for him at the dance. Not only was John's presence missed when it came to dancing but also when it came time to divide up the leftovers! 

Just a reminder that Willamette Squares is going dark on the fourth Saturday of December which is the 24th, but not all is lost because on January 8, 2017 at 1:30 will be our New Dancer dance. Then the fourth Saturday of January 2017, January 28, Willamette Squares will be dark because of Mid-Winter. We hope to see you all at our new dancer dance in the new year. May 2017 bring peace, hope, and a whole lot of dancing!  Jodee Howard
