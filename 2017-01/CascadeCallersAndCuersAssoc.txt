Please join us to bring in the new year!  December 31st this year!  8:30 p.m. - Pre-Rounds with Christina Corelli and 9:00 p.m. - Squares with Roger Putzler. We will celebrate hourly for New York City, Chicago (where Roger was born and grew up), Ontario, Oregon, and finally Eugene/Springfield.  Wow, what a night it's going to be.  We have also decided to charge $2.50 per person as this was the price for dances back in the 80's. Please bring a pie.  We have not decided on a dress code so anything goes!
     
It's also the hall's 25th anniversary.  Back in 1991 we acquired the hall in Springfield from Kenny McKay who took off 25 grand from the asking price because of what we were going to do at the hall. He allowed us to use the hall for one year before we bought it. Those were generous offers on his part which we appreciated. He knew a good thing when he saw it.
    
The next scheduled CCCA dance isn't until April 29th. We have meetings and dances on the fifth Saturdays. 
 
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from CCCA
Christina Corelli, secretary
