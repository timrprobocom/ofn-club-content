A big thank you to Cam and committee members for putting on a fun Christmas party.
 During the month of January we will be continuing lessons.  The lessons will be at basic to mainstream level.  The lessons take place on Sundays and will be taught by Terry Halley.  More info is on our webpage.  The Tri Squares website is a tool that should be utilized.  The website gives you more in-depth details such as our dance themes and any questions you may have.  Please note we will be dark during the month of January.
 See you all at Midwinter,
 Take Care,
  Leslie Woodland
