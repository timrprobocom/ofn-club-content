We are back dancing after having two different Thursdays off in November due to instructor illness and Thanksgiving. We also take two Thursdays off in December (Dec. 22 & 29) but will then dance on New Year’s Eve.

We are working on perfecting our steps for the Showcase of Rounds for Mid-Winter, and making preparations for New Year’s Eve. I think we are the only round dance in the area, so we are looking forward to a good crowd to enjoy a relaxing night of dancing and camaraderie. We will have three cuers in attendance for the evening.  In addition to our Cheryl, Ken Pratt and David Vomocil will give us part of their evening also. 

January will see us finishing up some Foxtrot workshops and any leftover Tango steps needed. Future rhythms haven’t been decided yet. Come and join us for some laid back dancing and just plain fun. Marilyn Schmit
