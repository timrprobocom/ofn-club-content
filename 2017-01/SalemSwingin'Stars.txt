Happy New Year to All. By the time you read this, Christmas will be just a short memory away.  We hope that everyone had a Blessed Christmas and Holiday Season!!
Our new dancers are well on their way to becoming polished square dancers. Our new dancer dance on December 2 was very well attended. Thanks to all the Angels from all the different clubs. Your help and gentle assistance are what makes our new dancers want to continue. Everyone had a great time!

December brings a 5th Friday Plus Dance on December 30.  Advanced Rounds will begin at 7:00 pm; Advanced Level at 7:30 pm followed by Plus with Intermediate Rounds at 8:00 - 10:15 pm. Come join the fun. See you all on the Dance Floor. Sheila Machado
