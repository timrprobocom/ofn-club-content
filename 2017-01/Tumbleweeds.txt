The Tumbleweeds had a fantastic Thanksgiving dinner at our 3rd Friday dance.  Betty Hart cooked the Turkey while the members brought the food  that goes with the turkey.  We had so much food and it was so tasty!  We will have a Christmas dinner and a New Year dance coming up.

We had a large visitation of River City Dancers November 5th. 

Our caller Les Seeley is retiring as our caller end of January.  He will be missed by many.  Remember. singles and couples are welcome to join us dancing.  Most important, everyone gets to dance.
