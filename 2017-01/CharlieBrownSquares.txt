The Charlie's enjoyed a wonderful celebration of their 49th birthday on December 3rd. The talented Richard Lane called a fantastic dance full of humor, challenges and wonderful entertainment. If you haven't heard his Redneck song, please ask him to do it next time!!  Bob Dingman cued a wonderful dance and there was a lot of dancing and laughter enjoyed. There were 9 squares at the dance, with almost 3 squares enjoying an extra challenging Plus Workshop.  Thank you to all the dancers for the gifts and for helping us celebrate!! Next year is our 50th birthday & we have a wonderful dance planned with special guests Charlie Robertson from California calling & Oregon's own Cheryl Manley cueing. Looking forward to an even bigger celebration for our 50th!!!!
