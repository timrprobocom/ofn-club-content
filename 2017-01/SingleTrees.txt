Our December holiday dinner and square dance party with Jim Hattrick calling and Jackie Gale cueing was fun. We had mostly club dancers with a few guests. The hall looked great with all the Christmas trees, table decorations, hanging garlands, and our decked out fireplace. And, the food was delicious. Thanks to all the cooks who donated such yummy food.

January 13th will bring our Snowfest dance, held at the B51 level for all the dancers to enjoy. In our joint clubs dance lessons we are getting learners to be comfortable at the B51 level and adding the rest of the mainstream moves following regular lessons as they are ready to move on. So, we have a good number of dancers at the B51 level. We know that Jim Hattrick will do us proud getting our new dancers to have a good time at that level of dancing. So bring your new dancers and join us for a fun time.
