We had a great visitation (Nov 19) to the Country Cut-Ups and retrieved our banner.

We also (most especially) thank our faithful and regular visitors from the Country Cut-Ups and the Chips and Petticoats for all their faithful support they gave last year.

After toying with the matter for several months, we are increasing our door donation (for out of area callers) to $7.  Well, letâ€™s face it, our dwindling numbers mean we have to ask more per person to meet expenses.  Yes, our faithful bookkeeper, Debbie Debit assures us this is necessary.

We are preparing for our basket raffle (Dec 14).  It not only brings a few dollars to our club, but promotes good will.  We make the baskets as alluring as we can, so even the guys will want to buy them.

And of course, we ladies also look alluring as possible, getting all the solo guys to come dane with us.  (Nov 30, we again had more guys than gals at our dance.)  Come check us out..
