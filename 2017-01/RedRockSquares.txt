In the spirit of the season, ​Redrocks Squares thought it would be fun and a good way to give back to the community if ​they collected waterproof gloves, socks and/or boots to donate to FAN - Family Access Network. They serve low income families with kids in the Redmond School District. ​The club will collect items at both of the December Redrock Squares dances.

​Debbie Klug has decorate​d​a cardboard box to collect t​he items in, ​she will then deliver the donations when ​they are done collecting.
