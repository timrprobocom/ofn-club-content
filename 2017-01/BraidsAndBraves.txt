Wow! What a fun dance Dan Nordbye called for us on November 19! We had five squares on the floor and 12 different clubs in attendance. We also raised over $200 for Homeward Bound, McMinnville's No-kill Animal Shelter. What a wonderful kick-off to the holidays. Â 
Starting with our December Christmas dance, we'll be on a new dance schedule: Plus workshop 7-7:15 pm. Pre-rounds 7:15-7:30 pm. Mainstream squares 7:30-9:30 pm. Food and fellowship 9:30-10 pm. 

We also want to share some sad news. We lost a beloved former member to cancer shortly before Thanksgiving. Gloria Borges and her husband Lee were very active in our club, the MWA, and around the state until she became sick. She is greatly missed.

 See you soon, we hope. Carmen
