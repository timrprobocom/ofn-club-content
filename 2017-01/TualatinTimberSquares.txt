We had a successful and fun time dancing one tip only to guest caller Jaden Frigo while he sat at his computer in Sydney, Australia.  He did a 6 couple square and it was fun to hear square dance calls in a foreign accent.
 We will be starting lessons the first Wednesday in January.  The first 3 nights of classes are being advertised as Party Nights to the public.  $5 per person each week, youth half price.  We will not be hosting dances in January and February as we focus in on developing our new dancers.  We would love the help of other angels to come out on Wednesdays.  Our dances will resume on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday’s in March.  The first half will be a student level dance, break, and then the remainder at Mainstream level until we are at full mainstream level with our new dancers.
 TTS won the trophy from Oakey Doaks with 62% of their members in attendance!  We will be hosting our trophy dance March 22nd in conjunction with our New Dancer Dance.  Students of other clubs will be counted towards that club’s percentage.  Please encourage your new dancers to come out and support our new dancers and see who wins the trophy!
 We will be celebrating our First Anniversary April 26th with a Black, Red, Silver theme (club colors).
 If you would like to be added to the TTS weekly newsletter to keep up on all of the adventures and where the Banner Bandits are hitting next send an email to OregonSquareDance@gmail.com.
