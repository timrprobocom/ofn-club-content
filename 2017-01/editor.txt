<p>We have several long pieces about Mid-Winter Festival this month, coming up quickly at the end of January. &nbsp;There are also advertisements from the River City Riders for benefit dances to help them show their stuff around the country. &nbsp;Be sure to take a look.</p>
<p>If you tried something different with your classes this year, why not write me a short note about it for publication next month? &nbsp;We can best serve the community by sharing the things that worked, and even the things that didn't.</p>
