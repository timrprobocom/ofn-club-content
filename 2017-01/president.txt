<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy New Year to everyone who reads this. Even though this will get printed before the end of December, it will fit just as well. I hope that you have fond memories of 2016 and have plans to equal or better 2017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new dancer classes are continuing and some coming to a close near Mid-Winter so be prepared to assist the new dancers when they come to your club to dance. They will be unsure of themselves, but make them feel welcome to your club and into a square. The more they feel comfortable, the more they will dance and become the dancers that all the instructors aimed for when classes began.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will all soon begin to look in our closets to figure out what we are wearing to Mid-Winter, when we are leaving our homes to drive to Albany, and how many friends we will see for the first time since last Mid-Winter. Have you confirmed your lodging yet? &nbsp;We did about a week ago and it is a good thing we did. Our reservation did not stick from last year when we left our hotel, so we would not have had a room if I did not check on it recently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon it will be time for clubs to vote for officers for the next dance year. Consider putting your name on the club ballot and be an involved member of your club. Your ideas do count and they should be heard. We will be putting together a slate of officer nominees during Mid-Winter. We would love to have some of you run for Federation office also. Look in your state directory to see who is on the nomination committee and contact them to let them know you are interested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the end of the month, see you in Albany for a good weekend of friends, fun and good food somewhere in town. Get your feet ready to dance the weekend away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring your money with you and register for Summer Festival while you are in Albany. They need your support as well.&nbsp;</p>
