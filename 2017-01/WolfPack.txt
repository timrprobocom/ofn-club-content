December 3rd we had our Holiday Dance.  Great fun and lots of special holiday related door prizes.  Sandy Harris called and cued as Christina was home with a sick Kirby.  We wish him well.  Larry also called a tip for us.  DonÂ’t forget Tuesday nights are lesson nights at the Emerald Square Dance Center and a B51 dance Wednesday, December 14th.  Our next club dance is January 7th.  Hoping you can join us for the fun.
