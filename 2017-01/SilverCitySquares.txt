We had a great attendance for our October Ham Dinner/Storybook Dance. Everyone enjoyed the dinner very much and then we were able to dance off all we ate. We did have prizes for those who dressed up as a favorite story/nursery rhyme character - our three winners were: Paulette Stahlnecker as Gretel; Jasmine Mauro as the cow who jumped over the moon and Thomas Buchheit as Robin Hood.

We are still selling teen festival pins but we are currently out and mom is having difficulty in connecting with the person who is supposed to be getting more pins to us. Please keep checking with us!

Our December dance was our New Dancer's Dance and Baked Potato Dinner. We also had our experienced clothing at 1/2 price. I will report more on this dance next time.
