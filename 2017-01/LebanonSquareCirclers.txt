It is certainly a busy time of year and that is true for our club. Our first dance in November was a "Sports Night" dance with various ways of expressing our favorite teams. Charlotte Jeskey called and Jackie Gale cued.   

On the second Saturday night of November, many of our club members attended the Turkey Dinner Dance in Sweet Home.  Wonderful dinner and great dancing!  Jim Hattrick called and Jackie Gale cued.  

Then on November 19, the club journeyed to the Braids and Braves dance featuring Dan Nordbye, a national caller.  We had over two squares in attendance and earned a banner.  It was a most enjoyable and fun evening.  
   
Our members enjoyed Thanksgiving with their families and on the Saturday morning following the holiday, our club put its display of lights in Ralston Park in Lebanon. This is a community activity with many lighted displays throughout the park for the holidays.   There was also a Christmas parade with the 5A Football State Champions as Grand Marshall. And the rain even stopped for a short time that evening.  
   
On November 29 - National Square Dance Day - 18 of our club members did a demonstration dance at the new Veterans Home in Lebanon. It brought back good memories for these residents. 
 
 Our first dance of December was a Toy Dance and Ugly Sweater Dance with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing. Representatives from our local Fire Department came to pick up the donated toys and experienced some dancing.  
 
On January 15, the Lebanon Square Circlers will celebrate 68 years of dancing.   Charlotte Jeskey will be calling with guest caller, Jim Voll, and Jackie Gale will be cueing. Strawberry shortcake will be served. We hope to see many of our dancer friends there. See you in a square!  Marilyn York
