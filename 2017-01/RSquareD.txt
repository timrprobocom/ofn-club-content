On November 11th, R Square D celebrated our Veterans with free admission to the dance and a tribute to all that served.  Three to four squares of dancers from Harbor Haylofters, Happy Hoppers, Ruff & Ruffles and Cougar Squares danced to patriotic hymns called throughout the evening.  We are grateful to all that have and that continue to serve this amazing country.  Thank you veterans.  
 On The 12th of November, R Square D Dancers went to Columbia River Dancers and came back with one of their travelling banners.  A great time dancing was had by all.  
 Thank you to Marvin and Barbara Wilburn for hosting our monthly meeting on the 21st at the Kelso Senior Center.
 It’s a new year, welcome 2017.  We will be bringing in the new year with a dance on the 8th celebrating with a Snowflake Frolic, let’s all hope for snow, just not too much.  On the 23rd we will come together in warmth and fellowship with a dance followed up with warm winter soups, mmm.  Please come join us as we start a new year of new friends, the best kind, square dancing friends.  
 R  Square D will start a new set of lessons on January 4, 2017, tell all your friends.  The lessons that have currently been running have been well attended with 4 squares on the floor for most of the night.  Craig Abercrombie makes learning a lot of fun.
