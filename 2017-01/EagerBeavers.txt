Ring out the old; ring in the new.  2016 seemed to over before it began.  Hope all of you had a year of good dancing and fun with family and friends.  Go ahead; make those resolutions and if you can keep 80% of them; congratulate yourself.
 I hope one of those resolutions is brushing up on or learning to dance Plus because we are offering lessons starting February 13th.  See more details under OFN lessons, our website or call Karen 503-649-9487 or Sally 503-645-2414.  Lessons are only a $4.00 donation.  All three of our callers will be teaching so you will receive excellent instruction learning not only how to respond to the calls but that callers have their own style of calling.  Classes are on Monday, 12:00 to 1:15 PM.
 We were lucky and pleased to have Dave and Patty Cooper visit our club on November 28th and cue for free.  Dave has been very active at the state level and they are now being ambassadors visiting clubs around the state.  Thank you Dave and Patty.  
 NOTICE: We are dark on the day after Christmas, December 26th, everyone enjoy the day with your family.  Also, the Church will NOT be available on January 2nd so we will dance at the Aloha Grange, 185th and TV Highway.
 We dance on most holidays.  Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 to 3:00 p.m., at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
