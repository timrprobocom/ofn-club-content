We have been busy here at the barn! Lessons are moving smoothly and our students are looking forward to joining other dancers from around Oregon at the Mid-Winter celebration in January. In order to get ready and have as much floor time as possible, they have been visiting lots of new dancer dancersâ€¦we have our new dancer dance coming up here at the barn in January.

We had a new student Christmas dance and a mainstream Christmas dance this past month. We were able to do a gift exchange for our young dancers and an ornament exchange for our adult dancers. We all had a great time and really enjoyed the company of each other after such a stressful election season.

We are all filled with gratitude, thankfulness, and appreciation for this wonderful season and hope that you are as well. May your New Year be filled with health, happiness, and lots of dancing!

See you in a square in 2017!
