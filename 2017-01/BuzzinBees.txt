Happy New Year from the Buzzing Bees. Our club is doing well with lessons and they should be ready to graduate in early February. We plan to bring the class to midwinter in January.

We had a great turnout at our giving thanks dance and November and took six big bags of donated gifts to each of two assisted living facilities that have a high percentage of low-income seniors. I want to give a big thanks to all who donated. The activity directors were overwhelmed with the amount of donation I brought them.

We are sad to say that Debbie Combs is retiring and her last dance will be on January 21st which is also our beginners Jamboree and pajama Dance. Come to celebrate her retirement and wear your PJs. We wish you a happy and healthy New Years.
