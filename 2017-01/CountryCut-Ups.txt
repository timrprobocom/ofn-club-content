January brings a big change for the Country Cut-Ups. We are trying out a new dance schedule for this year. We are moving from 1st, 3rd, and 5th Saturdays to 1st, 4th, and 5th Saturdays. There are some other clubs with the 1st and 3rd schedule that we never get to dance with, so we are hoping to visit them and to have them check us out. However, the first time we try for a 4th Saturday, it is the weekend of Mid-Winter Festival, and we are not going to try and compete! Many of our Cut-Ups attend this, so we will be dark. Plan to see you in Albany!

We have a great mainstream class going with Scott Zinser guiding them through the calls. They will finish up soon and we are planning to start another mainstream class right away. That will give these students a chance to jump back in as angels and solidify their dancing skills. Seeing the new students who know nothing yet, should build their confidence! Some of our current students are already signing up to become Cut-Ups, so we are hoping to build up our club membership roster.

We are planning a Mystery Trip with a bus ride and are opening it up to non-members once the members have all had a chance to sign up. If you are interested, talk to Robert or Young Lumsden for details. We are planning some other special events in 2017, so stay tuned!
