For some years I've been telling people that one of the many things that I like about square dancing is that it doesn't matter which foot I'm on, as long as it is not someone else's.  (As you can tell, round dancing is a challenge for me.)   When I told our caller, Randy Dibble, at our last dance, he liked the line well enough to use on the mike.  
 Have a wonderful 2017 and come dance with us often!   Remember to check our website whenever the weather looks iffy.
