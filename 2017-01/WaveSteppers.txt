The Wave Steppers’ square dance classes are “dark” until March.  However, the free Wednesday night classes at the Tillamook Elks lodge, taught by club caller Joe Wrabek, resume January 4th.
 The 2017 dance schedule looks like this:  Club caller Joe Wrabek and line dance instructor Gwen Kiel will be doing the Club’s St.  Patrick’s Day dance March 12th, the Mother’s Day dance May 13th, the County Fair dance August 12th, and the Fall Dance October 14th.
 Jim Hattrick will be calling and cueing at the Spring Dance April 8th, and Harvey Hunsucker will call and cue at the Beach Dance July 8th; Mark Wheeler will be the caller, and Connie Clark the cuer, at the Elvis Dance Sept.  9th (which is also the Club’s anniversary dance); and Mike Stout will be calling at the Hawaiian Dance June 10th.  Mike’s wife Julie teaches Hawaiian dancing, so we’ll be doing that, too.
 The Wave Steppers’ dances are held the second Saturday of the month, on the Dance Floor at Garibaldi City Hall, 107 Sixth St. (at Acacia).  About two-thirds of the building’s second floor is a dance floor, and the Club has reportedly square danced there since the building was built in 1948.
