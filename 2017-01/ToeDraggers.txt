Ring in the New Year by joining the Toe Draggers for their “Putting On The Ritz” dance on January 6th, 7:30pm to 10:00pm.  Pre-Rounds 7:30 to 8:00, Square and Round Dance 8:00 to 10:00 with Plus Tip at mid-dance.  KC Curtis will be the caller with Bev Flint cueing.  The January 20th dance is a regular dance.  We will have an Experienced Clothing sale at both dances in January.  Be sure to check out the bargains. 
 Our students are now coming to our dances and will be finished with their lessons before Mid-winter.  They are a great group of people and we are looking forward to introducing you to them when you visit our dancers or when we visit your jamborees and Mid-Winter.
 Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from the Toes.  We hope your holidays are happy and we wish you safe travels.
