We are dark Christmas Day, BUT we are going to dance January 1st at 5:30 p.m.  That's a Sunday. So, please join us at the hall in Springfield for great dancing on the first day of the new year, 2017!  Tim Matteson calls and teaches all levels. We are right now in the midst of advanced lessons. Tim calls whatever level we are dancing. He's good, and we are so blessed to have him as our caller and teacher. He's happy he lives about 6 six minutes from the hall. It's also nice to have storage space and built in speakers too.

Kirby Goode is home on hospice which sounds ominous, but the hospice doctor told him to gain weight which may take him off hospice. That sounds positive to us. Kirby has COPD issues among other things. He's on oxygen which is helping his hair grow, making his cheeks nice and red and giving him a stronger voice. You can't say enough about good ol' oxygen for which we take for granted. 

We are getting more dancers coming out on Sundays at 5:30 p.m. Please join us!  We've heard dancers say we are a FUN group! True!
 
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from Spin Cycle Squares!
