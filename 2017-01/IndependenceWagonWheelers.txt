Independence Wagon Wheelerâ€™s history was made at our December 3 dance when Bill Francis Jr. asked Jamie Reinerkson to marry him, half way through a tip. Club members gave Jamie a veil made from a lace curtain and a bouquet from dried Hydrangeas. Bill was given a necktie to complete the newly engaged couples outfit.  It took George Hermann quite some time to get control of the dance after the proposal as everyone wanted to congratulate the happy couple. The club members felt so privileged to be included in this happy event. Happy Dancing. Linda Neuschwander
