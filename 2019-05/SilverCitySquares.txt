Thank you to everyone who attended our dance in March. We had a good time celebrating our late birthday.

Our teams are heavily into practice through April as competition is May 3rd & 4th! We will be at Silverton High School for competition this year. The competition moves back to Washington next year. The Silver Dragons will dance at Senior Level and the Silver Knights at Junior Level. We have two Junior Level Callers, one Pre-Teen Novice Level and one Novice Level caller. We also have one couple dancing Basic Level rounds and one Junior Level cuer. So please come support us - there is a lot to watch. See you at a dance soon. Petrina Buchheit
