Since the passing of our dear caller Joe Wrabek, our club is going through a reformation.  We will continue classes on Wednesdays at the Elks Lodge in Tillamook from 5:30 to 7:30, and monthly dances on the 2nd Saturday of the month 7:00 to 9:00 pm.  The May 11th dance will feature Don Hart calling and Gwen Kiel doing line dancing. 
 Don will continue teaching our classes on Wednesdays.  Spring is coming and beach trips are really fun and Dancing on Saturday Nights at the City Hall in Garibaldi make the trip HUGE......!!!!
