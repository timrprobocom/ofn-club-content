Our club dances twice a month on nearly every 2nd and 4th Friday of the month except for holidays or if in conflict with another event such as Mid-Winter Festival.  In March we held two fun dances, the first with Jim Hattrick calling and the second with Scott Zinser calling.  Jackie Gale is our cuer and can be found cueing for us at all of our dances unless she has another conflict.  We love having visitors.  You can always expect to have a great time dancing to our wonderful callers, our terrific cuer and our fun dancers.  Come dance with us.

We started off March with our St. Patrick’s Dance with a baked potato feed which always goes over well with our dancers and guests.  Jim called that night but while we did not have a very good turnout, Jim Hattrick did make it fun as always.  Our next dance with Scott Zinser was also not well attended but everyone enjoyed dancing to Scott and with each other.  We were happy to see Bill Gale is back on the floor after some much time unable to participate fully.  By the time you read this some of our snow birds will be back and we hope to see more squares on the floor.

In May we will be dark the 2nd Friday as we combine nights with the Whirl-A-Ways for our Mexican Fiesta Dance with taco bar.  Mike Kious will be calling and Christina Corelli cueing.  We always have a good turnout for this dance with two clubs hosting and often have a club or two visiting—who can resist a taco bar!  Hope to see you there, Saturday, May 11 at the Emerald Square Dance Center at 2095 Yolanda in Springfield.  For more information check our schedule on our website at singletrees.blogspot.com
