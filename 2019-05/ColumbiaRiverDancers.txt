Four years and counting.  What a great 4th anniversary dance. Great fun with many of our local clubs coming to support us and square dancing.  Adam Christman came over from Spokane to call for us.  We have him booked for number 5 as well.
 Our regular caller, Jim Hattrick, had a slight setback with some health problems in March and Darrell Kalmbach stepped in to help us with our lessons.  So a big thank you shout-out to him. Jim seems unstoppable and was back with us for our regular dance on the 23rd.
 On May 11th, Craig Abercrombie will be calling and Julie Stiers will cue for us.  On the 25th Jim will be calling our Memorial Day dance.  The weather should be nice and we look forward to having two great dances.
 While we plan to be dark over the summer, the club will be discussing where we will be visiting instead.  So, our club will be out and about.  Get your banners ready!
 We look forward to seeing you soon.
