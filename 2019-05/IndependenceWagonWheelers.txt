Spring-time is well underway, with summer just around the corner. We’re looking forward to another great year under the leadership of our new President Terry McCarty and Vice-President Eugene Ivy. Our special Easter Dance was on April 13. Did you notice any Easter bonnets? 

We will be finishing up the month of April with another Koast Krash at Yachats Inn with a Hillbilly/HeeHaw theme.  If it weren’t for the beautiful Pacific Ocean out the window, you might think that we had been transported to the HeeHaw stage in Nashville or to Appalachia of bygone day.  We are expecting ingenious and creative costumes!  We appreciate the organizers of this year’s Koast Krash, and are looking forward to the warm welcome and outstanding cooperation from the Yachats Inn management and staff.

It’s not too early to be encouraging friends, family, and co-workers to join us for Mainstream Lessons at Salem Hospital in September, coordinated by this year’s Good Scout and Membership Chair Dave (and Teresa) O’Neill. – details to follow in later OFN issues.

Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays of each month at Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall.  Dee and Bert Mackaman
