Thanks to all who participated in our annual Barn Sale. The square dance community is such a wonderful group of people to work and play with!

As the weather warms up, we look forward to using our outdoor dance floor. Our Pirate themed play and dance helped pay off the expenses of the outdoor dancing area, so thanks to all who came out and supported it and risked their lives to hang out where pirates are known to lurk.

May will bring our annual Mystery Trip. Young and Robert are cooking up another great experience for us.  If you haven’t gotten your ticket yet, call Young and reserve your seat, as the bus takes off on May 11th, whether you are on it or not! We had the privilege of hosting a Mystery Trip dance group from Lebanon on the 5th Saturday in March. What a fun dance that was! Large dances have a higher energy and George Hermann did a great job of calling that one.

In June, we are looking forward to another great dance on Father’s Day. Adam Christman will be calling that for us this year and he is a great caller! That will be on a Sunday, June 16th, from 1-5 PM. Look for the flyer in the OFN.

Dan Nordbye will be doing some high energy mainstream dances this year at the Boring Barn on Monday nights from 7-9 PM. Look for our flyer with the dates for those events.

Looking for some different dance skills? Our club will be offering line dance lessons taught by Lynn Wunische. She will offer them on Wednesday afternoons and Thursday evenings to see what time works out the best. Or maybe we will have two groups going!

Come on out! It is never boring at the Boring Barn!
