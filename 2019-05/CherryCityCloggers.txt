Cherry City Cloggers continue to clog along faithfully. Our attendance at weekly dances remains strong and we have three very accomplished dancers who are instructing.

We are gearing up for the demo season and will soon have our Demo List confirmed so that part of our weekly sessions will be devoted to polishing these dances. We recently did a demo for Cloverdale Elementary school. This was a fun time for all including the children as a short teach was presented and the children were encouraged to dance with us. We are in hopes that this kind of demo activity will motivate the younger generation to pursue the art of clogging.  Georganne
