Greetings from Yreka,
By the time you read this we will have hosted the council dance. I want to say a big thank you every one who attended and made the dance a success. It's count down time for us. A little over two months until Gold Diggers with Lawrence Johnstone  The dance format will be Mainstream, Plus and Advanced. Sarge & Cici  Glidewell will be cuing the rounds for us. If you have attended dances with our featured caller and cuer you know you will be in for a great time We have a new update about the dance. Some of you may remember in the past we raffled off a custom necklace, You may have one. Great news! we will be raffling off another. Look for it being displayed at our upcoming dances and maybe at a few other dances. Tickets will be $5.00 each or 5 for $20.00. You do not have to be present to win. We hope to hold Gold Diggers and our birthday dance at Evergreen Elementary School but this has not ben finalized yet. feel free call myself, Sherrie, or our president Marcia if you want or need more info. Also remember Gold Diggers will be on 4th Saturday this year June 22. Hope you will attend.
