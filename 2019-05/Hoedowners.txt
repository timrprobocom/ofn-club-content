Oh my goodness did you attend the Hoedownerâ€™s Mr. Potato Head Dance on March 9th?  I mean Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head actually attended, danced, visited and dined, just a charming couple.  The buffet table was heaving with baked potatoes and all the trimmings.  Apparently the Potato Heads were not offended as we dined on russets and they are sweet potatoes.
 The 16th of March found the Hoedowners holding their annual club meeting in the Aloha Grange dining room.  It was a potluck and as usual the food was great.  Valley Squares were invited to attend and then Hoedowners went upstairs and held visitation to the Valley Square Dance.
 One week later on the 23rd of March, we had our March Madness Dance to celebrate the American tradition of competitive college basketball.  Everyone was encouraged to wear their favorite team gear.  It was particularly exciting since the Oregon Ducks were still playing.  As it often happens now a day, March Madness is not over until April so the final results are still unknown. I hope your bracket was a success.  We had a wonderful crowd and thanks to all who joined us.  A special shout out to members from the new Oak Hills Square Dance Club.
 Looking ahead, on May 11th, just seis dias after de cinco de mayo, we will have our Fiesta Dance featuring a Nacho's & Taco Bar after the dance.  On May 25th we do an early observation of Memorial Day with our patriotic themed Red, White & Blue Dance.
