Hi Everyone!

Don’t forget~On May 4 and 5, the State Federation Meeting is in our Council. The May 4 Officer/Delegate Meeting will be held at 2385 Table Rock Rd. The “Crock Pot” Potluck will be held from 5:45 to 6:30 at the Rogue Valley Square Dance Center on Table Rock Rd. The May 5th Meeting will be at the Rogue Valley Square Dance Center at 9:00am on Sunday. The clubs in the Council have sign up sheets for the crock pot dinners and other foods needed for the Potluck.  Check with your representative and sign up or if you have a favorite crock pot meal, bring it along. There is never too much food. We will need main dishes, side dishes, salads and desserts.

There is a Council dance on May 31, 2019 at the Josephine County Square Dance Center.  

The next Council meeting will be June 4, 2019 at Round Table Pizza in Poplar Square.
