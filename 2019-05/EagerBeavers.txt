May is the month for installation of officers, the back bone of the club that keeps it functioning.  Remember to thank your volunteers, your club would not succeed without them.  Our new board is as follows:  Sally and Mike Duyck - Presidents; Karen and Ferrous Steinka - Vice Presidents; Dolores Fullmer - Treasurer;  Marguerite Morin - Secretary; TVC delegates - Leslie Tallman and John Semm.  All of us appreciate these members who step forward and volunteer their time to the club.  
 Our Plus classes are continuing and the students are doing quite well.  We have already welcomed three new members to our club. If you have square dance outfits you no longer want there are new and some old dancers who would love to have them.  I was reminded of this when I was asked where to find a silver and a gold petticoat.  Take your unwanted outfits to the next trade or sale event.  You may find something you want. I really need to get that extra stuff out of my closet!
 Find a way to celebrate Holidays in May.  You can wear an outfit that reminds you of the day or give flowers to a friend to enjoy. Several clubs have special dances with a May holiday as a theme such as Cinco de Mayo, Mothers Day, or Memorial Day. 
 Plan ahead to support your local clubs and for some good dancing.  The Hayshakers Anniversary Dance is May 17th at the Pacific Grange: TVC/PAC Fundraiser for Alzheimerâ€™s, Oak Grove Community Club, May 19th.
 We dance every Monday afternoon, even on holidays except Christmas and New Years.  Our callers keep us on our toes each week, always seeming to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  During lessons our schedule is 12:00 - 1:15 class, then 1:15 - 3:00 pm plus and rounds at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
