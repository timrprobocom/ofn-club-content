The Ramblers held our annual membership meeting on April 13. We reviewed another successful year for our small but mighty club. We elected the following Board members:
 
President: Jeff Knapp
Secretary: Tiffany Naemura
Treasurer: Tara O’Neil
Member at large: Jim Pettycrew
Member at large: Tony Doxtater.
 
We are looking forward to our Graduation Dance on Saturday, May 11, from 7:30 to 9:30 pm at the Oak Grove Community Hall. Professor Ian Craig will be calling. Our theme is Mad Plaid Grad—dazzle us with your weirdest and wildest plaid combinations. We will have assorted hijinks to celebrate our Mainstream class’s graduation.
 
We’ll wind up our Spring Session with Don Wood calling on June 8, also from 7:30 to 9:30 at Oak Grove.
 
We’re dark in July and August but will return with a vengeance on September 14 with Kris Jensen (Albuquerque) calling.
 
We welcome all dancers—especially solo dancers and anyone interested in all-position dancing!
 
SYIAS!
 
Jeff Knapp
