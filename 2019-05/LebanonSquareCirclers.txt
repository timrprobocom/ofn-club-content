Our Mystery Trip on March 30 was a real "blast". We traveled to the Boring Barn in Boring, Oregon, and visited the Country Cutups. This 100 year old building has been made into a wonderful dance hall. George and Patty Herman were calling/cueing and dancers from Corvallis Squares, Albany Timber Twirlers, Sweet Home Squarenaders and Salem Swinging Stars were on the bus.  (See the picture.)
April 6 was our Hippie Dance with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  Lots of fun costumes!  Our Cinco de Mayo dance will be on May 4, and we'll be serving tacos at the break time. 

Now itâ€™s the countdown to Strawberry Festival the first week in June. Our activities begin on May 31 with the Trails End dance -- callers and cuers from the floor. There will be a Spaghetti Dinner on Friday night and potluck on Saturday night. We always have a float for the parade on Saturday morning. Than our Saturday Strawberry Festival Dance will feature Dan Nordbye calling and Jackie Gale cueing -- strawberry shortcake served at the break as usual. This fun weekend will include our super Silent Auction, an Experienced Clothing Sale, other prizes, and a Sunday morning breakfast.  Don't miss all the fun!  See you in a square! Marilyn York
