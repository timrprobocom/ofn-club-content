We’d like to remind you of the Teddy Bear Parade May 11th, 10:00 at 10th & Main in Oregon City.  If your club is in the PAC, you’ve probably seen the PAC bear family of mom, dad and baby bear?  I’m sure they will be at the parade.  You too can come and participate at the parade.  Don’t forget to bring a new bear.  They will be donated to a very worthy cause.

May 19, we are co-hosting an Alzheimer’s benefit dance at the Oak Grove Community Club.  This will be quite a large dance, with basket raffles and baked goods.  See our flyer in the “Special Dances” section of this magazine. 

June 1st, the Cut-Ups and Hoppers will be in the Starlight Parade.  Come on down and watch, or see it on television.

We’ll also have a new council Secretary, Eileen Pettycrew starting at our annual pot-luck picnic June 17th, North Clackamas Park.  You’ll be there, right?  You are all invited.  Come about 6:PM at North Clackamas Park.
