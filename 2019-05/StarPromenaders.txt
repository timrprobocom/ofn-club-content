The next “Game Night” will be May 10. What a lot of fun we have. Come out and join us. It is a “Hoot.” If you don’t play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on or if there is some other game you would like to play, let us know. We are open to most any table game. We always have a potluck with a theme. The theme for the next “Game Night” is back to the beginning with “Mexican.”

Wayne is back and will be doing Advanced classes and workshops until they head South again in the fall. If he is not able to do a Wednesday, Phil will do his Wednesday, MS/Plus Workshop. Either way, Wednesdays are great fun.

On May 11, the Stars will “Honor Our Mom’s.” Dean Black will call Advanced from 630-730 and MS/Plus after Bob does pre-rounds at 730pm. Should be great time.

The Annual BBQ Bash at Mary Moody’s is scheduled for May 27th. It is always a fun time. After so many high energy events – such as Pear Blossom, Buckeroo Roundup & Boatnik – everyone is running on the auxillary tank. This picnic is an excellent way to “unwind” and catch your breath for the next one – Diamond Lake.

Preparations for Diamond Lake are coming along nicely. Everything seems to be on schedule. Get your ribbons for a great time.
