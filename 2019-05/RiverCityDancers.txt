In February we had a club visitation to TriSquares MardiGras Dance, and in March, they paid us a return visit. We also had visitations in March from Chaps and Petticoats who came all the way from Aloha, and also a group of dancers from Silver City Squares came for a visit. 

River City Dancers have visitations to other clubs every month. If your club is not active in attending visitations, we encourage you to do so. This is a “ win win “ situation for both clubs by increasing revenue , increasing dance attendance, and introducing some dancers to new callers and new locations Come see us. We love having visitors.

Sunday April 7 our River City Riders held a fundraiser dance in our hall for Sharon Driscoll which we supported and attended. We also had our fabulous 50’s dance April 13.

Our dances in May  will be our regular dances the second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community Center 42nd and Jackson in Milwaukie.
