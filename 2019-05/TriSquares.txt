In March we had an entertaining Mainstream graduation with three students joining our club, adding to some students with previous dancing experience who had joined during lessons earlier.  Also we had a great visitation to the River City Dancers in Portland, earning one of our banners back.
 In May we are looking forward to the scenic drive out to Boring to visit the Country Cut-Ups where our own Terry Halley will be calling the dance.  
 Also in May we have two dances scheduled at Tri Squares in Tigard:  on Saturday May 11th “Fiesta Time”, and on Friday May 24th “Stars and Stripes” with Terry calling and Sandra Pinion cuing.  PreRounds are at 7:30, Plus tip at 7:45, Mainstream 8-10, with 4th tip Plus.  Break at 10:00.  Please come and visit.
