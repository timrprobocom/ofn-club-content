We held two dances in March with two squares of dancers attending both.  We danced to recorded music to such callers as Darryl Lipscomb and Bronc Wise to name only two.  Our fearless leader Fred Beisse always finds good callers willing to share their gifts with us.  We are looking forward to having Dan Nordbye call for us once a month while he is here in the area and also we hope to have Kris Jensen from Albuquerque call once or twice in the fall.  If you like to dance advanced and are in the area, please come join us

We dance in Hall B at the Emerald Square Dance Center, 2095 Yolanda in Springfield approximately twice a month.  Our schedule is erratic so best to check before driving over.  For more information please see our schedule and other information on our website at CAS-SC.yolasite.com
