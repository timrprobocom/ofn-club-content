The March 30th, fifth Saturday TVC Spring Fling Dance featuring Randy Dibble calling and Jeanine Norden cueing was a great success.  The dance was co-hosted by the Mix N' Mingle who also won the TVC banner for having the highest percentage of their club present.
 On May 19th a dance sponsored by Tualatin Valley Council & Portland Area Council will be held to benefit the Alzheimer’s Association.  All proceeds will go directly to them.  The Oak Grove Community Club is donating the hall and Caller MC Dan Nordbye with Cuer MC Julie Stiers are donating their time.  Alzheimer’s Association Benefit Dance May 19, 2019 2:00 - 5:00 p.m., Oak Grove Community Center, 14496 SE Cedar Avenue, Portland, OR.  Donations are welcome and tax deductible.
