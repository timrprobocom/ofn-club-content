On March 30, 2019, the Emerald Empire Area Council and Cascade Callers and Cuers Association called and cued had the area's benefit dance for Camp Alma, a 103 acre retreat and rehabilitation center for veterans suffering from PTSD and other issues.  This is one more way to thank and honor our veterans.  Over $1,700 was raised.  Representatives from Camp Alma were on hand to share information, answer questions and on stage to receive a check.  They were most appreciative.  The exciting part was that they watched square and round dancing and decided they just may join us this fall! 

Our next scheduled dance is June 29.

Keep on calling and cueing for fun!
