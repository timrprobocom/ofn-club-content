Happy spring to our dancing friends.  Hope the better weather agrees with all of you. I like it a whole bunch more than the snow and cold weather.
We are happy to announce that we are switching to a summer schedule in June. We will be dancing from 6:30-8:30 p.m. until the end of August. We will throw in our birthday party in June also.
There will be a guest cuer for the last evening in June so Stephanie and Leonard can attend a cuers clinic at Circe 8 Ranch in Cle Elum. They should learn a lot and come back with all sorts of new things for us to learn and dance. Should be a fun summer.
We have voted for Federation officers and re-elected the current club officers, so we are set for a while again. Always nice to get some business taken care of and then continue with the fun of dancing to favorites afterwards. Marilyn Schmit
