Our dances in March were a blast.  One of our TTS couples returned after a somewhat lengthy absence from our dances.  They were a little rusty after coming back, but they remembered quite a lot on their return.  We also had  a number of visitors from the Toe Draggers.  A new student from our previous dance returned, and he did very well too.  At our 2nd  dance in March, we gave another crash course to another visitor couple from out of the area.  They did so well!  We had a barrel of fun and laughs at these dances.
 Our dances in May are on the 8th and on the 22nd.
 A reminder: if we have less than a square at any of our dances, we may end the dance early or cancel the dance.
Our club continues to be a fun place where friends gather, have some food and practice moves they want to work on before the weekend dances.  Lots of belly laughs to go around.  We would love to have you come join us!
 See you around in a square.
