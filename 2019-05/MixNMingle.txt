The March 30th dance was the first TVC for some of us.  We were helping sponsor the dance, as well as supporting our caller, Randy Dibble, and cuer, Jeanine Norden.  A number of Valley River Dancers were there supporting Randy and Jeanine, too.  There were lots of callers, cuers, and their partners amongst the dancers.
 The hall was well-filled with enthusiastic dancers.  We so enjoyed seeing people that we hadn't seen for years, as well as all those that we see often, and we always welcome new acquaintances.  One friend even told me that he enjoys reading these columns.  What a morale booster!
 We were impressed with the bounteous pot luck.  Afterwards cleaning up took only a short time.
