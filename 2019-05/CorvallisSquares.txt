Our dances at Gleneden Beach on March 8 and 9 were a lot of fun, and we were delighted to have several guests join in the weekend activities, including a potluck on Saturday. The weather was unseasonably pleasant, after a rainy start! Looking ahead to May, we'll have two dances coming up, and look forward to some fun times together. Karen
