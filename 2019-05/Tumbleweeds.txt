Our Club dances every Friday with our wonderful callers Daryl Clendenin, Jim Hattrick and Craig Abercrombie.  Lessons were over the end of March, so our regular Mainstream Dance started in April at 11:00 AM

We  have plenty of free and easy parking so come and meet old and new friends in a very nice air-conditioned building.
