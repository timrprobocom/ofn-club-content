We’re going to have another great board starting in June, with President, Gene Neils, V-P, Rainy Evans, Secretary, Patricia Neils and Treasurer, Melissa James.  Council Delegates Jim Schira and Mary Theirl are celebrating 14 years of running unopposed.  (Is there a dangle for that?)  Of course we’ll have our more or less permanent appointed crew of Parker Parkit (valet), Cal Amari (club cook), Pat Pettifogger (legal counsel), Armando Armbuster (club bouncer), Debbie Debit (bookkeeper), Gerry Geranium (club florist) and Prudy Pruner (parking lot arborist).  And you’ll still have my helpers and I putting together this news.  Come on out any Wednesday night and meet us all.
