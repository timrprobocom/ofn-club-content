Greetings from the Buzzin' Bees. We have had a busy couple of months with dancing, visitations and our anniversary dance. We had a fantastic visit from a group from Everett, the Dudes and Dates. They came to us, more than 30 strong as a mystery trip and we greatly enjoyed their fellowship and enthusiastic dancing. We had a Lasagna dinner with them and a big Thank you goes out to Linda Curtis for her organizational skills and to all of the Bees for making it a success.  I am writing this before our anniversary dance but I am sure it will be a blast. 

We have 2 dances planned for May. We dance on the first and third Saturdays at the Hazel Dell Grange. Pre-rounds /pre plus at 7pm with Mainstream at 7:30. Every third tip is plus. See you on the floor!
