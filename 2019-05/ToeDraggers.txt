May Day! May Day!
 Stop “horsing” around, it’s time to get your Kentucky Derby Hat ready for the Toe’s “Fillies & Lillies” dance on May 3rd.  It’s sure to be a foot stomping good time!  May 17th will be a regular dance.
 Our caller is KC Curtis (Linda) & our cuer is Bev Flint (Harlan)  They both do an excellent job, and make all our dances extra fun!  Come out and see us soon. 
Happy Easter one and all!
