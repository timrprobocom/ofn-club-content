Oh my, but we had fun with Kris Jensen, national caller from Albuquerque last month.  Many dancers came down from Portland to dance, partake of our wonderful potluck and bid on silent auction items.  There were dancers from the local clubs in attendance as well. Kris also called for Cast-A-Shadow's advanced club while she was here..  She also called for Spin Cycle Squares before heading home to New Mexico.  Kris and her brother, Kurt, and sister-in-law, Lorna, spent Thanksgiving with Kris and Kurt's mom down in Medford. 
 
Spin Cycle Squares is a fairly small club, but we know how to have fun and take care of business.  We do have elections of officers coming up and encourage everyone to think about taking an office for even just a year.  As they say, 'many hands make light work', and this goes for all of our clubs as well.
 
An appreciation monetary gift was given to Tim Matteson, our teacher and caller.  Tim calls and teaches each Sunday.  We do pay his ASCAP/BMI and CallerLab fees, but that is all we can afford.  Tim calls and teaches Beginners through Advanced and stretches us mentally and physically.  It's never dull that's for sure.  Thanks so much Tim!  You are appreciated more than you know!
 
Sally Brown dances with us and is in charge of used clothing at the hall.  One Sunday she spent hours priming and painting the panels surrounding the used clothing area.  She danced a couple of tips before heading home exhausted.  We appreciate Sally's tending to the used clothing and her innovative ideas for sales and ways to get money for the hall.  Thanks Sally!  Your efforts are much appreciated! 
 
We encourage and invite all dancers to join us Sundays evenings at 5:30. 
 
Happy dancing!
