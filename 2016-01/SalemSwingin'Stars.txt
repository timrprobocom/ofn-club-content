Merry Christmas & Happy New Year to all!!

Our New Dancers are off to a great start. Thank you to all of the Angels out there. You make it possible for the New Dancers to gain confidence and have fun! We will graduate our 13 New Dancers on Wednesday January 13, just in time for Mid Winter.

January is a strange month for the Salem Swingin' Stars. We normally dance on the first and third Fridays of the month but the first Friday in January is New Year's Day and WE ARE DARK.

We will dance our Regular Mainstream Dance on January 15, but our fifth Friday Plus Dance would be January 29 and WE ARE DARK. Instead, join us at Mid Winter in Albany. Our schedule in February will be normal. See you all on the Dance Floor.
