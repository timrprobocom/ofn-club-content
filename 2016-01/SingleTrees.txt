I’m happy to report we had two really fun dances in November.  The first was on Friday, Nov. 13, traditionally a Black Cat Dance.  We decided not to have a Black Cat dance as our membership is getting older and climbing around on scaffolding to place the black lights is more difficult.  So​,​ we had a regular dance, but it was called by one of our favorite callers, Don Marshall, who came up from Roseburg.  This will likely be the last dance he calls for us as he is leaving for Texas next spring.  Boo-hoo!  We’ll miss him.  We had a fine time at the dance with him and Jackie Gale calling and cueing.  We’ll miss you, Don.   It was a privilege to have you call for us.

Quite a few of us attended the always fun and delicious Turkey Dinner and Dance in Sweet Home with Jim Hattrick calling his best and exciting the crowd of well fed dancers.  Jackie was cueing there as well.  Are we happy to see here doing her thing!  We always know we’ll get to dance to some great recordings and choreography!

On Friday, Nov 27 we had Craig Abercrombie with us again calling to some really great music, and our club cuer, Jackie Gale, did her best as always.  It was a small group but a fun one! 

We hope to see many dancers out in January in the new year for the two dances we will host with Terry Halley calling the second Friday and George Hermann calling the 4th Friday before Mid-Winter.  And of course we are all waiting for Mid-Winter 2016 where we will get to dance to our favorite callers and see all our friends from across Oregon and beyond.

Happy New Year to all our fellow devotees of square dancing!
