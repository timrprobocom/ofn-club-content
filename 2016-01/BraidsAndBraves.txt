Three of our new dancers came to our 'We Give thanks' Dance. We had three squares on the floor and enjoyed guest caller, Bruce Lowther. His partner, Judy Russell also cued some rounds to give our own Sandra Pinion a little break. It was also nice to visit with Myrt and Evan Powell, former members who dropped by the dance. 

We had two visitations this month. The raid at Lebanon was a fun surprise. Then at the Willamette Squares, which always has great food and good friends, besides the good calling of Sandy Harris and cueing of our good friend, Jackie Gale, we recovered one of our banners. Merry Christmas to all!
