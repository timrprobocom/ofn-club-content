PLUS, PLUS, ADVANCED. PLUS, PLUS, ADVANCED. That's the rhythm of the Valley River Dancers' New Year's Eve dance at the Maplewood Grange. Join us for an outstanding evening of dancing to Randy Dibble and Julie Stiers starting at 8 pm with an open dessert bar and toast at midnight.

Our annual Gospel Dance in November was a blast. Randy and Julie kept the full hall of dancers on our toes as we laced across, flutter wheeled and weaved without a hitch. 

As the holidays wrap up, we wish you many boxes, happy unwrap, and yellow rocks in abundance.
