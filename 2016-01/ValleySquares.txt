Valley Squares Basics lessons start with a Community Dance at Aloha Grange January 12th.  We are looking forward to meeting a new group of students as well as graduates of fall classes who want to further train those muscle memories so necessary for dancing.  Hope to see you and a horde of curious followers at 7pm.

We started the month with our Trophy Dance.  Hoedowners won the trophy and the right to host the next dance.  We plan to recapture that trophy, and hope we have lots of competition from multiple clubs to sweeten the victory.

Our Turkey and Thanksgiving Dance reminded us of all the blessings in our lives, particularly the friends and fun we have encountered through square dancing.

We ended the month of November with a visitation to Valley River.   Fifteen dancing friends met for dinner and joined 6 more members of our community at Chehalem Grange, experiencing a great night of fun and challenging choreography.  The previous Friday we had the double pleasure of dancing to National Caller, Dan Nordby along with our own Julie Stiers, and devouring pumpkin pie at the Pumpkin Pie Dance.

Please join us for our New Beginnings dance January 2 and Celebrate Diversity Dance January 16th.
