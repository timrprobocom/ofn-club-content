<h3>Mid-Winter</h3>

A fun Mid Winter Festival has been planned and is all ready to go.  To start 
things off will be a demonstration dance at Heritage Mall, Friday from 
11:00am to 12:00pm with caller Leonard Snodgrass. Come dressed in Square 
Dance attire.  A free bus or trolley will be available to take dancers from 
motels, hotels and RV parks to Heritage Mall, or for dining and sighting on 
Friday and Saturday from 10:00am to 10:00pm.  At 6:30pm line up for the

Colors and our National Anthem.

Many fun events are planned for the Youth, a fun night at Abby's Legendary 
Pizza for pizza and square dancing.  The Youth table in the mainstream hall
