Our Christmas dance and Silent auction was a success. George did all singing calls and it was great. In January, our first dance on January 2 we will have a different caller as George has a family commitment he cannot miss.

Coming up in February is our â€œMARDI GRAS DANCE". This should be great fun. You can dress for Mardi Gras or Square dance attire. We will have good food and lots of fun. Come join us in January and February for dancing fun. Also, don't forget we will have Dan Nordbye on April 11, 2016. Come join for a fun time with a national caller.

Our lessons are going very well. Our new dancers are up to level 42 as of the first part of December. We are very proud of them.
