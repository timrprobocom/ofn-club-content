We honored our Veterans on Veterans Day and invited them to dance for free!  They were asked to stand and were recognized for their service.  Thank you all!

Our club enjoyed a visitation from the Ping Pong Plus Club, who received a banner for bringing their caller, KC Curtis and ten dancers. They also dance on Monday afternoons so we were especially pleased they came.

Eager Beaver member and the eldest dancer in our area, Genevieve Churchill, turned 104 on November 22nd.  She is currently living in adult care after breaking her hip in July.  If you would like to send her a card, her new address is 13200 SW Village Glenn Drive, Tigard, OR  97223-6040.

January brings us into a new year with no mistakes in it.  Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if we could keep it that way but that is an impossible dream so the next best thing is to learn from them and not make the same ones again.  History matters. 

We have exciting lesson plans for afternoon Plus Classes which start February 15th from noon to 2:00 pm.  We have three top instructors: Jim Hattrick - 3rd Mondays, Daryl Kalmbach - 2nd & 4th Mondays, and Daryl Clendenin - 1st & 5th Mondays. There will be a fifteen minute break at 1:15.  At 1:30 students will have the opportunity to dance two tips with the club using what they have just learned. 

Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week seems to have some new twist.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons: Rounds 1:00 - 1:30; Plus 1:30 - 3:15 PM, Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.  We dance on holidays too so if you have a day off come join us.
