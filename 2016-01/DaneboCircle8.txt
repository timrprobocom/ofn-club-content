We look forward to December 19th's big Christmas gathering with the Whirl-A-Ways, Single Trees and Wolf Pack.  It's a plus when clubs work together.
 
Our club is small but we are mighty.  We look forward with positive anticipation to 2016 in hopes that we will increase in size and have members willing to run for office.  That's hard for all clubs nowadays, but we encourage people to really think about it and step up to the plate no matter which club is yours. 
 
We have anywhere from 4 - 5 squares of new dancers, many of which are 'retreads'.  That's the nice piece of our activity when friends come back to the fold to dance with us.  And, it's always wonderful to welcome newcomers to this fun activity.
 
We encourage everyone to buy your Mid-Winter ribbon(s).  It's really not expensive to have 2 - 3 days of dancing fun with others and dance to nationally and internationally known callers, cuers and clogging prompters.  Mid-Winter is the last week of January of 2016.  We look forward to marching in the grand parade and connecting with friends and making new ones.
 
Keep on dancin'
