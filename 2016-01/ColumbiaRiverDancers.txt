During this first year of the Columbia River Dancers other clubs have been very supportive of us.  So much so that we have eight banners and some shirts out to other clubs before we had banners.  The goal this coming year is to get the banners back by returning the favor of the visits.  The first was a visit to the Happy Hoppers in November. So, look out for us this year. We do appreciate the support given to us to help us get through our first year.

As we look forward to the New Year, we are excited to have Jim Hattrick as our regular caller on the fourth Saturday of the month.  We are not sure of the caller and cuer for the 9th of January, but Jim will be calling on the 23rd.

Our new dancer classes begin the first Wednesday of the month and are in synchronization with the Happy Hopper classes that start the first Monday of the month.  Dancers have the opportunity to get a lesson at one club and reinforce it at the other club.  We have seen many of our new dancersâ€™ progress very quickly with this arrangement.  

Lastly, many of the Columbia River Dancers will be trekking to Mid-winter at the end of the month.  We look forward to squaring up with our friends at the festival.
