Happy New Year from the Buzzin Bees.  

New year, new ideas. We have made a change to our dance format. We started in December with the first dance of the month as a Workshop dance  and the second dance is a regular themed dance. So on the first Saturday we hope you will join us to perfect your main stream skills, work out moves that are seldom called, or bring your lesson people to hone their skills and gain some floor time. On the third Saturday we will have themes such as our upcoming Pajama dance on 1/15/16. Our workshop dance will be casual dress and the themed dance will be square dance attire.

We will be starting lessons again on Sunday, January 10, 2016 from 6-8pm at the Hazel Dell Grange.  First lesson is free. We are enjoying dancing to some  different music with our new caller KC Curtis and I  am looking forward to lessons with him. 

We had a theme dance in December where we took in donations for several local assisted living facilities where the majority of the residents are on state assistance. We got an amazing number of lap blankets, slippers, puzzle books, shampoo and lotions. We will deliver the goodies to Arbor Ridge assisted living and to Woodland assisted living. We have such a generous group of people in our club. I am proud to be a member of this group. We are looking forward to Mid-winter. Hope to see you there. 

Sincerely,
Debbie Broers
