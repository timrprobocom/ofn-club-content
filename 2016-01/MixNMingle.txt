As we start 2016 we have great memories of dancing to Randy Dibble and Jeanine Norden and look forward to another year with them.  We feel lucky to have both of them.

Randy's calling is always lively and fun, with a wide variety of music.  All of his choices work well for his choreography.  Jeanine cues many styles from old favorites, songs heard less often, new selections, and everything in between.  Jeanine and her husband Paul are always ready to make up a square.  

Besides Randy's and Jeanine's excellence in providing a night's engaging dancing, their personalities brighten each gathering.  Come join us for great evenings with friendly dancers.

Happy New Year to all!
