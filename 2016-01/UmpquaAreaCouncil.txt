Most of the Buckeroos, Timber 8’sand Dancing Friends were  decked out in combinations of red, white and blue marching in our Veteran’s Day Parade in Roseburg.  Although the rain drizzled and sprinkled on us while we were waiting our turn to actually start marching the parade route, the rain clouds smiled on us just in time to begin the parade and we made it through the entire route without getting wet.

We are excited about our students who are taking lessons this year at the Barn and are looking forward to the Umpqua Area Council’s New Dancer’s Dance. You won’t want to miss our dance coming up in January.   Circle January 10th on your brand new 2016 calendar and plan to join us at the Barn for the dance.  It will be held January 10th, 2016  (Sunday) from   2:30-5:00 pm at the Buckeroo Barn.   The tips will be called at the new dancer level, so plan to join us for a Sunday afternoon of laid back dancing.  We love the energy of new dancers and look forward to having you visit us regardless if you are a new dancer, an old timer or somewhere in between.  Let your students know about the dance because it will be a perfect trial run for mid-winter if they haven’t been venturing out to other clubs to dance and a great way for them to get extra floor time and experience dancing to a different caller.
