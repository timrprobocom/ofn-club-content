The Muddy Frogs will be continuing lessons on January 3 and 10 at the Community Building in Milton-Freewater, but there will be no third Sunday dance and no lessons on January 17, 24 or 31, as Bill and Neva Reid, our intrepid caller and cuer, will be in Hawaii, soaking up the sun, while the rest of us will be wishing we could join them!  Lessons will resume as usual on Sunday afternoons on February 7 from 2:00-3:30 for mainstream and 3:45-5:00 for social ballroom dance. 

The third Sunday in February will be our anniversary dance from 3:00-5:00 at the Community Building.

We would love to have you join us!  And Happy New Year!

Keep on dancinâ€™!
