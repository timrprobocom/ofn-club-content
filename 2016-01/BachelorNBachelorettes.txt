What a great time we had on our mystery trip to the Cougar Squares Dec 5th.  We all got on the bus and never knew where we were to dance until we got there.  Because we hired a bus, rather than car pools, there was no information leak as to where we were going.  The total cost?  Our new bookkeeper, Debbie Debit, hasnâ€™t quite recovered her pallor yet, but we donâ€™t care; we had fun!  The Cougar Squares noted they had never seen so many from our club, to which I reminded our club that it was better to be looked over than overlooked.

Most of our club goes to Mid-Winter, and we hope you do, too.  Thereâ€™s something for everyone at Mid-Winter â€&ldquo; including an abundance of solo dancers.
