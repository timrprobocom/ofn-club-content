Happy 2016 from the Toes.  We ended our year with a great progressive dinner for the Toes with a Great Gatsby Theme.  We roared into the evening with great food, great fun and wonderful roaring twenties costumes.

Our grange was all decorated for the holidays by the club.  It’s an annual event for the Toes to gather at the hall, decorate it, and then go out to eat together afterwards.  That’s why we dance so hard.  We have to burn off the calories we consume at club activities.

December brought us into Rocking Around the Christmas Square, collection of toys for children, and a new dancer’s jamboree.  We found square dancing especially blessing our lives at the end of 2015.  

January 1st will start us out with our Black and Blue Ball, dance until you drop marathon dance with all singing calls.  How KC loves to sing.  Classes begin this month for Bev and Harlan Flint with Two Step Round Dance lessons on January 3rd.  The 6th follows with KC and Linda resuming our beginners’ lessons for square dancing.  We hope to see you at Mid-Winter Festival and at our Sadie Hawkins Dance on February 5th.

We are thankful for our square dancing friends, good health and a positive year ahead of us.  Happy New Year from the Toe Draggers.
