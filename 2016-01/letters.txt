<li><a>Irene James Obituary</a>
<div>
<p>
Ireme James passed away on October 30.
<p>
A retired school teacher and volunteer activist, Irene James passed away
Oct. 30, 2015, at Tanner Spring Assisted Living in West Linn. Her husband,
Chuck James; and daughter, Maureen Hodges preceded her in death. She is
survived by her grandson, Robert Johnston.
<p>
She was born in Portland,
the middle child of five, to Alois and Flossie Tedisch. Growing up
during the Great Depression, Irene learned to be thrifty and creative
all her life. She graduated valedictorian from Albany High School in
1947, then went on to get her teaching degree from the University of
Oregon. She taught many years and retired from Portland Public Schools
soon after her grown daughter, an only child, was murdered in 1987. She
worked through her grief and soon after she became a strong leader in
Parents of Murdered Children.
<p>
She and her husband, Chuck, were avid
recyclers, gardeners and environmentalists leading them to turn their
small acreage outside Tualatin into a nature reserve providing habitat
for wildlife including vulnerable bird species. As a skilled seamstress,
she created many complete outfits for underprivileged children. Her
love of nature, books, music and square dancing enhanced her life as
well as the lives of those around her. She was respected and loved
by all who knew her. She will be missed, but will never be far from
our hearts. A celebration of her life will be held at 2 PM Friday,
Jan. 22, 2015, at Metanoia Peace House, 2116 N.E. 18th Ave., Portland, OR
97212. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Parents of Murdered
Children, P.O. Box 515, Beaverton, OR 97075-0515 or Bonnie Hays Animal
Shelter, 1901 S.E. 24th Ave., Hillsboro, OR 97123.

<p>
To all Square Dancers,
<p>
Square dancing is <u><i>fun!</i></u> That is the one reason that we all do it -
for the <u><i>fun</i></u>. That being said, I think there are a couple of general
rules that would make it more enjoyable for all of us. First, the
square dancer should be able to dance. Not dancing when a square is
broken is not <u><i>fun</i></u>. To keep a square going, dancers need to be aware of
the capabilities of others in the square.  If you are in a square with
experienced dancers, a certain amount of “cutting up” is <u><i>fun</i></u> and is
expected.  If you are in a square with new dancers or challenged dancers,
you need to keep your cutting up to a level that does not bomb the square.
If you try it and the square bombs, don’t do it again.
<p>
Second and even more important, we have an obligation when angeling to
not confuse the students. Cutting up can confuse students, makes it harder
for the instructor and is not <u><i>fun</i></u> for those that are in a learning mode.
<p>
Third, we all enjoy dancing in the square that just sails through
the calls and allows us to dance to the best of our capabilities. One
square like that makes the whole dance <u><i>fun</i></u>.  Again, that being said,
we also have an obligation to the other members in our club who are
less skilled on the floor.  After all, you were not always the shining
example of square dance expertise that are now.  You learned by being in
squares with more experienced dancers.  When you see a square with new
or challenged dancers, don’t run and hide in the experienced square.
Spend one or two tips with those less experienced dancers. Sure, you
may not be able to cut up as much or dance at the level you would like,
but you will be giving the newer dancers the advantage of your experience
and expertise, just like others gave you when you were learning.
<p>
Last but by no means least, square dancing is <u><i>fun</i></u> - let’s keep it that way 
for all of our dancers. We all deserve to have some <u><i>fun</i></u>!
