Sunset Promenaders had a food drive at our November dances and the theme for the November 21st dance was “Giving Thanks”.

We are now having the Promenaders Plus dances on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Thursday each month.  The 5th Thursday only happens three times in the next year.  The Plus dance is working out well for us; it has been a whole year now that we have been having the Plus dances.  This Plus dance was started right after Norm Yoder retired from calling the Plus Knights for 30-years, and we have been doing this dance on the same days of the month as the Plus Knight’s.  Our Darrell Kalmbach and Ken Pratt have been doing a great job calling, cueing and doing a little teaching each night too.

In January the Sunset Promenaders will have a mainstream dance on the 2nd, and on the 16th the theme will be “Wild West” with chili and corn bread on the break menu. 

We hope everyone had a great Christmas and New Year holidays.
