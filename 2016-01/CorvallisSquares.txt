Happy New Year everyone! Our mainstream lessons continue this month, with Bruce Lowther instructing. We've attended some of the New Dancers' Dances with our students and it's been a fun and festive time. Our club is hosting a New Dancers' Dance on January 9 and we look forward to it.

Coming up in March is our annual Coast Trip, March 11 and 12, when we'll be dancing both nights at Gleneden Beach Community Club. All are welcome!
