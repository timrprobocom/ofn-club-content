Our November Ham Dinner Dance was well attended. Everyone who had dinner enjoyed a full ham dinner and then complained about being full for the dancing, but all dancers had a good time.

We have been doing visitations out to other clubs (we've been following mom with the Mid-Winter ribbon sales) and we have several more scheduled.

Most of our students have been getting out to the new dancer dances and having fun. They are very enthusiastic. For those who remember when my siblings and I started dancing - watch for Jasmine. She is smaller than we were (see picture in OFN) and is having as much fun as we do. If you get a chance, watch her do a fancier promenade with my dad. He really has to crouch down to go under her arms. See you in a square.
