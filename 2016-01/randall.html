<h3> Billie Smith<br>
Beachcombers<br>
South Coast Council</h3>

<p>
In the fall of 1963, Billie Smith and her husband Willie agreed to take square dance lessons offered by the Beachcombers
in Port Orford.  Their neighbors Albert and Ollie Britton had been after them for 3 years and they finally relented to
to just to get them off their backs.  After graduation the next spring, the Smiths became members of the club that would
become the social center of their lives until Willie&#39;s death in 1997.  Billie continues today giving of her time and
resoures as necessary to insure the club and activity prosper.

<p>
During the past half century plus, she has served as club president, vice president, secretary, treasure, and publicity
reporter.  She has represented the Beachcombers on the South Coast Council Executive Board and helped plan and put on 
three successful Summer Festivals on the South Coast of Oregon (1965, 1973, 1993).  But Billie's behind the scenes work
is really what sets her apart.  From baking 30 loaves of bread for a cold cut sandwich dinner to mowing the extensive
grounds around the dance hall, Billie has been the driving force and the one constant presence with the Beachcombers.
She still serves up the coffee and buys supplies for the club's popular fundraiser pancake breakfasts.  As club 
treasurer she holds a tight rein on funds and makes sure the bills get paid and deposits made.

<p>
The club built the dance hall on Nicholson Drive where the club has danced since 1959.  During that time many repairs,
paint jobs and roof coatings have taken place.  Billie has been high up on the roof many times (most recent in 2013 at
age 83!), mop in hand, directing others to get it done right.  She has worn out at least three riding lawn mowers
getting the grass cut before RVs moved in for the big weekend festivals.  Grass grows "thick and quick" in all that
winter rain!  South Coast weather is tough on paint jobs too and Billie has spent a lot of time with a paint brush in
her hand.  When membership and attendance fell, Willie and Billie paid the taxes on the building to make sure the 
dancers kept dancing.  When callers quit or moved along, they called and called until they found one willing to make
the drive to teach lessons or call a dance, many times paying the caller out of their own pocket.

<p>
But through it all the continued to love to dance with their friends and promote dancing to people they felt would 
enhance the activity and enable it to grow.  Billie believed in providing a good atmosphere and lots and lots of good
food.  Her cinnamon rolls were the main draw at many a dance, meeting or festival.  Her costume dance and parade outfits
were never to be missed.  From Daisy May to Dolly Parton, Billie always provided laughs for all in attendance.

<p>
She has instilled her love of dancing and service to your club in her two daughters and their husbands as well as two
granddaughters.  She's still working on her son and other grandchildren.

<h3>Ray &amp; Zola Jones<br>
Whirl-A-Ways<br>
Emerald Empire</h3>
<p>
Ray and Zola were both born in Eugene, Oregon and raised in the same rural community west of Eugene, and so are native
"webfoots".

<p>
They first learned to square dance while stationed in the US Air Force at Laredo, Texas, on the Rio Grande River and
border of Mexico in 1972.  The name of the club located on the base was the "Rio Ramblers", and they got to square dance
in a bull ring in the Mexican town just across the river, this earning a "Bull Ring" badge and an "International" badge
for dancing in two separate countries in one evening!

<p>
In 1980, after retiring from 20 plus years in the Air Force and moving home to Eugene, they joined the "River Road Mixers"
square and round dance club.  In 1981 they were asked to be on the Mid-Winter Festival Committee, and have served on the
committee continuously for 34 years, including as Festival Chairman in 1988.  The Mixers club disbanded in 1986, so in 
1987 they joined the Whirl-A-Ways and remain active to this day.

<p>
Raymond was president of the Emerald Empire Council in 1985, 1986, and 1992.  He was chairman of the area's annual 
benefit dance in 1986.  In 1992-93, Zola was the State Reporter for the Oregon State Federation.  In 1991 to 1994, they
served on the Oregon Trail Board as Program Chairman for Oregon's 1994 National Square Dance Convention held in Portland.
Ray retired from his current occupation in 1997 and he and Zola began traveling in their motorhome, including every winter,
February to May, to Southern Arizona, dancing in Yuma with the many Oregon dancers who winter there, and also dancing in
Mesa and Tucson.  In 2001, they had the honor of being appointed Oregon Goodwill Ambassadors and served in this position
for 5 years, taking Oregon square, round, and clog dancing information wherever they traveled.  They also served again
on the program committee for the Oregon National Square Dance Convention in 2005.  From 2009 to 2012 Zola served as
State Historian for the Oregon State Federation, and Raymond served as State Federation President in 2011-2012 from being
elected First Vice President in 2010.  Also in 2012 Zola was elected by the Emerald Empire Area Council as Area Delegate
to the State Federation, a position they currently serve in.

<p>
They have held offices in their club, and Zola has been the club OFN Reporter and club delegate to the council for several
years, and they also help with the council's activities.  They continue to attend and help with the Whirl-A-Ways club
activities, and always support their club and council.

<p>
They have thoroughly enjoyed over the years dancing in the different areas of Oregon by way of festival visitations,
State Federation meetings, and special dance weekends, and seeing towns they might not have been to before, and always 
the best part meeting other dancers and sharing this great activity we're all involved in.

<h3>Nancy & Brice Baker<br>
Willamette Squares<br>
Mid-Willamette Area</h3>
<p>
As founding and charter members of the Willamette Squares in Salem, Nancy and Brice Baker have been quiet, strong,
dependable leaders of the club for over 20 years. They always assist or lead in the recruitment of new dancers, especially
as lesson coordinators for club square and round dance lessons for the last six years.  They are always first to the 
dance hall to open for lessons every week from September through May or June.  They always actively, smilingly encourage
new square dancers, including their own children and grandchildren, who took up square dancing through their support.
<p>
The Bakers are vice presidents of Willamette Squares and have been for as long as anyone can remember.  In this non-glory
job -- not sought by others but welcomed by Nancy and Brice -- they purchase and keep stock of all club supplies and
decorations, manage kitchen duty assignments and activities, and greet dancers at every Willamette Squares dance and
lessons.  Brice is also the club photographer.
<p>
The Baker's reliability and consistency attending all club meetings, club dances, visitations, and demo dances, as well
as serving on committees and taking on other club responsibilities as needed, is greatly appreciated by all club members.
Their love for the club is evident.  They are the "glue" that holds this small club together.  They are virtually always
the first to arrive at the dance hall for Willamette Squares dances to help set up, decorate, and provide food and snacks
for the dancers.  Often, half of the table decorations and at least a third of the food is provided by them.  The annual
Thanksgiving Holiday Dinner Dance is always chaired by Nancy and Brice (18 years now!).  They coordinate the food for the
feast and bring turkey, ham, side dishes and dessert.  It would not be the great spread that it is without their help and
contributions.
<p>
In addition to constructing a 14-foot May Pole, with twelve streaming ribbons, for our annual May Pole Dance, Brice made
sturdy, all-weather sandwich board signs to sit on the sidewalk outside the dance hall to advertise our dances.  Really,
the things the Bakers do to help the club to survive, to run smoothly, and to make our dances enjoyable and memorable are
all activities that also promote Square Dancing for all.  They have been quietly and steadfastly doing all of this for
40 years for Willamette Squares and other clubs, such as Maplewood Squares (founding members) and Capital Eights.

<h3>
Steve & Valerie Murphy<br>
Charlie Browns<br>
Rogue-Sis-Q Council</h3>

<p>
Steve & Valerie began their dancing career in 1970 when they joined
the Spindrifters Square Dance Club and the Salinas Lariat Swingers Folk
Dance Club, both in Salinas, CA.  The Lariat Swingers was an exhibition
club that did International Folk Dancing all over CA.  The Murphys
were the babies of the club since they were the only dancers under 50.
From there they took a break until 2005 when they returned to square and
round dancing in Oregon.  While members of the Klamath Country Squares
they held offices of President (Steve) and Secretary (Valerie).  Also,
Valerie was President of the Interstate Highlanders Council and Steve was
delegate to the Federation for four years.  In 2009 they were appointed
Goodwill Ambassadors by the outgoing Federation President.  Although they
served out their 5 year term in 2014 they still promote square and round
dancing by attending an average of 1-2 festivals per month.

The Murphys are members of the Rogue Squares in Medford and The Charlie
Browns in Grants Pass.  They have taught ballroom dancing through
the Klamath Community College system and Steve cues and choreographs
round dances.  They spend their winters in Mesa, AZ which is the Round
Dance capital of the world.

Indianapolis, IN; Alexandria, VA; Los Angeles, CA; Mon, Belgium; Ypsilanti, MI; Washington, DC; and Heidelberg, Germany.
Dancing opportunities were few and far between, consequently they forgot most of the moves until retirement in 1992.

time, Dale has been president 6 years and is currently serving his 7th term as secretary.  For the Sunset Area, he served
as club delegate for 2 years and Recording Secretary for 2 years.  At the state level, Dale served as Sunset Area Council
delegate for 3 years, was elected 2nd Vice President, 1st Vice President, before moving to the President's chair last
September.

<p>
Kathy is currently serving as Hayshakers club president, an office she has held for a total of 10 years.  She has also
served as vice president and member-at-large.  She sserved as president of the council for 3 years, treasurer for 5 years,
and club delegate for 4 years.  She is currently the club delegate to the TVC.  At the state level, Kathy served as
Sunset Area delegate for 3 years, and is the current TVC delegate.  They served as Oregon's delegates to USDA for 7 years.

<p>
In 2004, the Hayshakers put on the Oregon Summer Festival.  In 2005, they chaired the Lewis & Clark Caravan Encampment
in Astoria before the 54th National Square Dance Convention.  They served on the Vendor Hospitality Committee at the
2012 National Convention.  They have co-chaired the Seaside Sashay for 15 years.  In January 2015, they received the
TVC Outstanding Recognition Award.  They advertise and recruit new dancers and have been involved in parades and
dancing.  They set up and run many dances for holidays and annual club picnics.  Visiting clubs appreciate them setting
up beach dances when they visit.
