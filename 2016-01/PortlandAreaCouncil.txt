In our continuing quest of how we may help our domain clubs, it puzzles us on why clubs comment upon low attendance, when 41%  of our clubs dance on the same night, competing with each other.  This may have been well and good when there were hundreds of dancers across the Portland area.  But with thinning populations, this is getting to be more of a problem.

	On the other hand, the clubs that don’t dance first and third Saturdays sincerely hope those other clubs don’t switch dance nights, as they would compete with their own clubs.  A lot of problems don’t really have an answer, and this may be one of them.

	The trick of remaining a viable club may well be in the use of innovation.  Just because a club has “always done it this way” doesn’t mean that it’s a good business model.  And as previously mentioned in this column, dance clubs are a business, and ultimately have to use a business model.
