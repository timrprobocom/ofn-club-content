The Tri-Squares spent the month of December with two dances! On the 5th we had a B-51 dance where new students were able to join. Thank you to all of the clubs who brought their students. Our annual dinner gathering was a great success. Club members exchanged gifts, ate delicious Chinese food and enjoyed each others fellowship.

We will be hosting our second set of lessons this January. We look forward to seeing many students and guests.
