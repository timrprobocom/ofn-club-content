As I sit down to write this update, Portland just experienced its rainiest 24-hour period ever in December. Maybe, just for the Northwest, we should change ‚Äúload the boat‚Äù to ‚Äúbuild the ark‚Äù?
 
The Ramblers tried a seasonal theme‚Ä&rdquo;Snowflakes and Rainbows‚Ä&rdquo;for our December 5 dance, but Wind Gusts and Raindrops would have been closer to the mark. No matter‚Ä&rdquo;we had a fabulous time dancing to Anne Uebelacker from British Columbia. It sure helps to know your fractions when you dance with Anne. And I think I was right about ¬Ω the time!
 
Our annual Black and White Dance celebrates the new year and is one of the highlights of the Ramblers‚Äô dance calendar. This year‚Äôs dance will take place on Saturday, January 2, at the Milwaukie Grange. We will have a potluck from 6-7 and then alternate Mainstream and Plus tips from 7-9:30. (No rounds.) Our caller is the incomparable Stephen Cole. Solos and couples are welcome!
 
The Ramblers will begin our next series of Mainstream lessons in January. We will start with two free introductory lessons on January 6 and 13. Formal instruction will start on January 20. Lessons are given on Wednesday nights, from 7-9 pm, at the Ankeny Street Studio, 975 SE Sandy Blvd., Portland.
 
SYIAS!
