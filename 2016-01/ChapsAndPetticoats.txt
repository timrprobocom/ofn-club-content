Oh what a difference a JAMBOREE makes!!  IF you missed our New Dancer Dance on  November 22, 2015 ‚Ä&ldquo; you missed an memorable event with 100+ people in attendance.   
We exceeded the capacity of our Grange and were honored with so many students, Angels, families and Callers in attendance.  Our Club Caller, Scott Zinser, and Cuer, Jackie Gale, were ‚Äúsparked‚Äù and beaming with such a crowd.   Guest Callers:  Terry Halley and Tim Kane added to the ambiance as they called with 9-10 squares on the floor.  At the after break, we served a Thanksgiving feast with two twenty-pound turkeys, a nine-pound ham and all the trimmings - eat to the bone.  Thank you to all the Clubs that responded to our invitations...you created a not-to-be-forgotten event!

The Chaps & Petticoats (C&P) new-dancers and Angels had a great time at the Tri-Squares B-51dance on December 5, 2015, with Terry Halley calling and Sandra Pinion cueing at the Tigard Grange.   The Club President, Gloria Davis, was so thrilled with the attendance, that C&P and Hoedowners were awarded Tri-squares banners.  The food was delightful and the entertainment livey...thank you Tri-squares.

Please be aware that Chaps and Petticoats will be DARK on New Years Day, Friday, January 1st, 2016.    We would love to have you join us on Friday, January 15, 2016 ‚Ä&ldquo; help us bring in the New Year with Darrell Kalmback calling and Julie Stiers cueing.

We hope you make a joyous-noise to bring in the New Year!

Happy Feet ÔÅä
