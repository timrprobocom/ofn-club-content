Our hall, Milwaukie Community Center on 42nd & Jackson, 10666 SE 42nd, 97222, is finally climbing out of it's financial hole.  The decision last year to reroof was a tough cookie to swallow, but 2016 is looking to bring us stability.  These old buildings are treasures.  We must not let them disintegrate, and everyone knows you have to start at the roof, if it is going bad.  Our thanks to Carey and Yvonne Price for their years of dedication as the President couple of what we so fondly call "MCC".  Ron and Barbara Whitworth have now accepted that responsibility.

We had a fine celebration of Veterans Day at our first November dance, made all the more special by Reni Reed and her "Quilts of Valor" organization.   The quilts are beautiful and each is unique.  Thank you, wonderful people, for this tribute.

December activities started with a Holiday Dinner at Elmers Restaurant in northeast Portland.  A gift exchange was enjoyed by those who wished to participate.  Our two club dances were festive with lots of holiday spirit.  

New Years Eve was celebrated at our hall with a Last Hoedown.  Our caller, Les Seeley, and guest cuer, Patty Hermann provided a great evening of dancing and fun.

Our 16 new dancers will graduate soon and we encourage them to join us at Mid Winter Festival.

See you there!
