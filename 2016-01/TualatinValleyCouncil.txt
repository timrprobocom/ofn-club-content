You may be reading this in late December so I will remind you of our New Year’s Eve dance on December 31st, held at the IOOF Hall, 267 East Main Street, Hillsboro, OR 97123.  Doug Davis is the featured caller with Randy Lewis cueing.  This is a ticket sale dance.  They can be purchased in advance through TVC officers, or club delegates at each of the TVC clubs.  Ticket sales are going well so you need to get yours soon.  The evening will begin with a lasagna dinner at 7:30 with dancing from 8:30PM until about 12:15AM.  Every 3rd tip will be Plus followed by intermediate rounds.  One tip will be called after midnight.
