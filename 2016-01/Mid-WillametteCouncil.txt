The first New Dancerâ€™s Dance for the Mid-Willamette Area was an extreme success on Nov. 29. Hosted by the Timber Twirlers, 13 squares were crammed on the dance floor at the Eagles Lodge in Albany. What a great way it was to start off the New Dancer Dances! Thank you to all the new dancers and angels for your support.
