We are finished with Waltz review and will workshop specific songs in all rhythms for December and possibly January.

There are several people signed up to do a Showcase at Mid-Winter so we will be getting in practice for the next couple of months and getting our clothing/costumes figured out by then also.

A membership meeting (without the president due to illness) was held and we will be making plans for the new year right after Thanksgiving, such as types of rhythms to review, when to have lessons and whether we want to change our times of dancing and having lessons. There is plenty to discuss amongst us all, as we are working to make our club better and bigger.

We are dark on Christmas Eve, but will be dancing at 8:30 p.m. on New Yearâ€™s Eve. Our flyer was in the December issue, so go back and find it and join us for a nice evening of dancing and visiting with friends. We hope your 2016 is bountiful with friends and good health. Happy dancing anywhere you may go
