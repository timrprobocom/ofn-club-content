Happy New Year! We welcome in January of 2016 by offering mainstream lessons starting January 14, 2016. Scott Zinser is our able teacher/caller and lesson will be free for the first night to encourage all who want to try it. We meet every Thursday from 7:30 until 9:30 at the Boring Barn.

Our club has started a new fundraiser, by serving at the Gresham Burgerville on certain Wednesday evenings. Club member serve food and keep the dining room clean, and get to keep a percentage of the profits for that period. Come out and eat your supper there on our nights to help the club.

Many dancers will be heading to Albany for the Mid-Winter Festival to break up the winter doldrums. We eat out together as a club on Saturday night, then go dance off some of the calories. This is always a fun time!
