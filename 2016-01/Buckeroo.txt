November was busy with lots going on at the Barn. Our first dance on November 7th was an apple themed dance. We had fall decorations and lots of yummy apple treats. Everyone who came had a great time. Dale Roberson called the squares and Neil Koozer cued the rounds.

November 21st we had our annual Thanksgiving potluck dance. The Barn provided the turkey and the dancers all brought something to share. After the potluck, we had an hour of student level dancing for our current students. It was so much fun seeing them out on the dance floor having a great time. The dance was called by Chuck Simpkins and cued by Neil Koozer.

We have also had work crews at barn preparing all the wreaths for our annual fundraiser. The volunteers worked hard to get everything perfect! The wreaths are ready and look beautiful. Check out our website for details if you are in the area and want to pick up a beautiful hand-crafted wreath for the holidays.

Happy dancing,
