This reporter has not been "in the groove" with the new mode for the OFN, but the
Lebanon club has truly been busy --- dancing and having fun. On December 5, we had
our New Dancers Dance & Toy Dance with over six squares on the floor. Our local Fire Department firefighters came during the dance and picked up several big bags of toys. Thanks to all our dancers.

Now to catch you all up on some past activities, October was highlighted by our Black Light Dance with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing. In November the Lebanon Square Circlers helped the Sweet Home Squarenaders celebrate their Turkey Dinner Dance. On November 21, we hosted the Girls Night Out for our dance. We really had a glorious time with Sandy, Charlotte, and Jackie. Dancing was great!

The weekend after Thanksgiving, club members gathered at Ralston Park in Lebanon to assemble a display for the community Holiday In The Park. Then on the following Saturday, there was a lighting ceremony. Our club received first place for "Best of
Theme" for the displays in the park.

We are looking forward to a raid and our Christmas dance. Then on Sunday, January
17, we will be celebrating our 67th Birthday Dance. Charlotte Jeskey will be calling and Jackie Gale cueing with guest caller Jim Voll. Strawberry shortcake will be served during break. Hope to see you all there. See you in a square!
