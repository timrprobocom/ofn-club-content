Willamette Squares has been busy with both round and square dance lessons. We have a good group of new dancers who are coming along nicely. They will get another chance to strut their stuff during the first week of January when Willamette Squares hosts a new dancer dance at the Salem Square Dance Center.

We held our traditional Thanksgiving dance the fourth Saturday in November. It was well attended and included a fabulous feast with turkey and ham and all the trimmings. Our special thanks to Nancy Baker for her supervision and contributions to our dinner and to Brice Baker for hauling all the dishes and ingredients. Thanks to everyone who brought side dishes and helped with setting up, decorations, and clean up. When everyone pitches in, a lot can be accomplished in a shorter time. We have so much for which to be thankful.

Willamette Squares will be dark for the month of December. We hope to see you all in the new year.
