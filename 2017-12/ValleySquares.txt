Founded in 1867, the National Grange is 150 years old, and to celebrate we are having a FREE dance December 2nd!  Craig Abercrombie will be calling and Connie Clark is cueing.  Then on the 14th, Mark Wheeler will be calling our Santa Dance & Connie is cueing.
 We started the month of October by going dark to attend Sunset Promenaders' Anniversary Dance.  The dinner was tasty, the callers and cuers delightful, and there was a large number of guests.  There were many dancers from their sister club in Japan who gave gifts to those in attendance.
 Our Halloween Costume Dance provided an opportunity for folks to don alter-egos along with their costumes.
 We won the trophy for having the highest percentage of members attending the Tualatin Timber Squares Trophy Dance, and will be hosting the Trophy Dance on the evening of the Free dance Grange celebration on December 2nd.
 Happy Holidays!
