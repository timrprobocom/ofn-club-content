The Wave Steppers will be dark over the winter.  Our next dance will be the second Saturday in March 2018.  It will be our St. Patrick’s Dance, with caller Joe Wrabek and line dance instructor Gwen Kiel.
 The Wednesday night square dance classes are taking a hiatus in December.  There will be no classes between Thanksgiving and New Year’s because too many people will be out of town for the holidays.
 The club will be having a Christmas party on Wednesday, December 20th, at the Community Center in Rockaway Beach starting at 2 p.m.  We did this last year and it was a lot of fun.  This time around we’ll have dancing too with Joe and Gwen.
