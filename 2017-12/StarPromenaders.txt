Does every year go by as quickly as this one?  I sure hope the rest of mine go by much less quickly.
So here's to a great 2018..................

The Thanksgiving Dinner was very enjoyable and sure hope the Christmas Dinner is as good and is as well attended. Bring something good to eat and enjoy the dinner and class on December 21.

And of course New Year's Eve will be celebrated as usual with our New Year's Eve Dance and meal.

Dress up and come celebrate the New Year with us.  Wayne Weaver will be calling and Bob Dingman will be cuing.  Midnight will be celebrated in co-ordination with New York's Time Square.  See you there!

Also in December will be a Midwinter Dance by the callers and cuers. See the flier for all the details.

Our Birthday Dance will be in February as usual.  The caller will be Lawrence Johnstone and the cuing will be provided by Rikki Lobato.

Many of you probably have heard that Wayne Weaver is retiring. Well, it's true.  There is to be a retirement party August 11.  More information as it occurs. He will surely be missed.

Come to a class or a dance and join us in a good evening's fun

See you next year............
