Had a good time at our Thanksgiving Dance with Mary & Dean

Our new dancers are having a great time and looking forward to Midway Dance.

Our next dance is our Christmas dance on Saturday , December 16th with Mary Nutt cueing the rounds at 7 and Dean with the squares starting at 8.

We are looking forward to the Charlie's B-day dance as well as the many dances in the next couple of weeks to close out 2017.

Would like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and best of the new year.

See you on the dance floor.
