The club continues on with intermediate waltz lessons. Each week is a review of the week before and more steps in variations added. Then more music is added to work on practicing the new steps. The class is a good one and we will continue until about Mid-Winter before switching rhythms. 
We are dancing on New Yearâ€™s Eve with Cheryl Manley and Ken Pratt sharing the cueing duties so both can dance during the evening. For $8, you can dance, eat, share friendship with others, and just sit and relax and dance a favorite song.
We are not dancing on Thanksgiving for those of you who read the OFN right after it comes out. There are many dances over the weekend to dance off the food you ate on that Thursday. Enjoy the time with family, both personal and square dance. The holidays are a good time to get the Christmas attire out of the closet, make sure it is clean, and then show the world how wonderful you look and share the specialness of the season. Merry Christmas to all our friends on and off the dance floor, Marilyn Schmit
