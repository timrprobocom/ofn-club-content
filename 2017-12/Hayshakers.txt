We had a successful 17th year Seaside Sashay on October 27th and 28th.  I want to thank all of you that came to dance and have fun.  I would also like to thank everyone who helped behind the scenes to make it successful.  The weather could not have been nicer.  The dances outside were warm and sunny.  It was great.
