We had a festive and well-attended Halloween Dance on October 28. Thanks to all who came out for a fun evening.

Our mainstream lessons have combined with the Albany Timber Twirlers', and our students are continuing to learn under Bruce and Judy's excellent guidance. We look forward to the start of the Area New Dancers' Dances.

We were dark in November in order to be able to attend other dances, so are excited about December when we're holding our Christmas Dance. We're looking forward to dancing in the New Year! Wishing Happy Holidays to all! Karen
