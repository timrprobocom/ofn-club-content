Come join us for our Ugly Christmas Sweater Dance on December 13th.  We will be having our BIG drawing for a MidWinter Ribbon.  Must be present to win.  Each paid dancer gets a ticket into the drawing.  Prizes for the ugliest sweaters as well!
 Lessons start the first Wednesday of January.  We will not be having free lessons.  The first Wednesday of each month we are going to have a live band.  No square dancing experience necessary.  All dancers must pay on live band nights.  The remaining Wednesdays of the month will be dedicated to progressive square dance lessons.  Lessons are $7 a class or 10 lessons for $50.
