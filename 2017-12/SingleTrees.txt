Our Oct. 13th dance with Jim Hattrick and Jackie Gale was well attended.Seeing all the round dancers on the floor reminded me of when Pat Hintz was our cuer and dancers filled the floor. Jackie is doing a great job as well. We always enjoy Jim’s calling and are so fortunate to have him come down all the way from Vancouver WA. Jim, you make people happy to be dancing and we love all your jokes and stories too.

Our Halloween Bash on Friday, Oct. 27th had a number of zany costumes, ranging from a weirwolf to a leopardess. Our treasurer, Joy Pitts, always comes up with fun and often quite crazy ideas. She did a great job of decorating the hall with some very unusual witches and Halloween decor.   Prizes were awarded to the top contenders—Joy Pitts, Paul McAnelly, and both Vonda Clayton and Lori Stern (who tied for third place).  K.C. Curtis drove all the way down from Seaside to call for us that evening. What a wonderful repertoire of songs he had on hand. He introduced a new one sung by Tom Jones originally—super, super special. Jackie once more had a crowded round dance floor.

We are looking forward to our Christmas dinner and dance on Dec. 8th with Jim Hattrick calling and Jackie Gale cueing. If you are in town be sure to come join us at 6:30 pm for the potluck dinner (and bring something to nosh on) and 7:30 pm for the dance.  This will be the only Single Trees dance in December as we are dark for Christmas weekend.
