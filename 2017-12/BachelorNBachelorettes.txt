December will be full of special dances for us; every week will be themed.  Dec. 6 will be our pajama dance.  (I’ll still find a way to flounce my ruffles.).  Dec 13, our famous Basket Raffle.  Our Christmas Dance on Dec 20, and our Pre-Pre-Pre-Pre New Year’s Eve dance to get you warmed up for the new year.  (Of course some will be warmed up when they see me at the Pajama Dance.)  Be kind to us ladies; our bouncers Bruce Bruiser and Strong-Arms Armstrong will be on duty.

A special note for Dec 13.  Besides being our Basket Raffle Dance, this will also be our New Dancer Jamboree.  This is a big to-do because all the other clubs have their jamborees on Sundays, for whatever reason.  This is a nice alternative for a Wednesday evening.  At a minimum, the dance will be a B-51, and maybe higher.  Jim Hattrick calling and cueing.

Why not give yourself a treat and join the B&B’s?  For only $12, and the price of a badge, you will get a year and three month’s membership and several free dances a year.  – A great bargain!  Ask for the membership applications at the front desk.
