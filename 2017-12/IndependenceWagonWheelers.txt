The IWW Mainstream students are doing great at our Sunday afternoon lessons, with a committed group of angels sharing in the fun (Many thanks, angels!). Following mainstream lessons, a small but enthusiastic group is brushing up on Plus dancing and working toward DBD expertise. 

Our dances continue to be well attended and loads of fun. Our November 4 dance was a high point of the year so far, with 44 visitors! (It was wonderful to have the visitors with their enthusiasm and spirit. Y’all come back real soon, y’hear!)  Later in the month, we honored all veterans with our Veterans’ Day dance. 

Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays at the Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall, and be sure to put our December 9 Rocky Mountain Christmas special dance on your calendar. See the Flyer on the OFN web site. Have a wonderful holiday season. Dee and Bert Mackaman
