Despite the wet weather we had another good dance at our new hall, the Palmer Creek Lodge. 

The Holiday season is upon us and we look forward to celebrating with family and friends but also want to share with those who are less fortunate. Our November Dance benefited St. Barnabus' Soup Kitchen in McMinnville. Itâ€™s also time to be thankful for all our blessings. Square dancing and the great friends we have because of it are at the top of our list for sure.  Stay safe out there as the weather changes. Carmen
