The holidays are under way and we are participating fully.  I wanted to share how you helped us reach a goal for the Pink Dance donations.  We have collected more than last year.  Yea for the square dance community for coming together for cancer research.  $1749 for 2017 Dance for the Cure.  We also worked hard as a club to help the Kinton Grange with their Fall Dinner Festival.  I have never seen so many pieces of delicious pie pass through my hands with only eating just one piece.
 November started out with our Boot Scootin Boogie Dance wearing our best western attire.  Fun evening.  It’s being followed with our Thankful Dance on the 17th.  Hope to remind everyone that in November and December we are collecting canned food for our food drive to help folks in need this winter.  November 26th the Toes are gathering at the grange to help decorate the hall for Christmas, then head out to eat together at a favorite restaurant.
 Let’s see December 1st is our We Wreath You a Merry Christmas Dance, following up with a fun New Dancer’s Jamboree on December 3rd.  Come join us with your new students.  December 15th is our holiday Blessing Dance, then just the Toes will gather on December 28th for a game night and pot luck at the grange.  Our Round Dance lessons begin January 7th, with Bev and Harlan Flint on Sundays from 2 to 4 p.m.  They will be teaching 2 Step and Waltz.  Check our club flyers and website for full information.  
 Looking forward to seeing you in the New Year on Jan. 5th and the 19th for our regular dances.  See you in a square.
