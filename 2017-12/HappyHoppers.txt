Although the Happy Hoppers were dark for our first dance in November, we’re really looking forward to our November 18th dance, our “Pies and Presents” dance.   In addition to the scrumptious pies we’ll be enjoying at our break, we will be collecting toys and gifts appropriate for children who are served by The Children’s Center, a nonprofit organization which provides mental health services for children in need.  We will also collect gifts at our December 2nd dance.  The Center has always truly appreciated the tremendous generosity of our members and guests.

	Plans are under way for our New Year’s Eve dance.  It’s one of the two really special dances we do each year, and this year will be no exception.  The theme is “Come Sail Away.”  Once again we will be featuring the Front Porch Trio:  Jim Hattrick, Craig Abercrombie, and Adam Christman.  The decorations and the food are always outstanding, so check out our flyers and get ready to purchase your tickets for an event you won’t want to miss.

	Speaking of special events, we want to share what a great time our Hoppers had at a couple of local events in October.  At the R Square D’s October Fest not only were the squares and rounds a lot of fun, but the Saturday night German dinner was outstanding.  What a terrific job their club did!   Another special weekend attended by 25 of our members was the Seaside Sashay.  The weather was perfect for dancing at the Turnaround.  The callers and cuer made the day and evening dances energizing, sometimes challenging, and just plain fun!  The Hayshakers and Sunset Promenaders deserve a big “Thank you,” for all the work they did to provide a wonderful weekend for dancers.
