At the time of this writing the November events have not yet happened but ther is excitement in the air here in River City as we look forward to them.

On November 3 and 4 we have our beach trip to Landmark Inn in Lincoln City . We will have water aerobics in the pool, eat, play games and even have a square dance in the parking lot.

Saturday November 11 begins with our club meeting before the dance.At that meeting we will vote on our new club caller.  Sorry but I have no idea who that will be .I enjoyed and was favorably impressed by each candidate who applied , so I feel confident that we will end up with a good one. After the meeting that evening we  will have  Veterand day dance. We will be honoring our veterans. In the past , Reni  has  made quilts for each of our veterans . They are called “quilts of valor. “ Those who have received them will bring them for display .
