Thank you to everyone who attended our Ham Dinner Dance in November. We all had a great time dancing to Leonard and Frances. We all stuffed ourselves with a great dinner! 
We have a regular dance for our December dance and our new dancer's dance is coming in January. See you at a dance soon! Petrina Bucheit
