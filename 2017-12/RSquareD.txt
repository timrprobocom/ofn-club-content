Another successful Octoberfest!!  We had 10 plus squares in attendance  Saturday night.  The work that the club did to improve the acoustics worked even better than anticipated.  Saturday morning garage saleing was, as always, a big success for the out of towners, (home towners too).  Thank you to Lynn Waliezer and everyone who helped make this dance a success.  We are already working to make Octoberfest 2018 even bigger and better.
 On October 28th we had our annual Halloween Dance.  Cougars and R Square D made up the 2+ squares attending.
 R Square D started lessons on the 18th.  All is going well.  We have some new faces, and some who have tried dancing before have come back, as always we need angels.
 December dances will be Friday December 8th, that will be our annual Toy Dance.  Members will bring a toy to be donated to the Salvation Army toy drive.  We will be dark on the 23rd.  MERRY CHRISTMAS everyone. 
 For more information about us please visit our website at www.r-square-d.info or friend us on Facebook.  Our caller for R Square D is Craig Abercrombie and our cuer is Lonnie Sycks.
