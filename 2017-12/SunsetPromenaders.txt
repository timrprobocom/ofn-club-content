We had a great Sunset Promenaders 32nd Anniversary Dance with over 100 dancers, a full dance floor.  We had a wonderful ham dinner before the dance, and then open desserts during the dance.  The dance featured Mike Stout and Darrell Kalmbach calling with Ken Pratt and Julie Stout cueing.  It was great dance, thank you to all of the visitors, we appreciate you coming out and helping us celebrate.  It was great to visit with all our friends we donâ€™t get to see often enough and great to have a full dance floor, too.
 The Seaside Sashay was a lot of fun this year with fantastic weather; sun and no wind.  We had Darrell Kalmbach and Dan Preedy calling and Debbie Taylor cueing.  This crew did an outstanding job of entertaining and exercising us.  Cynthia Weber did a great job on the decorating of the Convention Center.  On Saturday morning we danced at the Turnaround and that is special especially when the weather is so great.  We are looking forward to going again next year.  Of course we had the mud wrestling completion at 5:30 on Saturday morning; that is a long tradition of the Sashay.  If you missed this Sashay, be sure to look for and come to it next year; it will be on October 26th and 27th in 2018.
 December 2nd and 16th we are having Christmas theme Mainstream Dances with Mike Stout calling and Ken Pratt cueing at our Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall.
 Also, we are having a food drive the months of November and December; we collect the food and give it to the Food Bank for our less fortunate neighbors.  What we collect is non-perishable food with good protein such as canned food, beans, rice, nuts, etc.
 The Plus Promenaders dances are on Thursdays the 7th and 21st in December with Darrell Kalmbach calling and Ken Pratt Cueing.  Please check out our new website at www.sunsetpromenaders.com
