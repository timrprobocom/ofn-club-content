Happy Holidays Everyone! 

Come join the Oaky Doaks as we celebrate this festive season. December looks to be a very busy month for the Oaky Doaks.

On Saturday, December 2nd, we will be having our “Christmas Whimsy Dance”! Everyone is asked to bring their favorite Christmas Cooke to share at our break. Caller Janienne Alexander and Cuer Molly Combs will be doing semi gospel as they only can. Pre-Rounds start at 7:00. Mainstream with Rounds will start at 7:30. Break and the sharing of the cookies will start at 9:30.

On Sunday, December 10th, we will be gathering together for the annual Oaky Doaks Christmas Party and Potluck. After all the dinning is done there will be the entertainment of the gift exchange for those who wish to participate. But of course, the best things from the event are the time spent with one another and holiday spirit that is shared amongst us.

We wrap up December with our fourth Saturday dance on December 16th with our “Christmas Traditions Dance”. Come share your traditions with us as we gather to Caller Janienne Alexander and Cuer Molly Combs in Christmas carols.
Rudolph sent me an email saying that if everyone who attends the dance is on the good list that Santa may come and visit for a square or two.  Pre-Rounds start at 7:00. Mainstream with Rounds will start at 7:30. Break and the sharing of the cookies will start at 9:30.

From the Oaky Doaks to all. May this Holiday Season mark another period of joy, peace and love in your life. May your lives be filled with more victories and blessings. May you have a Merry Christmas with a Happy and Safe New Year.
See you on the dance floor!
