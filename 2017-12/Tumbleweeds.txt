Our mainstream class is going great!   Many are looking forward to jamborees and mid winter festival.  If we have another bad winter like last year, you can call Nunnally Johnson (503 659 2270) to see if our dance has been cancelled because of weather.  We even started a list of phone numbers of our regular visitors when we had to cancel because of snow and ice.
