Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas seem to pile on top of one another especially when shopping.  I have to check my calendar to make sure of the date.  I had some imaginative costumed children at my door this year and I hope you did too. 
 Give yourself a pat on the back if you made the effort to vote.  We are so lucky to have a mail in ballot so we have time to consider how to vote and do not have to stand in line.
 Remember to give some thanks to the people who manage our clubs, our fantastic callers and cuers, and the friends who make dancing so much fun that you do not even realize you are exercising.
 The new location for our beach trip, Seaside, was a good choice for our group as there are many activities besides walking on the sand.  Naturally, we had plenty of food, games, and talk so we had a good time. About twenty eight members attended.  The weather was wonderful, sunny and warm.
 Twenty one members celebrated the Sunset Promenaderâ€™s anniversary dance.  We have been trying to attend as many anniversary dances as we can because it is important to support the clubs. 
 We had a good turnout of members at Seaside Sashay.  Everyone had a good time.  Again the weather did not disappoint.  Dancing on the turnaround was especially nice this year being sunny and warm.  The callers were great and included our own Darrell Kalmbach.  Wonderful weekend. 
 After a very successful Plus Class earlier this year we are repeating our program starting at noon, February 5th, Monday, running into May. If you are thinking about learning or brushing up on Plus be ready to join us.  We will have the same three great callers giving the lessons: Daryl Clendenin, Jim Hattrick, and Darrell Kalmbach.
