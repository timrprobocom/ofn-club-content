In October the Lebanon Square Circlers had two great dances, including the Black Light dance. Our caller was Charlotte Jeskey and our cuer was Jackie Gale. We also helped Corvallis Squares celebrate Halloween.   

On November 4, the Lebanon club traveled to the Independence Wagon Wheelers and we had a great time.  On the November 11, we plan to celebrate with the Sweet Home Squarenaders and enjoy the Turkey Dinner Dance with Jim Hattrick calling and Jackie Gale cueing. Then we have a regular dance on November 18.  

The first Saturday in December will be our New Dancers Dance and our Toy Dance. If you bring an unwrapped toy, you can get into the dance for $3.00. The toys go to our local fire department for the annual Christmas toy drive. 
 
Our lessons are going great each Sunday evening. See you in a square! Marilyn York
