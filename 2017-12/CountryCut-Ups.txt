There is a chill in the air and shorter days that tell us Christmas is just around the corner! We start out December with our first Saturday dance on the 2nd with Darrell Kalmbach and Julie Stiers at 7:00 PM. On December 3rd, we will be having a new student Jamboree at the Boring Barn from 1:30 to 4:00 PM with Scott Zinser calling. The Cut-Ups will have their annual Christmas Party and gift exchange on December 9th for the club members and current mainstream students. We have a great class going fall.

Our 4th Saturday dance will be a Pre-Christmas Eve dance on December 23rd, so get your shopping done early, so you can join us! Our 5th Saturday dance will be a Pre-New Year's Eve event with Jim Hattrick calling and cueing. If you don't like to be out on New Year's Eve, then join us the night before and celebrate early! Or go to two parties, back to back and dance the new year in! We will be dark on New Year's Eve this year, but there are plenty of good dances around.

Consider joining the Country Cut-Ups in 2018. The dues are $60 per person and that gets you into two dances per month. Such a deal! It lets you dance at about half the regular price. Membership is up, so door and kitchen duty is reasonable. We are the most fun club around these parts, of course, I may be biased! But after all, we are the Cut-Ups!
