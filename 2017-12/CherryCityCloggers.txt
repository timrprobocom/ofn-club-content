With our Demo season behind us, the Cherry City Cloggers don't have a lot a anything really outstanding to report.

We are continuing to bring along a small beginner class which will be graduating the week after Christmas. Halloween just happened to fall on our dance night this year, so several club members came in costume, which is always fun. We are looking forward to Mid-Winter and being able to dance with National Cuers Russ and Leila Hunsaker.  

We will probably have our semi-annual meeting sometime in January with the election and appointment of officers. Until then, we wish you all a very blessed and happy holiday season. Georganne Pfnister
