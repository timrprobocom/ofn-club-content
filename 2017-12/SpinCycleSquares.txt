By the time you read this, our special dance with Kris Jensen will be history.  Boy, oh, boy what an event. Dancing, potluck and silent auction. We always enjoy having Kris in Eugene to call for us. Our regular caller, Tim Matteson, has a chance to dance too. The last time Kris was in Eugene she called a demo dance at Sheldon Oaks where her and Kurt's mom resides. One of the residents came back to dancing after a several year hiatus. I think it's kind of like riding a bicycle. It comes back to you how to do it. We are happy to have Beverly back to dancing and dancing with us. We dance almost every Sunday evening from 5:30 - 8:00  Double check the When and Where in the OFN.  

Kirby Goode misses coming to our dances. We miss him too. Kirby remains on 'in home' hospice care. 

Happy dancing,

Christina Corelli, Member-At-Large
