The Charlie's enjoyed a wonderful dance with Scot & Erin Byars on October 21st. This was their first time at the Charlie's - and everyone had a blast. We even did a petti-pant dance, since Scot's chicken has gone missing...
The first dance in Nov was a small but happy crowd, and everyone enjoyed the talents of Phil-Billy & Elaine.
Our 3rd Sat dance in November, on the 18th, is a "traveling" dance and the Charlie's are heading up to Roseburg to enjoy dancing to Mike Sikorsky.  We had a  wonderful Advanced Workshop with Richard Lane on Nov 16th. I know there are Charlie's planning to attend his dance at the Rogues on the 17th, he is a great caller. 
Classes are going well with about 9 students, followed by a fun Mainstream Workshop. We are weaving our way thru the Advanced DVDs and the small class is really enjoying themselves on Thursdays. We appreciate the more experienced Advanced dancers who have graciously agreed to fill in the squares as needed!!!
December is an exciting month!!! Saturday December 2nd, we celebrate our 50th birthday!!! The wonderfully talented Charlie Robertson from LA area will be calling the dance & Steve Murphy will be cueing. Advanced starts at 600; pre-rounds at 730 and MS/Plus from 8-1030. There will probably be a post dance thrown in as well as some cake. We will also have door prizes & raffle items. You don't want to miss this wonderful celebration. 
The 3rd Saturday December 16, is our Chocolate Christmas Affair with Chuck Simpkins & Bob Dingman calling & cueing. Should be a real treat and I am sure there will be lots of chocolate!
We are looking forward to many events coming up at the Charlie's as well as other clubs in the area.
Hope to see you in a square.
Safe travels & happiest of holidays to you & your families!!
