<p>&nbsp;For our new dancers who started lessons in September, December opens the doors to many new and exciting dancing opportunities in the form of jamborees or new dancer dances. If your club has a class that started in September, now is a good time to suggest that your students register for the OFN. Encourage your students to attend not only your own jamboree, but other clubs&rsquo; jamborees. If your students are nervous about attending other jamborees, angels might offer to attend the jamborees with their students or pick their students up and drive them to the jamborees. Consider meeting for lunch or dinner before the jamboree and go as a group. Not only does this build a positive relationship within your club, but it helps to alleviate any fears your students may have. <br /><br />If you are a new dancer, this paragraph is for you&nbsp; If you are ready to try attending a jamboree on your own, look at the flyers in this month&rsquo;s OFN. There are jamborees throughout the state almost every weekend this month. Talk to your caller/teacher to find out what level you are currently dancing at. There are 68 moves in the Mainstream Program, and your level is determined by how many moves you know. If you see a flyer with a B51 level, that means the dance will be called at Basic Level 51 which includes the first 51 moves in the Mainstream Program. When looking for a jamboree to attend, be sure you can dance up to the level being called. If you are currently dancing at a lower level, please look for a different jamboree. If in doubt, remember to ask your caller/teacher. Be brave and visit other clubs&rsquo;s jamborees. The other dancers are not strangers, they are just new friends waiting to greet you and dance with you.<br /><br />Hope your holidays are safe and happy. <br />Merry Christmas <br />Kathy Roberts <br />OFSRDC President</p>
