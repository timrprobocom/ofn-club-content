In October four of our 14 students who had some previous experience decided to go ahead and join our club, and they’ve continued on at lessons to keep brushing up, too. The great support from our angels has gone a long way towards increasing membership like this.
 November 4th we planned a dance-demo at the Tigard Grange to help celebrate the Oregon Grange’s 150th anniversary, with help from caller K.C. Curtis and some members of the Toe Draggers Club.
 On November 12th we had our new dancers jamboree, and then we took our students to Chaps & Petticoats jamboree on the 19th.  We’ve been doing this happy “student-exchange” the last few years with great success.
 On November 25th we were dark, due to two big area dances with national callers on that same day. Just too tempting to go see them!
 December 3rd we’ll have our club’s annual holiday dinner, this time at Yen’s Chinese Restaurant in Tigard, in a nice side room with no extra charge.  And it’s always fun to do the crazy white elephant gift exchange, with some particularly goofy gifts showing up again and again, year after year.
 We’d especially like to express our thanks to Signscope Signs in Tigard (11940 SW Pacific Hwy, Suite E) because every year Signscope does a terrific job with helping us advertise our lessons by updating the huge banner on the outside of the grange.  They always provide great service, and they are greatly appreciated.
