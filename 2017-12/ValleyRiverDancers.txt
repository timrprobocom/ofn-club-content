Our BLack Light dance was a lot of fun the end of October. We have been busy doing some visiting to other clubs and really enjoying dancing with our friends. 
I hope you can make it to our Gospel Dance on Friday, November 24.  Randy & Julie always do a great job.  Also, our New Dancer's Dance is the 22nd of December with a $5 gift exchange. We hope to see you in a square soon. Jan Amerson
