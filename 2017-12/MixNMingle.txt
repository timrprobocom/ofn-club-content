It was a dark and stormy night outside.  Inside Winona Grange things couldn't have been brighter for our 33rd Birthday Dance celebration, which was quite a success, complete with visitations, Randy's calling, Dennis's cuing, and chocolate cake with ice cream.  Of course, Lindie had her usual "Guess how many M&Ms are in a jar" contest.  While Randy came closest on all three guesses, he was allowed only one prize.  
 Randy called mainstream to welcome all who came.  He makes mainstream so much fun that you don't notice what level it is.  People who had just finished their mainstream classes danced every tip with smiles on their faces.
 We saw regulars, people that we hadn't seen for a long time, TVC officers, and some dancers we hadn't met before.  We welcomed them all, including visitations from the Country Cut-Ups (Tualatin is a long way from the Boring Barn) and Toe Draggers.  
 Have you been stocking up on foods for our annual Canned Food Dance December 16th?  We are looking forward to filling the barrels for the Oregon Food Bank.
