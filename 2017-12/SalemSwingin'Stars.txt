Our club has been busy with visitations to other clubs.  In October we went to the Willamette Squares Birthday Bash and in November we went to Independence Wagon Wheeler's Veteran's Day Dance.

We have the honor of hosting the First New Dancer Dance for the Mid-Willamette Area on Sunday November 26 at the Salem Square Dance Center, 1:30 -4:30 pm.  Randy Dibble will call.  There will be a Resale Clothing area for the new dancers to find outfits at reasonable prices.

We are also hosting a New Year's Eve Dance at St. Vincent de Paul Church, 1010 Columbia St. NE, Salem on December 31.  Look for the flyer. Tickets are on sale now; $18.00 per dancer or $35 per couple.  Dinner at 8:00 pm followed by dancing from New Dancer through Plus levels with our caller Randy Dibble.

We dance on the first and third Fridays, and if there is a 5th Friday, it is a Plus dance.  December has our 5th Friday Plus dance on December 29th. See you on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
