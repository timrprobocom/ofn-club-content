The Rogue Squares classes are still going great. We have 5 students on a regular basis and a couple who live in Alaska and come to the classes for 2 weeks at a time and then are back in Alaska for 2 weeks. The people who are attending, are having a great time.
The "Angel Cards" are a huge success. We have several Angels who attend both the Rogue Squares and the Star Promenaders classes, so they already have full cards and have redeemed their cards at a regular dance for free. Good going guys, and Thank You.

The Rogue Squares are cooking up something for the New Year. Take a look at the January flyer. It was called to our attention, that some students are not able, for religious reasons, to attend the Caller & Cuer Sunday dances. So, we are sponsoring a new student dance on January 12 to encourage these new dancers to participate at something other than classes. All clubs are invited to bring their class to this dance. Phil Ramey will be the caller and Elaine Funk will cue the rounds. There won't be any Advanced dancing at this dance and the donation is reduced to $5.00 for this one time only.
