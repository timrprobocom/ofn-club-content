Wow! We had a great turnout for the Seaside Sashay.  The club was dark on October 28th as we encouraged everyone to go to that dance.  We enticed them with free pizza and soft drinks at a local pizza house near the convention center.  Twenty-three members, along with two guest callers and their taws were there.  It was a great time of talking, eating and getting to know one another.  Oh yeah, the dancing was great both Friday and Saturday.  Even with her sore knee and new hip my wife had over 16,000 steps on her pedometer just on Saturday.  It is fun to dance with people that you normally don't see.  We danced with folks from as far away as Walla Walla and Spokane.
 Now, on to December dancing.  First is a reminder that Christmas is coming so it is okay to give hints to what you would like to have in your stocking.  By the 9th of December everyone will be needing a break from getting ready for the holidays.  Mike Stout will be calling and Julie Stout cueing.  They assured us they will keep your spirits happy and bright.
 Shopping should be done by the 23rd, with gifts wrapped and stockings hung.  We WILL have a dance on the 23rd with our own Jim Hattrick calling and cueing.  If you have never seen Jim's Christmas get-up it is worth the price of admission.  Plus that we all know how great a caller he is.
 Lastly, from all of the Columbia River Dancers, Have very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
