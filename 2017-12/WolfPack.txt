On November 4th, the Wolf Pack had itâ€™s first dance with a new format of 7:30 pm Plus, and 8:00 to 10:00 pm Mainstream. Our next dance on December 2nd, however, will be geared toward the new dancers. B 51 from 7:00 to 8:30 pm, Mainstream 8:30 to 10:00 pm. Hope to see all of you and your new dancers. We do have a lot of fun.
