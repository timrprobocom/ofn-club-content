Golden Squares is happy to welcome two new members, Rick & Denise Greger!  They are actually returning to dancing after missing a few years. They are happy to be back at it. Come by and say hello! 

We visited M & Mâ€™s birthday dance and that was a lot of fun. As I write this, we are planning to attend the Sweet Home Squarenaders for their Turkey Dance.  We are sure to have a great time as we have in the past. We are looking forward to more fun dancing during the holidays.   

We have an Advance dance on the 5th Saturday at 7:00 p.m. without any rounds. Happy Holidays, Teija
