Hi Everyone,

PLEASE help your clubs by angeling the new dancer classes. Angels are very important to the future of our clubs because they are the impression the new dancers get of the club. We need to help the newbies all we can.

At our last meeting, it was decided not to have a "Fifth Friday" dance in December. We do not want to take anything away from the Star's New Year's Eve dance. It is very important for clubs to respect functions of other clubs in their Council, especially when all the clubs in our Council are struggling.

We will revisit the first Tuesday meeting schedule on April and see how it is going. We will keep you posted.

Don't forget to support the Council and the Clubs in the Rogue Valley.

The next Council meeting will be December 5, 2017 at Denny's Restaurant on Biddle Road at 4:30pm.

There are still "Learn to Square Dance" t-shirts available. I have quite a few 2X's. We have found the t-shirts are a great conversation starter.
