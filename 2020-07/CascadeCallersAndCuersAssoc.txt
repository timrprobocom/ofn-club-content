We were not able to hold our area's annual benefit dance May 30.  We are missing our dances, classes and especially our dancers, but we want everyone to be safe and to be around when we are able to call, cue and dance!

We trust everyone is doing what they can to be safe and that everyone is well and healthy.
 
Our hall in Springfield was closed around March 9 and will remain closed until further notice.  There is nothing at our hall for the month of June.  After that, we will see.  It's a little difficult to social distance with square dancing.  I was talking with a dancer who said if we did "Grand Square" it would take a long time and a big space  We both got a laugh out of that.  Round dancing is tricky as some of our round dancers do not dance with people living in their households.  You can never be too safe with this virus business. 
 
Wishing you all good health,
Christina Corelli, Secretary
