 I’m very happy to report that the Toe’s are doing well and in good spirits.  Lots of us are things like, yard work, home repairs, organizational stuff, etc. along with lots of positive thinking and helping others in our communities.
 It will be so wonderful to get back to dancing and yellow rocking all our friends again!  Until then, keep safe & rock on.
