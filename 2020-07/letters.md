We have received several documents that could be useful to your clubs in deciding what the near-term future holds.

The Oregon State Grange has issued guidance to all Grange masters and members to help them know how to handle hall rentals during the reopening.  No Grange can rent to outside organizations during Phase 1, and even during Phase 2, there are very stringent guidelines about cleaning, both during and after rentals, and about tracking those who attend events.

The Grange is treating dancing rentals as a "gym" event.  Here's the state guidelines for gyms, which puts an upper limit on attendance based on hall size, and prohibits bodily contact between members of different households.

United Square Dancers of America (USDA) has produced a document on "Discussion Items to Start Dancing" that could be a good starting point for a club meeting about our future.  Click on the thumbnail to read the document.

The California Square Dance Council has also produced a document for their members on procedures and guidelines.  Both are worthwhile reading to guide is into dancing again.
