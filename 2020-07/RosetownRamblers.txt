Once we were happy but now we’re dismayed
Because of this virus at home we have stayed
The dance halls are silent where once music played
While six feet apart we just can’t promenade.

It’s been 12 long weeks since we chained down the line,
Or you swung your partner, while I swung mine.
But if you asked, we’d say we’re doing fine
Though not really sitting on cloud nine.

No May graduation, with cake and balloon,
And we canceled our dance in June
We hope in September we can resume,
But can’t say for sure—it’s still far too soon.

So many activities they’ve had to annul
Life without dancing has sure turned out dull
Though once our social calendars were full
We’re now stuck at home, just shooting the bull.

Can’t wait for the day they reopen the halls
And once again they are ringing with calls
In the grand scheme of things, not dancing is small,
But we sure miss hanging and laughing with y’all.

Keep up the hygiene and washing of hands
To check the virus’s spread through our lands
Soon we’ll be back to left allemands
And yellow rocks will be part of our plans.

SYIAS!
