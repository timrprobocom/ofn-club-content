The Country Cut-Ups have new presidents; Robert and Young Lumsden, congratulations.  Robert is also the PAC president, so he will be busy doing both and I am sure that he is capable.  As everyone else, we are waiting for the county and state to tell us when we can start square dancing again.  Club member, Lynn Wunische, has started her line dancing lessons back up at the barn, making sure that they are keeping within the state guidelines for social distancing.
