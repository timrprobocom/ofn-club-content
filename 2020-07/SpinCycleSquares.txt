We have not had a dance since the end of February.  We hope that all of you are staying safe and healthy.  We look forward to dancing with you on Sundays again in the near future.

We are dark the full month of June.  

One of our members, Patrick Finn, moved to Wisconsin.  He had a small farm with animals in Lebanon and before that, Myrtle Creek. We had a farewell 'party' in the parking lot with six vehicles in a huge circle and 7 people sitting on tailgates chatting.  Social distancing at its best!  Patrick was there with his dog, Molly.  Molly is a Lab/Mastiff mix, so is huge.  She's a sweetheart!  We took this opportunity to bid Patrick farewell and good luck.  We're happy he's in Wisconsin close to family, but we miss him.  FYI, Patrick's animals did not go to Wisconsin.  They have new homes here in Oregon.  
 
Stay safe and healthy,
Christina Corelli - Member-At-Large
