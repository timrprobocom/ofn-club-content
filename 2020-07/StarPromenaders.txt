A note from Diamond Lake chairpersons:
It is with a heavy heart we announce the Club voted on June 11, 2020 to cancel this year's Diamond Lake Festival. Be assured this decision was not made lightly. We reviewed all the Phase 2 guidance papers, called their hotline and worked out an easy way to square dance without touching.
Under the guidelines, it appears we could have technically held the festival, but realized it would not take much for just a few people to mess us up if they ignored the festival rules. This could potentially result in the Forest Service "pulling" the permit under which the Diamond Lake Resort operates, putting their entire organization at risk. With major concerns over putting the Resort at any risk, concern over the Phase 2 restrictions, and concern over spreading the COVID-19 virus itself, we concluded that we shouldn't hold the Festival this year.
So, let's look forward to next year's Festival and make up for lost time with Ray Brendzy and Christina Corelli.
The Teddy Bear & Alzheimer Benefit Dances are still on hold. We hope to get them scheduled as soon as we can have a dance or two. Stay tuned for more information on these two very worthy causes. 
Mary Moody is going to have her "Annual Memorial Day Picnic" on August 16th.
The Stars had a "Game Night" on June 26th. It was very interesting, with social distancing and all. Everyone had a good time anyway.  I imagine it was more because they could get out and "socialize" instead of staying home.
You know what, this is getting "OLD" - the canceling or postponing everything.
See you in a square
