 A message from the TVC President, Mike St. Clair:  "Just thought I would touch base with all.  Most of the Counties are in stage one for how long who knows but that is a positive thing.  I can not say what the future is going to bring but think positive.  We still can not get more than 25 people in one group and I think that with the virus still out there we are better off being careful.  Most of our members are on the older side of the scale.  I know we are all missing dancing but there is no reason to take any chances at this point.  I hope everyone is doing well and have not gone CRAZY YET.  Stay in touch..." 
 One of our TVC clubs is exploring the possibility of beginning to gather for Round dance only.  Limiting the number of couples to meet guidelines along with keeping the dance circle large to comply with distancing may be a starting point.  Like square dancing, round dancing is also a contact sport but with cohabitating couples it should not be a problem.
 Please stay safe until we can meet on the dance floor again.
