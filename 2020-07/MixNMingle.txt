 There’s not much happening with M&M’s these days what with our summer hiatus and all but we did want to send a “Happy Birthday” shout out to our club caller, Randy Dibble! Both he and Jeanine Norden have been with us for 20 years now and are very special people to the M&M’s and the square dance community.  We love them and look forward to seeing them in September.
 We will keep you updated on calendar changes thru this OFN report as well as our website:  www.mixandminglesquares.org
