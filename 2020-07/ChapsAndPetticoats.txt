Hello Everyone, 

Sooo what’s happening in your area?  In our local counties of Clackamas, Marion, Multnomah, Washington and Yamhill, there are no square dances, grange events or other county fairs/events (including the Oregon State Fair) happening right into early September.   

In the Square (and Round) dance world:  we greet with hugs (or handshakes), we dance holding hands and with other partners to form a circle or square.  We could cut out the hugs part, but without contact and voice communication, we cannot dance!  Thus Chaps and Petticoats, made the decision to close through August.  We shall concentrate our energies on gearing up for square dance classes come mid-September.

In this ‘alternate universe’ time, Maplewood Grange is also closed to rentals (that’s us) until the “lockdown of mass-gatherings” and full-building sterilization policies are lifted, as there is not enough staff to provide (nearly) full-time janitorial cleanliness.  On a positive note, however, the lockdown has allowed us to pool our man-power and make much-desired improvements to Maplewood Grange...we hope to share the upgrades with you in the near future...hopefully September.

We are glad to have the OFN as a means of staying in-touch.

Stay healthy, 

Betty Chipps
