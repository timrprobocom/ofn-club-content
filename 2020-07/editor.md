Many of our clubs dance in Grange buildings around the state.  The state Grange organization  has issued some guidance based on the Governor's guidance.  Their documents are included in the articles below.

If your county is not yet in Phase 2, then a Grange cannot rent to you at all.  If your county is in Phase 2, then they can rent the hall for a dance, but with restrictions.  Total occupancy must be based on the 6' distancing rule.  So, take the hall size, and divide by 36 (square feet). For a 30' x 50' floor, that means only 42 people can be in the building at once.  Everyone attending will need to fill out a form giving their name, address and phone number, in case they need to do "contact tracing".  These forms must be kept for 60 days.

Dancing events fall under the guidance for gyms.  What that means is no bodily contact except for household members.  This would seem to prohibit ALL square dancing, until we get to Phase 3, which means until a vaccine is available.

I'm afraid we are in for a long dry spell.
