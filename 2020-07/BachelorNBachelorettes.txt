     About a month ago, our president called each of us individually and said he was taking a poll of how many of our members were still alive!  How very thoughtful of him as it was election time and, besides, we are told to check on our elderly people to make sure they are okay.

     Our board is the same as last fiscal year, since we never held elections.
