Well, we are now in our "normal" dark season.

We will be looking for a new club cuer this fall as well as a caller. Frances is moving to California to be close to her family there. So once we are able to hold dances again, we will be doing guest callers and cuers for a few dances.

Our usual parades and demos are still undecided as the groups putting them on have not yet made a final decision on if they will still be happening.

Hope to see you soon.
