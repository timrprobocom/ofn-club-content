Greetings from Yreka
We hope everyone is doing well and staying safe. We recently learned that the county fair has been canceled, which means we will not be dancing anytime soon. At this point in time it appears it will be Sep. or Oct. before we will get back to dancing. Our Birthday dance is usually in Sep. I guess all we can do is hope that dance happens. There will be lots of things to look at before we make a decision, for example, where to dance, a caller, and what current regulations we will have to look at. I do want to say that when we do have a dance it will be FREE, to all dancers. It will be our way of welcoming all of our friends back. We are being very cautious about when and where to start back. We are watching what other clubs and callers are doing before we jump back into things. Whether a person believes this whole thing is some kind of big scam, political, driven by Politicians, large corporations etc. I personally don't want to be the one in a thousand club or caller that has a dancer become infected with this virus. For me it is hard to grasp how all of this has impacted our life, mainly because it hasn't hit home for me, meaning I don't have any family or friends that have this virus, and most of the cases are hundreds or thousands of miles away. Our group of dancers are very special to us. One had a double lung transplant, one has terminal cancer, one has advanced Parkinson's, another person's back had been broken in two places, two are considered legally deaf. As you can see my group is fragile so being cautious is a priority. Please stay safe, strong, and keep faith that God will guide us and our leaders thru these weird times.
Hope to see you soon
Dean & Sherrie
