ReVuNQ started dancing again on June 4 with 4.5 couples for the first night dancing since March. We did a lot of review to see how much we needed to remember.
We decided to try our 44th birthday dance on June 25 when hopefully Marion County is in Phase 2 and we can have 50 people in the dance hall. There is plenty of room for social distancing and we have a full candy bowl for refreshments temporarily. Come and see us, bring your own refreshments, no fresh food and surfaces will be disinfected after everyone leaves.
Stephanie Lozano is taking the summer off to care for her husband John, who had major heart surgery on May 4. He is home and working on getting his strength back.
We look forward to seeing some intermediate round dancers to get some floor time in and getting to see people after being home for so long.
