 May was another month under our Covid 19 belts.  What happened?  Nothing on the dance floor unless you’re Chet Wolter who’s been practicing rounds most days.  A few members have wandered to second homes or ventured out in RV’s.  Thank goodness for sunshine and mostly sunny weather as walking has become exercise #1.  I’m taking a long hard look at the wireless earbuds like my granddaughters use.
 At our house we’ve pretty much given up on television sporting events.  The cause?
 - Everything’s a rerun.  The 1975 Rose Bowl was just terrible football.  Can you punt?
 - On ESPN2 we found the 2020 Canadian Axe throwing championship which was compelling for a while as they were throwing axes in a tavern while drinking adult beverages.
 - ESPN2 also offered a rock skipping competition recorded on Mackinac Island, Michigan.  The island was scenic, the competitors were plentiful but I couldn’t tell how many skips there were with the waves rolling in.  The play-by-play guy was willing to take the word of the judges as you really couldn’t tell.
 - But my favorite was the Johnsonville Brat Corn Hole competition.  Now the Hoedowners are known for their Turkey Toss Dance each November which uses corn bags and boards.  We always have corn hole to play when we have a beach trip so I felt this held more interest and had practical applications.  I found out they spin the bags while throwing but EEEGADS professional corn hole bags have a sticky side (suede).  It was like finding out footballs and golf balls have GPS.  I’ll try to use the experience as an instructional video but I still have to get the bag to the board.
 If I’m leaving the house, I don’t worry about what clothes to wear but which mask to bring; black, white, polka dot or floral.  On the one hand, time weighs heavy and yet by the time the sun goes down I wonder where the day went.  Everyone misses everyone but we’re so happy that the Hoedowners have avoided the virus and remain healthy.  
 We’ll see it again; haircuts, pedicures, manicures, sitting in a restaurant, joining friends for a cup of coffee or a dinner out, dancing at the Aloha Grange, finger foods at dances, sitting closer than six feet and giving everyone a hug.
 The Hoedowners are making summer plans and soon we’ll tell you all about it.  Until then keep up the good work.
