 RIP Summer Festival of 2020.   We fondly remember all the wonderful plans we made just for you.  After a year of rest we look forward to Summer Festival in 2021.   Personally I had a wonderful time visiting clubs advertising the festival.  Many of these I had  never visited and learned I had been missing out meeting some really friendly and special dancers.  This period of isolation has taught me exploring new places and meeting new people is exciting and we all need to do this more often. 
 We are still hoping to meet up for our Picnic August 12th at Noble Woods Park.  Here we will be outside and even be six feet apart and will bring our individual food and drinks instead of a buffet.   A final decision has not yet been made. 
 When, o when, will we dance again?  No one knows but I think we may have to take some remedial lessons by the time we do.  I hope the callers will take it easy on us. 
 While we wait to dance reach out to someone by phone, text, email,  or what ever you fancy just to say “How are you?”   Help out the postal service by mailing a letter.   In the meantime hold out hope to attend planned dances in the future.
We lost two dear long time members in May.  Don Layton and Grace Phares.  Grace was 99 years young, and was buried in her burgundy and white club outfit.
 The following message is for your information when life as we used to know begins again: We dance on most holidays.  Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 p.m. - 3:00, at the Aloha Grange, 3425 SW 185th, Beaverton, 97006.
