Are we still checking on those we know don’t have someone else to check on them? Please keep that up or if you are not doing so – please start.

Now – what have you been doing since we aren’t dancing? Are you trying out this “couples” square dancing? Are you working on other hobbies? Can we see what you have been doing? Please consider taking a picture and sending it in with a caption to Kathy Roberts to post on the Federation Facebook page or sending to Tim Roberts to put in the OFN.  

Who does your club flyer? Can they gather pictures from the club and put together a “what we are doing” flyer to post instead of a dance flyer?

Let us at least hope for good weather so that we can at least be outside in our yards instead of just stuck in the house.
