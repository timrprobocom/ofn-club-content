Due to COVID 19, we will put our club on pause for the time being. Our club board of directors have been holding teleconference style meetings including elections of officers. We will remain  in a holding pattern until we have an idea of how it will be possible to square dance safely in the future. 

Bottom line is we miss you all, hope you remain healthy and we will let you know when we can dance again.
