The Charlie's are still in a holding pattern with no classes or dances happening since Mid March. We sure miss everyone. New Club officer were elected on 6/18. We have a dance on July 18th, but we will decide soon if that will be able to take place. Watch the Facebook page/website to find out. If you have any questions,  don't hesitate to contact a board member. 
Hope to be dancing again soon and hope everyone is staying well!! We will be having a Boatnik Meeting soon and finalize flyers for the 2021 Festival with Jet Roberts & Rey (Sherry) Garza.
