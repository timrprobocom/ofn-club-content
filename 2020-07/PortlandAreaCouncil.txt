My revelation is still our Tumbleweeds club being the first sq. club to get back to dancing in our area.  Instead of their usual one square, there will be dancers lined up clear around their building, waving their $5 bills, and clamoring to get in.

Although not in our council, we’re looking jealously at Re-Vu-NQ in Salem for getting back to dancing.  Just call Marilyn Schmit (503-508-0539) for reservations.  Ah, yes, whoever would’ve “thunk” we’d have to have reservations for a dance? - Gotta be flexible!

And speaking of being flexible, let’s not forget the Boring Barn is holding line dance class.  I can’t find anything about them, but if they were a federated club maybe I could?  Anyway, contact anyone at the Cut-Ups for more info.

As I think about it, it would be a great time to have a flash mob downtown.  Of course, we’d still need to practice social distancing - unless we gather after about 8:PM. (grin).  And by the time the police made their way to us, we’d all be standing around saying, “Dance?  What dance?  I don’t see any dance.”  Who knows?  It might even bless us with free publicity from the overhead helicopter and furnish us with a few recruits for our classes.  All we have to do is find a caller who will bring the sound equipment on a bus!
