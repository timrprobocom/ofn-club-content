 The CRDâ€™s wished and wished we were dancing, but it was not to be.  We do have a group of people do some line dancing via Zoom.  The are getting together and learning and socializing on the web.
 We are closed until who knows when.  We probably will be in the fourth stage of the governor's plan which means into the summer season.  As we are dark because of high temperatures in the grange hall, it seems most likely we will start again in September.  If things go exceedingly well, however, we could try to dance once or twice before September.  Everyone is anxious to get back.  
 In the meantime, stay healthy!
