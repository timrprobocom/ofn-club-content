 The Valley River Dancers (VRD) are still anxiously awaiting the time when we will be able to get back to dancing when it is deemed safe to do so.  As of this time we do not have any new news to report or up coming dances to invite you to attend.  
 We hope all is well with our fellow dancers and look forward to the time when we can meet once again.
 Wishing you the best,
  Judy Zimmerman
