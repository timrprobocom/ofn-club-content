 Dear square dance friends,  This has been an interesting time hasn't it?  During our usual square dance calendar, clubs would be shifting to summer schedules, most only having a specialty dance or two.  R Square D would have been changing to Wednesday dances until September.  But that was then, this is now.  
 And so, as the rest of you, we wait.  Our club will do a reassessment in July.  One of the considerations will be the Octoberfest dance.   Please watch for that decision as the time for communicating our plans will be short by then.
 By the time we dance again we will need a refresher on those more complicated calls.  No concern there, Craig does an excellent job of getting us moving around the square.  
 Blessings to you all, and may you be healthy until we meet again in a square.  For current information see: www.r-square-d.info.
