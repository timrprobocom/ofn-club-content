As are all the other clubs in this area and around the state, we are sad that there is no square or round dancing being offered at present due to social distancing rules.  We are hopeful that in the not too distant future we will have found a way to conduct our dances with good social distancing in mind.  But at this point not one has figured out how to do this.  On the Internet we’ve seen examples where groups have tried—dancing outdoors and in phantom squares or using social media apps.  All seem to be fun experiments but probably would not work well on the advanced level and would require a live caller who really knows that he’s doing to keep track of those phantoms!  

When we do get back to dancing, we will look forward to greeting any new or old advanced dancers in our area or any willing to drive in from out of area for our dances held Sunday afternoons once or twice a month from 2 to 4PM at the Emerald Square Dance Center at 2095 Yolanda in Hall B behind the center in Springfield.

Meanwhile we hope all are staying safe and that this too shall pass.
