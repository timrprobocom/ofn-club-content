We have not had a dance since our birthday dance in February.  We will all be very rusty when we finally are able to get back to dancing—whenever that may be.  Single Trees has been trying to conduct its annual membership drive—at a distance.  Unfortunately, without a dance to attend most members seem to be forgetting that dues are due.  Our membership dues are going up on September so we hope our members will fill out their forms and get their dues in.

We held elections in March with most of our board remaining in place in their same capacity with the exception of Don Schimonitz who rejoined the board once again.   We appreciate his volunteering to help guide our club—at least we will be grateful once we get back to having regular board meetings and dances.

Stay well, fellow dancers,
