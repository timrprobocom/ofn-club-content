 Our Board has been meeting regularly as usual on Zoom, which has been working well for us.  And since it’s nearly time to pay membership dues, the board voted to give members the options of 1) paying a small amount now to maintain membership and to help cover some upcoming regular costs for this year, with additional dues prorated later if we begin dancing again, or 2) paying the full membership now, which would help bolster our finances for eventual reopening.
 Here’s hoping we all keep following social distancing guidelines so that when reopening happens we stay open and dance again soon.
