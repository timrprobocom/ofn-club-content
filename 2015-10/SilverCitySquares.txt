 A little more exciting report this time. Silver City Squares youth participated at the State Fair dancing on Saturday, September 5. We received a welcome surprise when Mariah Buchheit was awarded the State Square Dance Scholarship.
      We started our lessons on Tuesday, September 8. We are hoping for a good turnout this year as we have been busy contacting people to come. Petrina Buchheit
