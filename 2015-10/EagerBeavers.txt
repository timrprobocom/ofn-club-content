Our long time caller, George Clark, is retiring from full time calling October 1 and will be missed by many.  The Eager Beavers will then have multiple callers.  Jim Hattrick is recovering and will take the 3rd Monday as in the past.  Daryl Clendenin and Daryl Kalmbach will call the other Mondays.  See our site for current schedule.  This will be a big change for a long established club such as ours but we are looking forward to the mental stimulation of learning different ways of square dancing.
 I have observed that Eager Beavers always enjoy eating good food, talking, and games in that order.  That is exactly what made our picnic in Noble Woods a pleasant afternoon for thirty or so.  It was a little warm and the bees liked the smell of our food but it was all good.  Dancing on the grass was not a good idea.  
 Our visitation to the Sunset Promenader&rsquo;s Anniversary Dance October 3rd promises to be a blast.  It is a dinner dance and the caller is Dan Preedy.  See Nan or Karen for tickets.  Do not miss this one.
 Flag Day is the 12th, a good day to show off your patriotic colors.  Then come to our Halloween Dance dressed in your favorite costume (or not)  October 26th.  
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, Rounds 1:00 - 1:30; Plus 1:30 - 3:15 p.m., at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.  This hall is air-conditioned which makes dancing a pleasure during the summer.
