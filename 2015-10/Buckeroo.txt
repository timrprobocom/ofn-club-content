Did you think the summer zipped by?  We surely thought so at the Buckeroo Barn. Before we know it, our clubs will be planning Halloween Hoedowns and summer will be just a pleasant memory.  Some of us will be wishing we had not complained about the hot weather because we will be bundling up to keep warm.  Because we were going to be dancing four nights at the Fair this month, we went dark for our first Saturday Dance in August. 
Our 3rd Saturday Dance dance was held on National Lemon Meringue Pie Day.  Many of the dancers were decked out in yellow and we snacked on every conceivable type of lemon or yellow dessert imaginable. An ice cold glass container of lemonade was a great addition to our &ldquo;Think lemon, wear yellow&rdquo; dance theme.   We wound down the month of August with our annual picnic/potluck held at the home of one of our members.  Fifty folks dined on burgers and other potluck food and the afternoon wasn&rsquo;t complete until we were treated to Dick Stevenson stepping up to the microphone and entertaining us with one of his lengthy but riveting 10 minute jokes.

Happy Dancing,
