You may not realize it, but this issue actually represents the end of the 
first year of the online OFN -- my twelfth issue.
<p>
So far, things have gone quite smoothly.  The council delegates are feeding
me news items, the club representatives are updating their dance flyers and
schedules and their class schedules, I'm getting some articles every month,
and we're getting a supply of advertising.
<p>
I have had very occasional feedback from readers, most of it positive,
some of it critical, but I'd like to hear more.  As we bring this first 
year to a close, let me know what you think. For example:
<ul>
<li>Do you read the club news?  At ths point, since it doesn't cost any
extra, I am not limiting the length of the articles at all.  Should I 
continue that?  
<li>Do you look at the photos?  If you do submit photos, please be aware 
that photos taken on a phone tend to be blurry, because it's so hard to
keep a phone still.  Take a quick look at your photo before you send it.
<li>Do you check out the advertising?  We're now getting several ads
every month, and I'd like to know whether our advertisers are getting 
their money's worth.
<li>Do you download the Round Of The Month?
<li>Are there things I should change?
<li>Are there things that look bad?
</ul>
<p>
I'm looking forward to your comments.
