On September 14th,  Sundown Round Dance Club of Bend had their 2nd annual "Back to UR School" Dance. It's our opportunity to give back to the Community and donate School Supplies to the local School Children. and donate they did! The Dancers truly gave from their hearts. They donated everything from Pens & Pencils, notebooks, backpacks, and even the fancy crayon boxes,  with the sharpener in the back, they donated everything that a child would need for school.  Carol Bro & Mark McDonald cued a great dance for us. I would just to say Thank you all so much for your kindness and generosity in making this a huge success.  You have made a difference in someone's life because of your kindness.  You created a smile on a Child's face and mine too!
