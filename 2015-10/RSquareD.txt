R Square D welcomed the month of August in with a Hawaiian themed dance with guest caller Jim Raupp.  A good time was had followed up with banana splits with all the toppings.  We appreciated all the clubs that came to dance in the summer heat with us.  Visiting clubs were Harbor Haylofters, Cougar Squares, Toe Draggers, Stardust and Ruff and Ruffles.  We will wrap up this very warm month with a back to school dance on the 26th.  
 As we head into autumn and the changing of the seasons we are excitedly looking forward to a new set of lessons starting on October 7th.  It is always fun to share the steps of the dance with new students.
 We hope to see lots of you at our Octoberfest this year.  It will be at the Rose Valley Grange on October 2nd-4th.  Those attending will be entertained by the River City Riders and a weekend of fun dancing with Les Seeley as our featured caller and Tami Helms cueing.  Please come and join us for some good old square and round dancing, good food and fellowship with new and old friends alike.
 For more information about the R Square D club please visit our website at www.r-square-d.info or friend us on Facebook.  Our caller is Craig Abercrombie and our cuer is Lonnie Sycks.
