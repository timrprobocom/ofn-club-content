Beachcombers hosted another successful Battle Rock Festival over Labor Day Weekend.  Dancers came from as far north as Portland, east from Central Oregon, Medford and as far south as Sacramento California.  The weekend was packed with activities such as surf dancing, a demo in town, apple cider pressing, pie making, ice cream making and of course lots of visiting and catching up by old friends.  

   We are looking forward to the possibility of having square dance lessons this year.  Ray Graves has agreed to be our teacher, so we have flooded the town nearby with flyers, and we have talked to people wherever we go about the benefits of square dancing.

   We continue to dance on the 4th Saturday of each month from 3-6 pm, and always welcome visitors!
