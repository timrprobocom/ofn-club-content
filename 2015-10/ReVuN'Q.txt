It is Labor Day as I write this and our club will start Waltz lessons on September 10 with reviewing steps and movements. Not necessarily from the beginning, but steps that we have problems with in completing an entire dance. We finished our Bolero workshops and put some names to movements that we were unsure of. 
     October will see us hosting a Halloween Round Dance party night on the 29th. Two hours of just dancing and having fun with guests and songs that are somewhat related to the holiday. Come see us from 7-9 p.m. that night with or without a costume and dance your shoes off.
     We will also start planning our New Year&rsquo;s Eve dance by putting ideas on paper and getting some advertising out and around. Look for something soon and print it and put it up on your bulletin board to help us have a good crowd. Marilyn Schmit
