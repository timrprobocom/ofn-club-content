Greetings from the Buzzin Bees! I just came from a planning meeting and I am excited for the new year. We had a good summer and I was so pleased to see Elmer Toops. He is looking better than I have seen him in years thanks to the kidney transplant he had this summer. Come to a dance and see for yourself.

We will be having a change in callers in October when we welcome K.C. Curtis and his wife Linda to the Buzzin Bees.  We will have great dances with Debbie Combs cueing and K.C. Calling. Hope you can join us.

By the time you read this we will have started lessons. We are hoping for a large class.  Sunday nights at 6pm starting 9/20/15.

See you in a square.
Debbie Broers
