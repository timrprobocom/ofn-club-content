The Sunset Promenaders had 23-dancers at the Annual TVC Hahn Picnic and Barn Dance on August 29th.  Daryl and Yvonne Clendenin called and cued.  The potluck picnic is usually down by the pond; but the weather report said rain so we had the dinner in the barn.  It was a fun time as usual.
 The Promenaders Plus Dances are October 1st and 15th with Darrell Kalmbach calling and Ken Pratt cueing.  
 Please reserve October 3rd on your calendar to come to the Sunset Promenaders 30th Anniversary.  We have a national caller Dan Preedy and Ken Pratt cueing; and we are having a full ham dinner at 6:30; start the dance about 7:30; with a dessert break at 10:00.  Tickets for the dance are $15 per couple or $8 per person.
 The Seaside Sashay is on October 16th and 17th at the Convention Center; so fill out the registration form; send it in with money; we will send you your ribbons; and the program book.  Daryl Clendenin and Chuck Garner are calling and Debbie Taylor is cueing.  The Sunset Promenaders will be dark on Saturday October 17th.
