Valley Squares is dark this month as we support our neighbors, Sunset Promenaders, at their Anniversary Dance October 3rd and at Seaside Sashay, October 16th-18th, where the featured callers will be our own Chuck Garner and our sister-club's Daryl Clendenin.  Our August Visitation to Garibaldi garnered a banner and good will.  We had a fun day visiting local sites before meeting for dinner and crossing the street to an entertaining and friendly dance sponsored by the Wave Steppers.
 Valley Squares, Rosetown Ramblers, and friends spread the gospel of square dancing at three demonstration dances: the Crawfish Festival, the Multnomah Days Parade, and the Highlands Community dance which was followed by our annual picnic hosted by Al Maner and Mary Davis.  Thanks to everyone who participated and to Janienne Alexander for organizing the Crawfish event and Jeff Knapp for the Multnomah parade.  Special gratitude to Chuck Garner, who donated his voice, time and choreography to all three events.
 A hearty group of visitors to our Hawaiian Luau and Hot August Nights Cruisin' dances resulted in more friendships and healthy ways to spend summer evenings.
