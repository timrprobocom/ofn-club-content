Our fall lessons start on September 28 and we're hoping for a good-sized class. We kicked off our dance season on Sept. 12 and are grateful for the lovely wood floor at our dance hall.
     Later on in October, the 24th, we're having our yearly Halloween dance. It's a fun and festive time! Happy Autumn everyone!  Karen
