Willamette Squares had a nice turnout for their watermelon dance. There was plenty of ripe, juicy watermelon for refreshments and as usual, everyone had a great time dancing. Unfortunately the time and place were not conducive to a watermelon seed spitting contest. We'll have to postpone that activity until next summer's annual picnic outdoors. 
      Willamette Squares has been working on revitalizing our club. Our most recent meeting was hosted by Shari. We are focusing on getting more exposure in the community by articles in the Statesman Journal, as well as posting and handing out flyers, postcards, and business cards. A few car door magnets are on order so that wherever we go in our cars, there will always be a notice for square dancing. We now have a facebook page and will soon have our own website. We are making an effort to get the word out about square dance lessons that begin toward the end of September.
      We are excited to be hosting the upcoming induction ceremony of our own Georgette Hagerman as the new president of the Mid-Willamette Area Council on September 21 at the Salem Square Dance Center beginning at 7:00 PM. We hope to see a large crowd of supporters to share in this momentous occasion.
     Members of Willamette Squares have been putting the final touches on their summer travels. John camped at Mt. Rainier, Gary and Nancy have taken many excursions across the country, and Nancy and Brice were recently in Washington state.
     With Oktoberfest just around the corner, we are looking forward to our next dance with the very fitting theme, Oktoberfest. Come ready to put your best foot forward. Ed will undoubtedly be requesting the polka. If you have lederhosen and dirndls, wear them, and whet your appetite for some fresh Oktoberfest sausage. Jodee Howard
