The Toe Dragger&rsquo;s had a busy month of August with 3 visitations, picking up 3 banners.  We had a great turnout, for all 3 visits.  We would like to thank the WaveSteppers for their $25 donation to Susan G. Komen Foundation.  Another big thank you to everyone who helped us with donations and time to make our special dance &ldquo;Man Enough to Wear Pink&rdquo; a complete success.
 Our campout up at Detroit Lake almost was cancelled by wind, bad weather, fire danger and low lake water, &ldquo;But&rdquo; the Toes have a fun group of members that are full of spunk, spirit and determination.  We can always have a fun time, whatever happens.
 Our mainstream lessons started with a bang Wednesday evenings at our grange.  Bev will be teaching round dance lessons in January 2016.
 This month we have our Fall Festival Dance on October 2nd.  October 16th you&rsquo;ll find us at the Odd Fellows Hall in Hillsboro celebrating Halloween with our Thriller of the Night Dance.
 We&rsquo;ve been together as a club for 40 years.  May the next 40 bring us together, dancing with new and old friends.  The Square Dance Community is the best.
