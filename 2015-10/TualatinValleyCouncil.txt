Although the weather did not cooperate with us, the Hahn Barn Dance was a rousing success.  We moved the potluck picnic into the barn and had lots of room when some of the dancers found additional seating in the adjoining storage buildings.  We had 12 squares attending including a visiting couple from Tempe Arizona.  Thanks goes to Daryl and Yvonne Clendenin for their great calling and cueing.  The Sunset Promenaders had the highest percentage of their club in attendance with just over 3 squares to claim the TVC Banner.  This makes two in a row for them!  Since the Hoedowners were a very close second, the Promenaders presented the award to them.
 The next TVC event will be the Tri-Council Dance on Halloween night.  This fifth Saturday dance will be held at the Clark County Square Dance Center in Vancouver Washington and will be hosted by the Portland Area Council (PAC).  The featured caller will be Darrell Kalmbach with Molly Combs cueing.  Costumes are encouraged but not required.
