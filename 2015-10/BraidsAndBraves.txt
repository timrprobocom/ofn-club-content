Fall is upon us! Lots of leaves and branches came down in that storm. Unfortunately, it also drowned out our club camp-out at Flying M Ranch. Better luck next year! 
     We had two squares of dancers for our Demo at Yamhill Valley Heritage Center in August, including several from other clubs. There were lots of spectators, including some huge tractors. We even had someone brave enough to join us for a tip! Square Dancing is easy to learn and SO much fun!  We also had nearly three squares at our dance later in the evening. 
     We started offering Square Dance classes at the Yamhill Valley Heritage Center (a fascinating place to visit, by the way) on September 10. Waltz classes are also available. See you in a square somewhere. Carmen
