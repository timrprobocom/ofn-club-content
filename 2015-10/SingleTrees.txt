Summer draws to a close with a bit of chill in the air; even a touch of rain.  Much too soon for that nonsense!

We continue to be delighted with the good news regarding Jim Hattrick's recovery.  It will be wonderful to dance to his calling again.

We look forward to our October dances.  Richard Lane and Jackie Gale are scheduled for October 9th.  Our Halloween Dance, October 23rd, will feature Scott Zinser and Jackie Gale.  Costumes are encouraged.
