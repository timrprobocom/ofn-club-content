We heard that there is a rumor circulating to the effect that we will turn into an Advanced club.  If anyone tells you that, tell the person that it isn't so.  We started the club to be a plus club for individuals, and we plan to keep it that way.  When we started it more than 30 years ago, there was no place to dance plus on west side and nowhere for singles to dance plus as singles.  We resolved that situation and are still happily dancing PLUS.
