September was a great month with lots of dancing! Our first Friday dance was well attended with Chuck Garner calling and Jeanine Norden cueing. September 18 was our Annual Corn N Cluck dance. The Chicken put in an appearance to everyone's delight. A big thank you to all of the Stars for their help with the food and decorations. Mainstream Lessons started on September 9 with a big turnout. Thanks to all of you Angels out there!
     We dance the first and third Fridays of the month in October. Our Fifth Friday Plus (October 30) dance will be a Spooktackular Halloween Dance. Look for the flyer for additional information. Our caller is Randy Dibble and cuer Jeanine Norden. 
See you all on the Dance Floor!!  Sheila Machado
