Our first dance of the season was a great success. We did a "Poker Dance". Everyone enjoyed the dance and earned prizes for the best poker hand. We had four squares in attendance and three squares dancing the poker tip. 
      Our second dance of the season on September 12 is planned as a "SOCK HOP". We will be dancing in a soda fountain theme with popcorn popping, root beer floats, and all singing calls. George Hermann will be calling and Ralph Lambert will be cueing.
     We also as a club are now listed on the "Where's T Dance website. So go to wheresthedance.com and see what the IWW is doing and when. Also look at September's OFN for the flyer about our "Sock Hop".  Sandy Eddings
