On September 1 Valley River Dancers proudly graduated five A1-A2 dancers. Speaking of September -- it's time to usher in the fall, cooler weather, and students going back to school, especially square dance school with VRD. Caller Randy Dibble just started a mainstream class for new dancers and a new Advanced class for masochistic experienced dancers! It's not too late to join.

       Just what the doctor ordered to cope with shorter, cooler days: our September 25 sock hop and Fifth Saturday Advanced Dance on Halloween. (Note: Advanced dance is at Senior Estates Auditorium in Woodburn). And a special welcome back to Judy Zimmerman, who was in our hearts but not at our dances over the summer. Perrin Damon
