Fall leaves, a chill in the air, and hot pancakes mark the arrival of autumn. Some of you are thinking, &ldquo;How did hot pancakes get it that list?&rdquo; If you are a Country Cut-Up, it makes perfect sense. October brings our annual Pancake Breakfast fund raiser. Sunday, October 18, there will be hot pancakes, eggs, ham, coffee, and juice for sale at the Boring Barn. Dancers will turn into cooks, servers, and clean up crew. There will be a gift bazaar as well. We hope many of you can join us. It is the same weekend as the Seaside Sashay this year, but since there is no dancing on Sunday, you can all sashay your was back to Boring before we close at 1:00 PM.

Fall is also the time when we hold new dancer mainstream lessons. Ours will already be underway, and October 1st will be the last open lesson for newcomers to join us. Lessons are taught by Scott Zinser at the Boring Barn at 7:30 to 9:30 each Thursday evening. Scott is a very good teacher, so if you know dancers who have been through lessons, but are struggling, this is a great place for a review and we can always use angels.

October brings us another fifth Saturday dance that falls on Halloween. So if you are looking for a hot Halloween Party, come to the barn, in your best costume or dance clothes. The food is always good and we are a friendly crowd. Dancing starts at 7:00 PM with some plus, and mainstream starts at 7:30 with intermediate rounds mixed in. You can pass out candy to the neighborhood goblins, then head over to burn off some calories from all that candy you sampled! &ldquo;The more you dance, the better you feel!&rdquo;
