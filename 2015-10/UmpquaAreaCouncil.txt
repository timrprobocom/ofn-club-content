Wowie-zowie, August was a super fun but busy time for us here in Roseburg.  We were busy preparing the dance floor for the Fair, then actually dancing at the Fair, and of course, once the fair was over the dance floor had to be taken apart and hauled back out to the barn. A big thanks needs to go out to the work crew volunteers who helped make it happen. The evening temperatures at the Fair were perfect, and each of the four nights we danced to a different caller, so we had lots of variety.  Scott, Dale, Chuck and Don did their best to
attract the fair goers who were walking right by us to stop and watch us dance as well as toss out great plugs for the Buckeroo&rsquo;s upcoming lessons.  Neil was our Cuer each of the nights and as always, he made it easy for everyone to round dance. Our Timber 8&rsquo;s delegate, Laura Rowe  is moving back to Washington State.  We will miss her hard work and dedication to square dancing but at the same time say goodbye to her with a smile,  wish her the very best and know that another club will be lucky to have her in their square.
