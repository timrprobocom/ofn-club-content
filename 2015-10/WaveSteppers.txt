The Wave Steppers&rsquo; last dance of the 2015 season will be Saturday, October 10th, on the Dance Floor at Garibaldi City Hall.  This will be a Fall-themed Dance, with club caller Joe Wrabek and line dance instructor Gwen Kiel.  Line dancing starts at 7 pm, with squares at 7:30.
 The club will be dark for the winter&mdash;but it&rsquo;ll be a short winter.  Monthly dances start again in March, with dances in March, April, May, June, July, August, September, and October.  All the dances are held the second Saturday of the month, and are on the Dance Floor at Garibaldi City Hall.
 In addition, a new round of square dance classes starts the second Wednesday in January.  The classes are held at the Tillamook Elks Lodge, 1907 Third St. in downtown Tillamook, and are free.  Please visit our webpage for up to date information, www.wavesteppers.org.
