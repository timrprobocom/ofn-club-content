The Silver Stars continue to dance on the 2nd and 4th Saturday's at the Hazel Dell Grange with Chuck Garner calling 2nd Saturday's and Darrell Kalmbach having calling honors on the 4th Saturday's. Dorothy Lowder does the cueing for us on both accounts. We will have had our mystery trip by the time this goes to print--who knows, we might have visited you for this evening of fine entertainment, fine dancing and "Friendship set to music". Our lessons are being planned and will probably begin after the first of the year. Here's to a great season of dancing. YELLOW ROCKS TO ALL
