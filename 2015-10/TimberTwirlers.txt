Timber Twirlers started lessons in Sept so will let you know how we did in the next edition.
     I was interviewed by the local paper about our search for a new dance venue and they did a very nice write up. We still do not have a new home so we will be dancing at the IOOF hall, 738 SE 5th, Albany again. Our Pirate dance will be Oct 2, which is always a great dance.
      We recently lost a dear member of our group, Bob Cox. He has not danced with us for several years but he and his late wife were some of the founding members of the Timber Twirlers and he danced with us into his 80's. He will be greatly missed. Sandy
