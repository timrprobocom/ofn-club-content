Aug 12 was our &ldquo;Welcome Back Jim Hattrick Dance&rdquo;, the first dance he&rsquo;s called in exactly nine months.  Our scoreboard director, Goldie Goalie commented that Jim beat out Mike Sikorsky 104 to 101 dancers, making Jim Hattrick our biggest draw of the year to date! Both dances kept our parking patrol attendant Bruno Bruiser busy all night.  (No, you can&rsquo;t just park just anywhere.)

In an unusual move, the B&B&rsquo;s offered long-time member Jerry Addington a permanent paid position, setting up our kitchen and dining area.  We talked about having a paid position for years, but waffled on it.  Finally, we did it!  Of course, he&rsquo;ll have other unpaid help to boss around, like Brent Burntwell doing the cooking, and sous chef Sue on the salads.  Honestly, we have some pretty good food.
