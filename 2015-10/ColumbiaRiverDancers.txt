We were blessed with many visitors and lots of squares over the summer.  We were dark on 8/8 as several club members attended USA West where we met some wonderful new friends from Montana and neighboring states.  
 In early August, our caller quit and at the same time we lost our &ldquo;.com&rdquo; web address and Facebook page.  Therefore, our web address has changed and we've re-built our Facebook page.  Despite these circumstances, we were overwhelmed by the support shown by our friends at our 8/22 dance, called by Mike Stout and cued by Julie Stout.  In fact we ended up with almost 7 squares!  The Toe Draggers visited us and some visitors came from as far as Hood River and Cougar.
 While we search for a new club caller, we look forward to an exciting lineup of guest callers/cuers, including Jim Hattrick, who will be calling our 9/12 and 11/28 dances.  Please check our web site and new Facebook site for updates regarding callers/cuers for upcoming dances:  
<a href="www.ColumbiaRiverDancers.org">www.ColumbiaRiverDancers.org</a> or <a href="www.ColumbiaRiverDancers.club">www.ColumbiaRiverDancers.club>/a>, and 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ColumbiaRiverDancers">www.facebook.com/ColumbiaRiverDancers</a>. (Please &ldquo;like&rdquo; us!) 
 Our lessons will start in September.  They will be taught by Mark Wheeler and Jim Hattrick as a team.  We plan to follow the same lesson cycle as the Hoppers and hope this will add an element of flexibility to Vancouver square dance lessons, making it easier for students to double up on lessons and/or make up lessons they've missed.
