The Tri Squares had their 17th anniversary dance on September 18th.  Some may not know that Tri Squares is actually a formation of three former square dance clubs.  These clubs include the Tigard 59ers, The Merry C-Saws, and The Robin Hoods.  The three clubs joined together during September of 1998.  The club is fortunate to still have some of its founding members.  The Tri Squares logo has three squares that overlap one another.  The three squares represent the three different clubs.
 We will be having two dances during the first month of Fall.  Terry Halley will be calling and Sandra Pinion will be cueing.  Our first dance is the first Saturday on the 3rd.  The theme for the dance is &ldquo;Apple Fest&rdquo;.  Our second dance for the month is on the third Friday on the 16th.  The theme for this dance is "Autumn in the Air".  We look forward to dancing with all of our friends this fall.  We are thankful for all who come and visit Tri Squares.
