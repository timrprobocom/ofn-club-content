With a definite sense of fall in the air, the Ramblers are turning our attention to our annual 3-day dance festival, which we call Scares and Squares due to its proximity to Halloween. This year&rsquo;s festival will take place October 23-25 at the Multnomah Arts Center, 7688 SW Capital Highway, Portland, Oregon 97219. This facility is right in the heart of Multnomah Village and has ample parking.
 
This full weekend of dancing starts on Friday night with a trail-in dance starting at 7 pm. We dance all day Saturday, with a hosted buffet dinner, and then dance into the night&mdash;usually with a Halloween costume contest. We conclude with a brunch on Sunday morning, and dancing until 2 pm.
 
We have three top-notch callers joining us this year: Mike DeSisto (with his legendary high-energy calling style), Chris Phillips (who has called all over the US, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany), and Gary Monday (who is one of the most-popular callers at our monthly dances). We offer dancing for all levels from novices to experts, with sessions for class-level Mainstream, full Mainstream, Plus, Advanced, and C1.
 
Historically, we have welcomed dancers from all over the United States, as well as Canada and Europe, for this extravaganza of good dancing, good friends, and good cheer. We would love to see you for part or all of the weekend&mdash;we warmly welcome singles, couples, and families. Casual dress all weekend.

(Note: if you can&rsquo;t come for the whole weekend, we offer separate session pricing. These prices will be posted on our website.)
 
SYIAS!
