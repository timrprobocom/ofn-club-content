The Rogue Squares turned 2 years old August 5, 2017. Our Birthday Dance was a real fun dance. Guest Caller Jim Steele from Bend, OR. was just great. We hope to get him back real soon. Ending the evening with the Grand Spin was top of the cake. That is such a fun way to end the evening anytime. Mary Nutt did a fantastic job of keeping the floor filled with Round Dancing, thank-you Mary.
 
We had a great club meeting August 11, 2017. Some of the Star Promenaders came as guest and we shared ideas and plans for the future to work together on how to bring in and keep students, encourage Angels with fun idea that may include free dances and make this a bigger success with new dancers.
 
The Rogues voted on changing our one dance a month, beginning January 2018, from Third Friday to Second Friday. We'll keep you posted and remind again.
 
See ya at a Club picnic or dance, have fun anyway. Gwen
