It has been a hot summer and found us cancelling a couple of dances, which is a first for us. So we are looking forward to the cooler nights and slightly shorter days in September. This is the back to school month, so we are starting up our mainstream classes September 14th, with Scott Zinser. We will meet every Thursday evening from 7:30 to 9:30 PM.

Another change that occurs in September is the price of our dances going up to $6.00. The cost of our insurance on the Barn jumped up this year significantly, so we are passing the cost along. For Country Cut-Ups members, it will still be an incredible deal.

We want to thank all the dancers who helped us have some great fun at the Boring Barn this summer with the Dan Nordbye/Julie Stiers Father's Day Dance, the July 1st picnic and dance with Jim Hattrick, and the 5th Saturday Surf's Up beach themed dance in July with George and Patty Hermann calling and cueing. These were all well supported by the square dance community and we are grateful! You all make this such a fun place to dance!
