Our Fifth Saturday dance is September 30 at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.  7:30 - Pre-Rounds and 8:00 - Square Dance.  We have had a number of new members join to call and;or cue.  So please come on out and join us.  Air conditioning, cushioned wood floor and FUN!
    The floor at the hall had been refinished in July and is just beautiful.  Todd Jensen's team did a fabulous job.  Many dancers from all of the clubs took turns 'watching the floor dry and cure."  That means we opened up all of the doors and made sure everything was safe and nobody went it.  Actually, neighbors would stop by to see what was going on.  Several of us took opportunities to advertise and recruit. 
    Kirby Goode, CCCA member, remains on 'in home' hospice.  He took a tumble recently and is right now, bedridden.  It's hard but with Kirby's caregiver, Jake Westra, and our square dance family and other friends and family we are handing in there. 
    Sharon Greenman, CCCA members, suffered a heart attack the same day Kirby fell.   She remain in the hospital.  We pray both Kirby and Sharon get strength back and are better soon. 
 
    Keep on dancing and having FUN!
