Beginning September 16 we will be dancing at the Palmer Creek Lodge in Dayton. We will be posting directions to our new venue soon. Meanwhile, we're doing demos at several local events and we also enjoyed summer Festival. Hope your summer was fun-filled and we will enjoy dancing with you at our new location.

Our lessons for new dancers will again be held at the Yamhill Heritage Museum but they will be on Sunday evening beginning Sept. 10. Carmen
