We will welcome the cooler days of fall as summer finally ends.  Do you ever remember so many hot days with so little to no rain?  Now you know square dancers are tough and just keep those feet moving to the calls and the music’s beat.  
 Summer Festival in Salem had around 100 people dancing on the capitol steps which was only fitting since square dancing is Oregon’s State Dance.  Seventeen Eager Beavers were dancing with about 450 dancers from around the state on Saturday night.  The Sunset Promenaders won the attendance award. 
 We decided that we would not wait for Christmas to come but we could think of cool and celebrate Christmas in July.  The challenge was finding Christmas theme clothing to wear in July.  Dancers rose to the occasion turning out in red, green, and gold outfits.  Music was no problem for our caller.  Maybe we were not any cooler but I think we thought we were.
 On September 4th we will dance at the Aloha Grange as Sunset Presbyterian will be closed for Labor Day.  
 The Eager Beavers and the Hoedowners will dance at the Cedar Mill Market on September 9th for an hour starting at 10 am.  
 We dance on most holidays.  Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 to 3:00 pm, at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
