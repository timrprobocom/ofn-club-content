With all this hot weather, Willamette Squares indeed had the perfect theme for their monthly dance the fourth Saturday in July. A great crowd turned out for The Lazy Daisy Days of Summer dance. Everyone was welcome to come casually dressed in summer attire, and with the air-conditioning everyone was comfortable, even though the Salem Square Dance Center did heat up some from all the lively dancing! On the refreshment table there were plenty of finger foods and snacks along with a plentiful supply of drinks for everyone to remain hydrated. 

No matter the weather, Willamette Squares and their guests can always count on having an enjoyable time dancing together! Willamette Squares is looking forward to lessons come fall. In the meantime, do the cool thing and come dance with us!  Jodee Howard
