We had a very tiring week working in the trailer at the Siskiyou Golden Fair, but it was fun as well.

I want to thank all the people who worked in the trailer, we made enough for another year.  YEA!

There were enough dancers to shake a leg at the fair on Saturday night and even had some people in the audience come out and had a great time square dancing.

We will be dancing at our Birthday Dance on Saturday, September 16.  Terry Halley will be calling and Sarge Glidewell will be cueing.  Rounds start at 7:30 with squares at 8PM.  Turning 63 this year.

Our classes will start up on September 11, and will be open 18th & 25th.                             

Looking forward to a new year.
