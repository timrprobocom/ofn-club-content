Even though everyone’s thoughts in August seemed to circle the lunar events on August 21st, it did nothing to eclipse the fun and excitement at the Oaky Doaks’ “Thorns and a Rose” dance on the first Saturday of the month. An interstellar time was had by everyone and it seemed like nothing could cast a shadow on the joyful mood and good times as they danced to the heliacal Callers, KC Curtis, George Herman and Darrel Kalmbach and the celestial Cuer Patty Herman. It was a cosmic event indeed.

As we labor into the month of September, we are reminded that summer has ended. Along with that, it means the end of the best time of the year ever, vacation. That dreaded moment has returned. It’s back to school. 

On Saturday, September 2nd, we will be having our “Back to School” dance where we will be collecting supplies for our neighborhood school, Oak Grove Elementary. Bring a donation of school supplies and get $1.00 off of admission. Have a flash back moment as you enjoy a sack lunch during break. Caller Mark Wheeler and Cuer Tami Helms. Pre-rounds start at 7:00 with Mainstream is from 7:30 to 10:00 with a Plus tip done prior to the 9:00 break. 

Making a stop Saturday, August 19th, as part of their Farewell to Portland Tour will be Make and Helen Halley. Come join us in what may be their last time to call and cue at the Oak Grove Community Center. Pre-rounds start at 7:00 with Mainstream is from 7:30 to 10:00 with a Plus tip done prior to the 9:00 break. 

Hope to see you across the square.
