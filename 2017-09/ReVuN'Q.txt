The club will start Intermediate level Waltz class on Sept. 14. This is for dancers who have had Phase 2 waltz lessons. Our summer has been spent on getting more acquainted with cha cha and rumba as they flow and putting the more difficult steps in place. Each week has been filled with dancing and adding a move or two to make our dancing experience more fulfilling.

A few of us attended the TVC round dance party on July 29. It was a good dance with a good variety of cuers and multiple levels of dancing for all in attendance. 

We send our healing thoughts to Jeanine Norden for her broken pelvis and to Stephanie Lozano for her fractured ankle. Healing wishes for both of you from all of us. Marilyn Schmit
