Summer is here and someone sure turned up the heat!  Although we’ve been dark at Hoppers we have still had lots of dancing around at other clubs. This week it seems many clubs have cancelled due to heat. We still managed to get 3 banners so far this summer. 

We had our annual picnic this last Sunday and shared a great meal and fellowship. Don & Joanne Oja hosted us at their beautiful farm again and the weather was perfect. We had 48 in attendance and our president, Melissa James, set our course for the coming dance year. We kick off on September 2nd with our Back to School Dance. Our new dance format will be in place. PLEASE NOTE 7-7:30 Pre-rounds, 7:30-9:45 Plus. Refreshments and break at 9:45. School supply donations gladly accepted and encouraged. We hope you’ll join us as we dance to the talents of Jim Hattrick at the Clark County Square Dance Center. Bring on the dancing!
