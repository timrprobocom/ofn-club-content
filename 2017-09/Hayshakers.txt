We are in a club of transition.  With our new members, we are making decisions on what night we want to dance, how often, and whether we want to do lessons again in the fall.  We are going to start up dine out so that we can get to know our new members better.  This can be an exciting time. 
 Dale & Kathy Worthington are the newly elected Vice Presidents of the Western Region of USDA.
 Also, we will be putting on the Seaside Sashay, October 27 and 28, in Seaside Oregon.  We are becoming a busy club.
