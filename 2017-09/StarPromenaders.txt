Our club wishes to send a great big thank you to all the dancers that supported 2017 Diamond Lake Festival.  The callers, Eric Henelau and Wayne Weaver were fantastic as expected. There were ten squares dancing at 10:30 on Saturday evening. 

Eric  dived into the lake on Saturday morning during the “Splash in the Lake” session.  He is a great sport.   He brought three squares of dancers with him to Diamond Lake.  And they brought a new board for the dancing floor.

If you have never come to the festival, I encourage you to make it a priority next year.   Hunter Keller will be joined by Wayne Weaver to call, and Mary Ann Callahan will be the cuer.   On Tuesday evenings we invite the spectators to join us as we dance.  Each year we have several non-dancers participating.    Wayne always lets them know that Square Dance lessons start in September all over the country.   Next year’s chairmen are Walt and Darlene Shontz.

We are looking forward to Circle N Squares Birthday Dance in September, and Klamath Falls Potato Festival in October.

Our mainstream lessons will start September 14 and the Rogue Squares begin lessons Sept. 11.  There are also lessons starting in Grants Pass, Yreka, Roseburg and Klamath Falls.  Angels are needed at all these lessons.  But remember, angels are at the lessons to set an example, but we need to let the instructors do the teaching.

Wayne will have A/1 and A/2 workshops in September and start lessons in October.

We celebrated August birthdays and anniversaries at our August 12 dance.  This was a great success both in numbers attending and the ice cream and cake provided.
