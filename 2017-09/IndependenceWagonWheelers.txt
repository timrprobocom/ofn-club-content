31 IWW dancers had a fabulous July 8 visitation to the Aloha Grange. Then many of us joined dancers from other clubs to dance on the Capitol steps on July 14 in a warm-up (on a warm sunny day) for the Summer Festival. The incomparable Crew did their usual superb job calling for us. The Summer Festival at Blanchet Catholic School in Salem was a huge success. Well done and many thanks to the Summer Festival Committee and the many Summer Festival volunteers. 

Our club was dark in August for our usual dances, but as of this writing we are looking forward to our annual fund raiser project of parking cars at the Polk County Fair, and to hosting a demonstration square dance at the Polk County Fairgrounds on August 19 as part of the Upcoming special Eclipse dance. Our Veteransâ€™ Day Dance will be on November 11. Happy dancing! Dee and Bert Mackaman
