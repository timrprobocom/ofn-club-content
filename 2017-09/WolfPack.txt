We had a good turn out for our Summer Dance. Very thankful for our air conditioned hall and enjoying the new finish on the dance floor. Everyone had a great time.
We will have our Annual Picnic at Island Park on August 26. That is always a fun event with friends and family joining us by the river.
We are looking forward to the New Dancer Class starting in September.
Next up is our Back to School Dance on Saturday, September 2nd. We hope you can join us.
