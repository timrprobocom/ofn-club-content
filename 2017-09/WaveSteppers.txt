The Wave Steppers’ Anniversary Dance Saturday, September 9th will be an Elvis Dance, with caller Mark Wheeler as Elvis, and cuer Connie Clark.
 All the club’s dances are held at Garibaldi City Hall (107 6th Street, at Acacia).  About two-thirds of the building’s second floor is a dance floor, built in the 1940s by the Fire Department for the old Firemen’s Balls.
 Garibaldi is on the Oregon Coast, 9 miles north of Tillamook.  About 2/3 of the second story of City Hall is a dance floor, built in the 1940s for the old Firemen’s Balls.  Enter on the Acacia St. (uphill) side, one block off Highway 101 (the main street of town).
