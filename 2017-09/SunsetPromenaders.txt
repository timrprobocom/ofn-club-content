Sunset Promenaders visited The Toe Draggers Club on July 7th celebrating their Annual 4th of July B. B. Q., and dance.  It was a good time and we had 12 Promenaders there.
 The Club went to the Summer Festival in Salem on July 14th & 15th and brought home the Wood Trophy for the Club with the highest percentage of members registered.  
 We had our Club Picnic at Noble Woods Park and had 36-people with lots of food, played Bingo, and socialized.  It was special time including several of our new members but we missed our President and wife who were in North East Montana, and Judy and Floyd were on a trip too.
 Both Mainstream Dances in September (2nd, 16th) the Club will be dark.  On the second we will be doing a visitation to the Valley Squares and on the 16th we will be attending the State Federation Meeting and dance at Kinton Grange.  The Promenaders Plus will have dances September 7th and 21st in our air conditioned with a wood floor hall.  The hall is at 267 E. Main St. Hillsboro time is 7:00 to 9:30.  Extra parking is available across the street at behind the Premier Community Bank.  Please check out our new website at www.sunsetpromenaders.com
