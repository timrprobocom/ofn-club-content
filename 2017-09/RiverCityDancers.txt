We’ve been enjoying a busy and fun summer of dancing. In July a large number of us attended summer festival in Salem . Later that month we enjoyed the wonderful hospitality of the B 'N 'B 's  as we visited them for our visitation. Les Seeley was calling that dance and we had a wonderful time. Thank you B'N'B’s. 

July is also the time when we have our annual campout .Since our usual camp site is now under new ownership , we have been making our camp out a trip to The Diamond Lake festival for the last two years instead. Several members attended and enjoyed it.

Craig Abercrombie has volunteered to teach our lessons in September. They will be at our hall which is Milwaukie Community Center on 42nd and Jackson Street. Lessons start Sunday September 10 at 5:30 PM. 

Friday, June 2nd, Nancy received a heart pacemaker.  So far, she’s not jumping up and down with energy, but hoping it will come soon.  Kaiser wanted her to fill up with my same old green “poison” med, and is just now working it out of her system.  

We are looking forward to our Anniversary Dance, which will be past by the time you read this.  We’re, as always, thankful to our River City Riders who put so much practice and joy into their performances.  

We dance all year every second and third Saturday and warmly welcome all dancers. We would love to share our fun with you.

Thanks to all who have Nancy good wishes and kept Rocky dancing.
