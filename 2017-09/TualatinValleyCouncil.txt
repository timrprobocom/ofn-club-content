IMPORTANT NOTE -- because of temperatures forecast to be in the upper 90s with unhealthy air conditions, the Hahn Barn Dance has been canceled.  We'll let you know if it is rescheduled.

(((Since the OFN is published mid month, you still have time to plan on attending our annual Hahn Farm Potluck and Dance on Sunday, August 27th.  Potluck by the lake begins at 5:30 followed by dancing in the barn from 6:30 to 9:30 PM.  This year our caller is Janienne Alexander with Mark McDonald from Central OR cueing.  In case of high temperatures, we will still hold the dance unless it is over 90 degrees that day, then check the Oregon Federation Facebook or the TVC website for our decision on whether or not we will hold the dance.  Last year, it was about 85 degrees when we started the picnic.  We kept cool at the pond where there was a nice cool breeze and everyone was comfortable.  By the time we went to the barn to dance, the temperature had dropped lower and it was quite pleasant.)))
 Although not a TVC event, all dancers are encouraged to attend the Dance & OFSRDC State Meeting on September 16th &17th at the Kinton Grange.

TVC please bring desserts or finger foods for the break at 10:00 pm.  The following morning, Sunday September 17th, the State meeting will be held.  This weekend is a great opportunity for you to meet with and visit with your Oregon Federation of Square and Round Dance Club officers and delegates from around Oregon.  Our own Kathy Roberts will be installed as Federation President.
 Our next Council event is the Tri-Council Dance on September 30th.  It will be held at the Oak Grove Community Center, 14496 Southeast Cedar Avenue, Oak Grove, OR 97267.
