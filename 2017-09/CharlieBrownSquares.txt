The Charlie's were dark for the month of August due to the County Fair taking over the fairgrounds. We are anxious to get back into the swing of things and start our new classes. Mainstream lessons start Tuesday Sept 12th at 630 - with the 1st 3 classes free.  Chuck Simpkins will be our class instructor.  We will also have a "Dust the Rust Off" workshop to help our angels get back into the swing of things!!
We will be using guest callers & cuers and hope to have lots of visitors who will enjoy the variety of talent we have coming to Grants Pass!!
We will be doing 2 demos at the county fair on Fri Aug 18th & Sat Aug 19th. August 19th is also our club picnic and we look forward to the fun and fellowship that this activity provides to us!  August 26th is party time for 2 members of our square dance family when Phil Ramey & Frances Cloyd tie the knot!! Everyone in the valley is looking forward to a fun nite of dancing with special guest callers and cuers! Who knows who might show up!
We are dark in the month of September as far as club dances go - for Labor Day weekend and in order to travel to Yreka for the Circle N Square birthday dance!
I hope everyone had a great summer and we are hoping for a good size class of new dancers and some great dances happening at the Charlie's and throughout the valley!
Hope to see you in a square soon!!
