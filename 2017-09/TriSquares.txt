The Tigard Grange has been too warm to dance this summer, so in both July and August we’ve been making visitations to other clubs who have air conditioning, and it’s been so much fun! 
 In September our annual Mainstream lessons begin on Sunday afternoons from 3:30-5:30 as always.  This year beforehand we will be adding a Mainstream Workshop from 2:00-3:00 for everyone who wants to brush up on some Mainstream calls. 
 And we’re especially looking forward to our Anniversary Dance on Friday September 22nd, with national caller Adam Christman and cuer Sandra Pinion.  So please come and join us, to “Celebrate Good Times!”
