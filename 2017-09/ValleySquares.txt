Our July 1st Dance was lots of fun.  Scott Zinser was taken aback when a square yelled out enthusiastically after he called, "Bend the Big Line!"  That is one of our favorite calls.  
 We were dark for Summer Festival.  A wonderful time was had by all our members who attended. 
 We had enough people to form a square for our visitation to Toe Draggers Red, White, & Blue Dance & BBQ. KC & Bev found a variety of music to fit the theme.  Darrell Kalmbach joined KC for a number of tips. Decorations and food were impressive.  Now Dan needs to give us the flag we won...
 Please join us for our Back to School Dance September 2nd at Aloha Grange. Scott Zinser is calling & Connie Clark cueing.  We are grateful for any school supplies you might donate. 
 We will be dark September 16 for the Oregon Federation Dance.
