 Tualatin Timber Squares is enjoying a busy summer with our new dancers! We had a lovely time at Summer Festival in Salem.  We have had guest callers Mike Sikorsky and Michael Halley, we danced in parades, and have been out visiting other clubs!  Our dancers earned their dangles for broom partner, balloon between the knees, mummify the caller and wait… what?!  Dancing in the women’s bathroom?!  Yep, that’s right!  We promenaded squares in and out of the women’s bathroom, doing a couple of figures while we were in there and sashaying our way out.  We had giggles all around that night!
 We will be hosting a trophy dance in the next month or two as soon as we can find a location to have a BBQ and outdoor dance.  Any suggestions?  Keep your eyes open for a flyer!
