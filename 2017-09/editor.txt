<p>As we begin&nbsp;another square dance year, we face a number of challenges. &nbsp;There will be some spirited discussions in the next year or so regarding the future of the Federation's two annual festivals. &nbsp;If you have opinions, please find a way to express them. &nbsp;If your club is one of the many about to begin lessons, remember that those new students represent the future of our activity. &nbsp;The rest of us can't keep dancing forever.</p>
