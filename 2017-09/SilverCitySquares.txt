Hi all - we're back! We are kicking off September with our dance on September 8. This is going to be an Island Pie Night. Decorations will be along the lines of a tropical island and we will be having a set break time downstairs for a variety of pies with ice cream.
Our lessons start on Tuesday September 12 and we are hopeful for a good sized class this year. Last season Thomas ended up having to cancel his lessons as we just couldn't get consistent students and he kept having to go back over the first couple of lessons.

Mom is working hard on finalizing Silverton High as the location for the teen festival as I write this. The new principal is interested in making it work out. 

We had fun at the Homer Davenport Parade on August 5. Leonard Snodgrass always does a great job with a parade. We had a full square on the trailer plus a few more to trade in and out. We also had a couple of walkers who were handing out lesson flyers.

See you at a dance soon!  Petrina Buchheit
