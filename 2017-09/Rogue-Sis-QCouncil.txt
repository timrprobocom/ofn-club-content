Hi Everyone,
Well, summer is still here. It doesn't seems to be as bad as a couple of weeks ago, but high 70's and low 80's is SO uch better. We must remember these sunny days this winter when it is raining and the snow is falling and everyone wishes for more sunshine. We are in a place where there are 4 seasons.

Don't forget the Council dance Friday, September 29th. The council is excited to have Scott Zinser calling & Elaine Funk cueing our next council dance Fruitdale Grange. How exciting.  Should be a great time for everyone, including your newer dancers.  Don't forget to support the Council and the Clubs in the Rogue Valley. The next Council meeting will be October 2, 2017 at Denny's Restaurant on Biddle Road at 4:30pm. There are are still "Learn to Square Dance t-shirts available. We have quite a few 2x's and have found that the t-shirts are a great conversation starter.

Summer Festival committee has been working hard to bring excitement and fun next year, June 21-24, 2018. If you have any questions about summer festival or the council contact Lorri McIntosh at nursylady1976@yahoo.com 
The council went together with Rogue Sis Q Callers and Cuers to advertise new square dance classes starting in September on the Grants Pass transit system. We should know in October how successful the advertising was.
The council is excited to have a new caller, Jean Brown AND a new cuer Rikki Lobato.  Look for their names and help support the new kids on the block.
Lois & Lorri
