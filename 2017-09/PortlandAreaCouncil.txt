We suggest you take some of the new dance classes offered, as it supports lessons and indirectly new dancers.  If you don't know a cloverleaf from a Track Two, you could probably use refresher dance lessons.  And if you don't know a Walk Out Two from a Travelling Scissors, it's probably time for a round dance refresher.
