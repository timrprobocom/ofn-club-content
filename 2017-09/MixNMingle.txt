Since this is being written in July, it won't be as current in September, but it will still be current.  Jeanine Norden, our much appreciated cuer, fell over their largest dog, breaking her pelvis in two places. When she is ready to leave the hospital, she will spend four weeks or so in rehab.  Tami Helms will cue the first dance in August, while Dennis Smith will cue the second dance for us.  We will go dark the first Saturday in September.  We will have news on our website for information after that.
 However, there is another issue to write about:  wearing fragrances and perfumes.  Although this subject has been covered before, it has been quite a while.  Jeanine has found that along with other dancers, she is extremely sensitive to scents (you could say that she is "scentsitive"), and being exposed to the scents could result in coughing and the loss of her voice.  It will be most appreciated if attendees could avoid the uses of fragranced products in order to help protect Jeanine's lungs and provide a comfortable environment for her and others with this sensitivity.
