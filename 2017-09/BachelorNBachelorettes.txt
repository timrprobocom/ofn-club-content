Jul 12 was among our most successful dances. Those silly guys! They told me it was a wet T-Shirt dance, so I dutifully donned my T-Shirt and went into the shower. When I got out I put on some other things, got my snacks, and headed off to the dance. What saved my modesty was that it was so hot that day, my shirt had completely dried by the time I got to the dance!

Aug 2 was so hot we cancelled.  It was the only time we cancelled a Wednesday in recent history.

Our lessons start this month, and we may have the cheapest lessons in town!  Imagine:  $3 person, $5 couple, $8 family.  Okay, Iâ€™ll tell our secret: The caller is Glenn Hauskins, who is volunteering his time.  He does so much for the club, little wonder he's president.
