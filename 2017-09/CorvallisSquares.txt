We're grateful to all those who helped put on a successful Summer Festival. What a special weekend it was.

Looking to recruit for fall lessons, Cynthia from our club has planned a couple of demo dances to raise awareness and show how fun square dancing is. We danced at the Benton County Fair in extremely warm conditions. Many thanks to Sandy Harris for calling! We plan to dance at the Corvallis Farmer's Market in September. Our club is planning a potluck and meeting to reconnect and gear up for the fall.

Our mainstream lessons will be on Monday evenings, the first one being Sept. 25 at 7:00 p.m. with Bruce Lowther as our wonderful instructor!  We look forward to kicking off the dance season on Sept. 9 with our regular dance! Karen
