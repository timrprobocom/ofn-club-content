July was a wonderful dance month for the Hoedowners.  On July 8th we hosted our Hawaiian Luau Dance.  Which is your favorite Hawaiian island?  In a very unscientific poll, Hoedowners seem to prefer Maui, at least in 2017.  Daryl’s back has been troubling him so while he recovered we were fortunate to have Randy Dibble call for us.  We also had a guest caller and cuer; George and Patty Herman.  The Oregon weather did its best to set a tropical tone as the weather crept into the 90’s.  So glad we have air conditioning as we had 75 guests for the evening.  A huge shout out to the Independence Wagon Wheelers who brought 30 dancers to fill the floor.  We love seeing all those sequined wagon wheels glittering on the floor. 
 July 22nd was our Floatin’ Away Dance was our traditional root beer float dance.  Thank heavens we were prepared for the 90 degree weather with cooling treats.  Les Seeley graciously filled in for Daryl while Randy Lewis cued the entire evening.  
 July 29th was Dance Under the Stars in McMinnville. A wonderful dance we try to attend every year.  For various reasons, we only had a square this year.
 September is looming ahead as the store shelves are stocked with pencils, tablets and backpacks.  You know what that means, our September 8th Back to School Sock Hop.  Remember to bring school supplies or lunch box treats to donate.
 Don’t forget our New Dancer Class begins Wednesday, September 13th at 7 pm.  Please invite those who are interested in finding out a bit about square dancing or want to brush up on the mainstream moves.
 Some of our members will be joining the Eager Beavers for a square dance demo at the Beaverton Farmers Market on September 9th.  We hope to generate interest in our lessons while we entertain the visitors.
 September 23rd is our Farmer’s Market Dance where we’ll celebrate the harvest and dine on fresh produce from the garden.
