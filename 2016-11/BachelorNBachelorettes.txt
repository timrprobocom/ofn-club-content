What a great visitation we had from the River City Dancers on Sept 21.  While we have one of the better attended club dances around, we don’t get official visitations all that often.  (Yes, the visiting banners are getting a bit dusty in our hall.)  So, we especially welcomed the RCD group.  We also note that it’s unusual for a club to be able to get the support to visit all council clubs each year, as the RCD’s do.  For that reason, we gave them BOTH their banners back as they won’t be able to return for another year.

Rumor has it we will be getting another official visitation in October.
