Our first dance in September was on the 17th of the month and it was a "Root Beer Float" dance. We had over three squares, with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  Lots of fun!  
Lessons started on Sunday night the 18th with ChaCha classes at 5:00 PM and Mainstream classes at 6:30 PM. There were lots of angels attending both the sessions.  First lesson is FREE and we are hoping we will have a square of students.  

Our first dance of October was a great dance. We are planning our "Black Light" dance for the 15th of the month. Our club also attended the Pirate Dance at the Albany Timber Twirlers and we will be joining the Corvallis Squares for their Halloween Dance on October 22. Both the Pirate Dance and the Halloween Dance are dances that we support as a part of our valley Alliance.  We always have a great time. See you all in a square!  Marilyn York
