Happy November to all. At this point we are well into the new year of dancing and we have had some fun. For our first 3 dances we have had open "community" dance parties with nice turn outs. We have gained some new students for our beginners class from the open dances. We will restart our regular dances in November.  We will be having a "Giving thanks" dance on 11/19/16 where we are asking those who attend to bring a donation for seniors living in local assisted living facilities. Some badly needed items are shampoo and cream rinse, soap, lotion, deodorant, socks with gripper bottoms, lap blankets, large print word search and cross word books, puzzles, calendars, and stationary. We have done this dance for the last 2 years and I am always humbled by the gratitude from the activities director and the residents. 

Our beginners class is going strong. It meets on Sunday from 6-8pm at the Hazel Dell Grange. We dance the first and third Saturdays at the Hazel Dell Grange with pre - rounds at 7:30 and main stream at 8pm. Hope to see you in a square.
