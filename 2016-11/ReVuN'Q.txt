As I write this, tomorrow is October 1 and the club has finished the first month of Foxtrot class/workshops. We had no new students so we are working on various tricky moves in the phase 3-4 variations, and also workshopping moves and adding new dances to our list of dances we already know how to dance. Come join us. There is lots of room on the dance floor. 
On the first Thursday of October and November we will be just dancing with no workshopping. We will preview our demo for Mid-Winter and start working on learning the dance. We need to look good, you know.
We will have a Christmas dance in December and we are going to start putting plans together for our New Yearâ€™s Eve dance, and figuring out another rhythm to work on in January.  Got any suggestions that you would like to share with us? Marilyn Schmit
