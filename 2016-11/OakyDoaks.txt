At the October 1st dance the Oaky Doaks did something for the first time that may become an annual event. Dancing and Bingo. During the shifts between squares and rounds the Bingo team of Susan, John and Gary entertained our visitors from the B and B’s by calling five Bingo numbers. Players then looked over the cards they had and prizes were given to the winners.

The next weekend, October 7th - 9th, we were off to Sun Lodge for our annual retreat. Members engaged in games, puzzles, walks, and lots of socializing. The big event for the weekend was the Play-Doh masterpiece which was won by the winning team of Robben, Linda S. and Jeanette. The Men’s Evening Snoring Contest was won hands down by Gary who not only had his roommates move to another room but was also heard by the ladies in their rooms.

On October 15th the club had a howling good time with several of the members getting into the spirit of the month by getting dressed up in costumes. All enjoying the spooky calling and haunting cueing of Mike and Helen Halley.

November finds the club gearing up to hold the trophy dance on Saturday, November 5th. Everyone knows how to win but just to remind everyone and to fill in the new dancers the club that shows up with the highest percentage of their members get to take the trophy home. Now you smaller clubs don’t let the bigger ones scare you away. The winner is determined by the number of dancers who show and the number of members you have in your club.

On the third Saturday, November 19th, the club will be gathering together for their Turkey Trot Dine and Dance with a crock pot casserole cook-off. Thankful for all the fun we have had together with all of the other square dancers who we visited and all of those who visited us. 

We wish everyone a safe and Happy Thanksgiving.
