Fall is continuing to be busy here at the buckaroo Barn. Lessons are going well and we have plans underway for some student level dances coming up in the next month. Our first dance this month was a tribute to Minnie Pearl. We had quite the collection of hats that evening in the barn! Everyone had a great time…even if we had to explain who Minnie Pearl was to our younger members!
Our second dance this month was our costume party dance. We had a everything from monsters to princesses show up to dance the night away. We also had a bunch of Buckeroos who were able to help the Buccaneers and the Sets in Order celebrate their anniversaries….50th for the Buccaneers and 70th for the Sets in Order!
We are gearing up for the holidays and getting ready for our largest fund raiser of the year! If you are in the area, or plan a trip this way, let us know and we can set aside a beautiful wreath to adorn your home this holiday season. Stay tuned for dates and prices.

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
