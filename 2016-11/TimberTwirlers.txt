We had our “Talk Like a Pirate Dance” and, as usual, we had a very good turnout. Our caller Bruce Lowther always finds some music appropriate to the theme and really dresses the part. I (cuer) also found some good pirate rounds. It was a lot of fun. We had a lot of dancers dressed as Pirates and Wenches which added to the enjoyment.  Come join us for all of our fun dances.
