Our new dancer’s class is off to a great start.  We have 17 new dancers and they are having a wonderful time of learning.
As a club we have two extra special activities planned for the month of November. Our second Saturday night dance will be a Veterans Day dance on November 12.  We will admit all veterans to that dance free of charge as a token of appreciation for their service.  Our caller and guest cuer (Patty Hermann) will be using music through the decades for this dance.  

We also have the honor of hosting the first New Dancer’s Dance of this season for the new dancers of the Mid-Willamette Area clubs. Happy Dancing!  Linda Neuschwander
