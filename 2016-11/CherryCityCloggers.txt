With the advent of Fall, we have started another beginnerâ€™s class.  We have had a fairly good response with about 17 new people very excited about learning the art of clogging.  We have also drawn our demo season to a close with the exception of accepting an invitation to clog on the steps of the Oregon Capitol for the Oregon Bounty Celebration which took place October 8.  We are now in the process of nominating and electing officers for the upcoming year. Georganne Pfnister
