We had a visitation to the Tualatin Timber Squares this month.  What a fun group of people!  We hope that other dancers will check them out.  Janienne Alexander is the caller and founder of the club.  They dance at on second and fourth Wednesdays at Winona Grange, where M'nM’s dance on first and third Saturdays.
 We miss our friend Susan Corbett, who so often danced with us.  She was tall and beautiful, with a winning smile.  We appreciate her bequest to promote square dancing in Oregon. 
 November 5th we will have our 32nd Birthday Dance, complete with cake and ice cream.  Lindie will have the usual jars of M&Ms (NOT M'nM’s) filled with the candies for people to guess how many to a jar.  We aren't celebrating the famous British reason for celebrating November 5, Guy Fawkes Day.  
 It is that time of year again to begin stocking up on nonperishable goods for our food barrel.  Long ago we collected teddy bears for the police station and the fire department.  Eventually they had more than they needed, and other clubs were donating those.  We felt that a Canned Food Dance was more needed.  Since the grange has a barrel for collecting food for the Oregon Food Bank, the grange will deliver it, another plus for us.
