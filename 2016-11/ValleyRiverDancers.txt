The Valley River Dancers want you to remember two words for November: GOSPEL DANCE!  The day after Thanksgiving, Randy and Julie spin old-time Christian classics to kick off the holiday season. Please join us for pre-plus at 7:30 with mainstream and rounds at 8:00. 

Our October "5th Saturday" advanced dance will be held the 29th at The Estates Auditorium in Woodburn starting at 7 pm. 

We have been enjoying teaching mainstream to our students at 6:30 every Tuesday. We workshop Advanced starting at 8:00, and these old dogs learn something new every week!  All A dancers are welcome to join us. 

And, last but not least, it isn't too early to plan your New Year's Eve. We will be dancing plus (with every third tip advanced) at the Maplewood Grange. Please join us as we welcome 2017 with a dance and a toast!  Perrin Damon
