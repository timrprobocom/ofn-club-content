<p>As we enter into our 3rd year of the online OFN, I do want to express my thanks to all of the area editors and club helpers around the state. &nbsp;You're all doing a great job of getting your information in accurately and on time.</p>
<p>There does seem to be some confusion about the "Special Dance" section of the OFN. &nbsp;If I allowed people to do it themselves, by simple human nature, every dance would be a special dance. &nbsp;So, I have reserved that for me. &nbsp;If you want a dance listed as a "Special Dance", you need to enter it as regular dance, just like you would any other dance. &nbsp;Upload the flyer, and then drop me an email, telling me which dance it is. &nbsp;I then have a special administrative site where I can mark dances as "special". &nbsp;That's all it takes.</p>
