The Charlie's have been busy with new classes and are glad to be back dancing​ ​
!!  Beginner classes have closed until January, and we have about 12 new students. We are hopeful they will be bit by the dancing bug!! A-1 class is holding steady on Thursday​​, with a solid group enjoying themselves!
We have 2 dances in November. The 1st Saturday dance is ​our ​Dance For Freedom​ on November 5th​, with Ray calling & special gues​t cuer Sarge Glidewell from Klamath Falls. Our 3rd Saturday dance is our Turn Your Bad Day Upside Down dance on November 19th, with special guest caller Jim Steele from Prineville.  There will not be any rounds during this dance; we will have Advanced starting at 7:30pm, followed by alternating dance levels. We are also gearing up for our 49th birthday dance on December 3rd, with special guest caller Richard Lane and cuer Bob Dingman. Check out the flyer for all the details.
Our October dances were lots of fun; with a Stone Soup Dance on Oct 1st and on the 15th we had guest caller J Domis join us for a fun nite at our Cake Walk The Plank Dance!!
The Boatnik Committee have also been busy planning for a wonderful festival Memorial weekend with Hunter Keller & Randy Lewis as our featured caller and cuer.  We hope to see many of our friends at our upcoming dances.
