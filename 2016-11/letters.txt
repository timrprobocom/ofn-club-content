<li><a>Pine Forest Grange in Bend Holds Community Support Dance</a>
<div>
<p><a href="content/2016-11/FoodBank.jpg"><img style="float: left;" src="content/2016-11/FoodBank300.png" /></a></p>
<p>On Friday, September 30 the Pine Forest Grange in Bend put on its first annual&nbsp;Community Support Square Dance. Randy Dibble was the caller and Ken Pratt was the&nbsp;cuer. Randy&rsquo;s calling was both wonderfully entertaining as well as challenging, and&nbsp;Ken&rsquo;s great cuing consistently filled the floor with enthusiastic round dancers.</p>
<p>There was no admission charge for this dance. Instead, dancers were encouraged to&nbsp;support two local charities, Bethlehem Inn, a homeless shelter in Bend, and Neighbor&nbsp;Impact, which provides food and other services throughout Central Oregon.</p>
<p>Dancers had been provided a list from Neighbor Impact of the most needed food items&nbsp;and encouraged to bring a bag of groceries in lieu of the normal dance admission charge. &nbsp;By the end of the evening there was a large collection of grocery bags stuffed with food.</p>
<p>A representative of Bethlehem Inn spoke briefly during the dance, describing work they&nbsp;do to provide assistance to the homeless community in Central Oregon. Dancersresponded with very generous cash contributions to Bethlehem Inn.</p>
<p>Not only did Randy Dibble call a great dance, but he was also instrumental in generating&nbsp;enthusiastic participation in Split the Pot ticket sales. All proceeds from Split the Pot&nbsp;were given to the two charities.</p>
<p>The Pine Forest Grange would like to thank all of the dancers who attended this dance for&nbsp;their great generosity. Their support exceeded all expectations. Plans are now underway&nbsp;for the second annual Community Support Dance sometime next year.</p>
