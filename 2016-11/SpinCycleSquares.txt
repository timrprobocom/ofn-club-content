    A number of our members attended the Women's Dance Retreat in Garibaldi recently.  The dance floor is wood and a joy to dance on.  The hotel is right across the street with a breakfast buffet that rivals expensive hotels' fares.  The hotel has food out for later as well.  This venue is also used for round dance weekends that Kirby and I used to attend..  Hopefully, I'll get to attend the women's retreat next fall.  Sounds like too much fun to pass up.
    We do have a few new dancers learning with us at 5:30.  With so many angels learning is quick and painless.  It's FUN to show the "newbies" how much FUN we have each week.
    We are dark October 16 as that's Cast-A-Shadow's and Spin Cycle Squares special Advanced and Challenge day from 3:00 - 8:30 with a meal in between.  We are also dark October 30.
    Remember, November 19 we have Kris Jensen, national caller from Albuquerque calling a special dance   3:00 - 4:30 will be Advanced and Mainstream and Plus from 5:30 - 8:00.  $7 for each session.  We'll have our famous Silent Auction during this dance as well.   This is a Saturday so we will not be dancing November 20.  A potluck will happen between the two sessions.  We are famous for our potlucks.  This dance will be held in Hall B in the back of the hall.
    We dance each Sunday from 5:30 - 8:00.  All levels.  Tim Matteson does a great job of teaching and calling.  We are gradually increasing in numbers.  Casual dress and smiles!  Come and join us!
 
Happy dancing,
