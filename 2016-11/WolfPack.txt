The Wolf Pack started off the month on October 1st with a fun Fall Dance assisted by our friends, the Boots & Sandals. If you werenâ€™t here, you missed a great dance. There was certainly a lot of really good food. Thanks to everyone for their contribution.

Our next dance is a Harvest Dance on November 5th with the new dancers invited. Hope you can make it.

Lessons with Sandy Harris teaching, are going well on Tuesday nights. We can always use a few more angels. Come meet the new dancers and join in on the fun.
