We had a wonderful dance month in September with Jim Hattrick calling and Jackie Gale cueing at our first dance, and in addition to Craig Abercrombie and Al Frazier doing their 50s plus fling songs now and then at our second dance of the month. There were a few period outfits that helped with the mood. We had lots of guests and a really good time at both dances.

In November we have three dances, a regular mainstream dance with Jim Hattrick on November 11th (Friday), and the second on November 16th (Wednesday) for our new dancers - a Basic 51 dance with Sandy Harris calling from 7 pm to 9 pm at the ESDC Hall. Our last dance is November 25th - a Civil War Tailgate Party, the day after Thanksgiving. Girls Night Out is calling and Jackie Gale is cueing.  Everyone who is staying close to home will have a great time coming to this dance and exercising off the extra pounds from the festivities you attended or created with family and friends. We hope to see you on the dance floor, whichever dance you can attend, and we especially encourage you to join our B-51 new dancers and angels if you can.
