Valley Squares is dark the first Saturday for Royal Romp.  Please join us third Saturday where the lovely Renee Ruud is our guest caller & Connie Clark the cuer. 
 We began Our Mastering Mainstream lessons with teacher Darrell Kalmbach.  He is excellent and is working not only muscle memory but our brains with All Position and Dance by Definition.  You can still join us on Tuesday nights at Aloha Grange.  
Thanks to the loyal club members who joined our visitations to Rosetown Ramblers & Tualatin Timber Squares & thanks to those clubs for their warm hospitality.  
 The barbecued chicken at our Tailgate Dance was yummy and Daryl Clendenin & Connie kept us hopping to work off the calories.
 Thanks to all the generous folks who donated abundant supplies to local schools at our Back to School Dance.
