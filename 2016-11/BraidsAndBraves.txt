September brought us back together as a club after a summer break. We started on Friday evening with a visit to the Toe Draggers for their anniversary dance and brought home one of their banners! They are cordially invited to come retrieve it, too. What a big dance that was! 
Saturday was busy with a demo at a local Rehab facility and a great potluck before our regular second Saturday dance. We had lots of fun dancing together again and dared Leonard Snodgrass, our caller, to wear a black and silver petticoat, which he bravely did to call several tips. His photo was even posted on Facebook!  Our friends and former club members from California, Chuck and Trena Worthington, came to the dance, too!

 Our Square Dance classes have just begun on Thursday nights and our cuer Sandra Pinion is teaching Cha. We look forward to lots more square dancing fun!  Carmen
