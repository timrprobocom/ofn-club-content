Willamette Squares has had a busy month. We did a demo dance and provided the staff of Youth with a Mission some square dance lessons at their fall conference in South Salem. We then held our annual Oktoberfest dance with a German flair and plenty of sausages and sauerkraut on the refreshment table. Lessons on Sunday night at the Salem Square Dance Center could use a few more angels if anyone out there would like to volunteer to help. 

Willamette Squares would like to remind everyone of a few upcoming changes. We will be going dark on the fourth Saturday of October, which is our regular square dance time at the Salem Square Dance Center, and in its place will be our birthday dance the next day on Sunday, October 23 at 1:30. 

We will also be going dark on the fourth Saturday of December which is the 24th, but not all is lost because on January 8, 2017 at 1:30 will be our New Dancer dance. Then the fourth Saturday of January 2017, January 28, Willamette Squares will be dark because of Mid-Winter. We hope to see you all at our birthday and new dancer dances.
