Go into stores now and see all of the Christmas decorations being displayed.  Wait!! It isn't even Thanksgiving yet.  But with Thanksgiving comes some of the best square dancing in the area.  Eat all of your turkey and zone out with Thanksgiving Day football and then on Saturday, November 26th The Columbia River Dancers will host national caller Dan Nordbye with Julie Stiers cuing... our first annual "Turkey Burn-off Dance"!  We expect the Hazel Dell Grange will be rocking. Plus dancing will be from 7 to 8 and mainstream from 8-9:45 with rounds in between tips and goodies and fellowship after.  If you are a mainstream newbee, or a single we encourage you to come. Our club works hard to ensure that everyone has a good time dancing.
 On the 11th of November we pause to honor our veterans and on the 12th our very own Jim Hattrick will be calling and cueing for your dancing pleasure.
 September was very, very quiet for the club but the members themselves were very active.  We danced at the Fair, we danced in Olympia with the Do-si-dos, watched the Horses dance and attended meeting about square dancing.  We were dark the 4th weekend as the cloggers took over the Hazel Dell Grange and rocked the hall.
 We have started our lessons this week.  Thanks to all of our angels and to Jim Hattrick's teaching style, our students really looked good.
