 We are glad that everyone is ready to dance again.  Our 5th Friday Plus dance in September was very well attended. Thanks to Daryl Kalmbach for calling.  We all had a great time.
We had a Mystery Trip scheduled for October 15. There will be more information about that event in a later issue. 
We are dancing our Regular schedule the month of November with our first and third Friday Dances.  December 2 is our NEW DANCER DANCE so do come on out and support all the new dancers in our area.  Randy is busy with a class of 15+ for this session.  See you all on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
