   We will have a Halloween Dance October 29.  Pre-Rounds are at 7:30 and squares at 8:00. We have a number of newer callers and cuers who will be calling and cueing for you along with the "oldies".  Dance is held in Hall A at the Emerald Dance Center, 2095 Yolanda in Springfield.  Cushioned wood floor.  Costumes encouraged. 
    We have an all women board this year.  Linda Putzler - President, Sandy Eddings - Vice-president, Christina Corelli - Secretary, Gail Jackson - Treasurer.  We thank Sharon Greenman who held the treasurer's position since Pat Hintz passed away.  Gail Jackson has worked with the bank to help save us money.  Good job gals!
    CCCA dances the Fifth Saturdays.  Sometimes this coincides with major holidays though.   i.e. Memorial Day when a lot of dancers are doing other things. 
    We encourage you to come out and dance with us on a Fifth Saturday.
 
Keep on dancing!
Christina Corelli
Secretary
