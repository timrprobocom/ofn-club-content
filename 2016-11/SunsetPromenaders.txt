40 Club members and guests enjoyed the Club Beach Campout at Devils Lake Resort at Lincoln City.  The weather was amazing with blue skies and warm temperatures with sun.  At night we had blazing campfires, we did a poker run during the day Saturday, and there was a lot of visiting, laughing, and great food.  Overall it was a great time with friends, and we did some dancing, too.
 The Club visited the Toe Dragger Anniversary Dance where there was a full hall of dancers from around area.  The break included many berry good treats; the hall was beautifully decorated for the festive occasion.
 Several Sunset Promenaders visited the Tri Squares on their Anniversary Dance and danced to caller Dan Nordbye from Arizona.  Dan did a very good job of calling and Sandra Pinion did a good job cueing.
 Our Club cuer Ken Pratt is having intermediate round workshop including an introduction to Jive on Sundays from 6:30 to 8:00 at the Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall.
