Sept 10, many of us went to the Washington State Fair in Puyallup, to go to the Flash Mob.  Afterwards, we went to visit the Do-Si-Dos at the Lac-A-Do hall in Olympia.  These consortium dance halls seem to be an anachronism from the past, and the only one in the Portland area will likely pass out of our control soon.  But in some places, such as Olympia, they still seem to thrive, giving member clubs a guaranteed place to dance.  (In most larger cities, real estate prices preclude dance halls unless there is a consortium dance hall. or unless alcohol is served.)
