First time to our club?  Let us know at the door.  We have a special dangle just for you!
 The Tualatin Timber Squares were seen all over Oregon and Washington in September.  Our club members love to dance as often as they can!  On September 10th we participated in possibly the largest Square Dance Flash Mob ever at the Washington State Fair!  600+ dancers from Washington, Oregon and Canada.  What a great day to promote square dancing.
 Mystery Caller!  On October 12th we had a Mystery Caller scheduled to come to our dance to do a guest tip.  Not the whole dance.  Just one tip.  We won’t tell you which tip or who the person is.  The Mystery Caller is a national caller and coming right off the airplane and straight to our dance!  You might never get another chance to dance to this person as this is off their normal circuit.  So don’t kick yourself for missing out.  Come on over and enjoy a great dance and some wonderful chili and cornbread!
 Clubs be on the alert.  There is a roving gang of Banner Bandits out to steal your banner!  Oakey Doaks were hit at their Beatles dance.  Toe Draggers were hit at their Anniversary dance.  Are you next?
 Ugly Christmas Sweater/Skirt dance - December 14th.  Now is the time to start hitting the thrift stores or the deep recesses of your closet.  We will have prizes and food and fun dancing!
