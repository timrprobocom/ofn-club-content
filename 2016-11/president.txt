<p>As November approaches, it will be time to think of holidays that are coming and how far along your classes have come. Does your club invite the class members to a holiday dance and get them acquainted with more club members and show them what fun they can have during a regular dance? That same fun can happen at class if the club members are involved as angels, party planners for short notice happenings, etc</p>
<p>With winter coming, how far from home will you travel to support your club or another club in the area? How much does weather dictate your dancing activities?</p>
<p>As of the printing of this article, I will have attended a function in four of the ten councils in the Federation. Six more to visit, attending Mid-Winter, Summer Festival, and going to Cincinnati to play and represent Oregon at&nbsp; the national convention. Once all that traveling is done, I will have earned my second Federation Traveller bar. How many of you venture all over the state to dance and make new friends? Try it and find out how rewarding it can be. The clubs you visit will remember how you took time out of your schedule to support their event.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving and go dance off the pounds you gained.</p>
