Our lessons started up in the beginning of the month, so that is nice.
 Our youth had their workshop/dance followed by their overnight party. The kids had a blast at the party. Mom (Karyn Buchheit) had made a huge "Twister" mat and we played that for a couple of hours. We also learned some line dances and played some board games. We did dance two tips during the party.
 
Those who came to our September dance were treated to pie and ice cream. We also danced downstairs in the basement.
 
Our November dance is a "Storybook" theme. We are encouraging people to come dressed as their favorite story or nursery rhyme character. We are also having a ham dinner before the dance (we are cooking one of "the three little pigs"). Please come join us for some fun. Petrina Buchheit
