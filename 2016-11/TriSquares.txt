Can you believe it’s already November?  The Tri Squares has been enjoying their new students during lessons. We’re about halfway through with our B-51 lessons.  We would love to see your students and angels at our B-51 dance.  The theme is a Cowboy Country!  The dance will be held on December 10th.  The dance format is 7:30 - 7:45 PM rounds, 7:45 - 8:00 PM plus and 8:00 - 10:00 PM B-51.  Every fourth tip will be plus.
 We recently had our 18th Anniversary Dance during the month of September!  We had a great time dancing with our friends.  Our entertainment for the evening was National Caller Dan Nordbye and Cuer Sandra Pinion.  There were 90 people in attendance at our dance.  A big thank you to everyone who came to our dance!  Our visitors made this dance a very special night.
 We now dance on the Second Saturday and Fourth Friday of every month.  Our Caller is Terry Halley and our Cuer is Sandra Pinion.  We look forward to seeing you at one of our dances.
