IMPORTANT:  Our dance time changed.  Dancing will begin at 1:00 pm and end at 3:00 with a short meeting for announcements at around 2:30. 
 “Fall Back” on November 6 when DST ends. You do not want to arrive too early and wonder why nobody is there. 
 Our visitation to Toe Draggers was enjoyed by the square that attended.  There were too many choices that night and we could not be everywhere at the same time.  Many thanks to Toe Draggers and our members who attended. 
 We have several members are planning to attend Royal Romp the first weekend in November.  This is always a special dance and if you have not been there and you want a challenging plus dance, be sure to go this year.  
 November has my favorite holiday, Thanksgiving.  This is the month I am reminded of all the wonderful experiences I have had with family and friends.  I am so lucky to be alive and enjoying the natural world in all its diversity.  We will have a Dine-Out October 31st at the Golden Crown on Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway in anticipation of Thanksgiving.  Sign up sheet will be at dance.
 We dance on most holidays.  Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 - 3:00 p.m., at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
