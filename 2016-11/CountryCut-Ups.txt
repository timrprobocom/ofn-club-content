There is a chill in the air and Christmas decorations are already popping up in stores. Where does the year go? It has been a busy year at the Boring Barn and it is not over yet! September brought us a nice crop of students for our mainstream lessons which are ongoing. October harvested some nice community connections with some more demos, so we are hoping to keep some momentum going.

In September, several in our club participated in the Mob Squad square dance at the Washington state fair. We were trying to break a record for the largest flash mob square dance event. We ended the day with a dance with the Do-Si-Do Club at Lac-A-Do Hall in Olympia, dancing to the calling of Jim Hattrick. It was a fun day. Then, we had a visitation at the Hoedowners and heard Daryl and Yvonne Clendenin calling and cueing. In October, we will visit the B&Bâ€™s in Oregon City.

October 1st, we celebrated our 56th anniversary dance for the Country Cut-Ups with Craig Abercrombie calling and Julie Stiers cueing. Preparations are underway for the Annual Ham, Eggs, and Pancake Breakfast and Bazaar. We are thankful for all who attend that and help us raise money to keep our Barn maintained. We will close October with a fifth Saturday dance, all plus level dancing with a Halloween theme on the 29th. Terry Halley will be calling and Debbie Coombs with be cueing. Hope you can join us for that.
