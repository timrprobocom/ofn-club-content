We held two dances in August at the Emerald Square Dance Center in Springfield.  The first was our Hawaiian Luau Dance with Jim Hattrick calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  This dance is always fun as many will dig out their Hawaiian garb and come relaxed and casual for this event (lots of leis but no hula skirts this year).  We were happy to see some guests form north of us join us as well as many Whirl-A-Ways out on the floor. 

Our second dance was called by Terry Halley and cued by Jackie Gale.  We thank Terry for driving so far to call for us with his fine baritone voice.  We heard about Bill Gale’s upcoming neck surgery and found out that he came through it all right.  We hope he will be out of pain.  This was the last dance of the year for us but it was good to host square dances for the many dancers whose clubs for dark for the summer.

We are looking forward to seeing how everyone responds to our new dance format starting in September.  We will no longer have a formal sit down break but will dance straight through 7:30PM to 10:00PM with announcements and clean up at 10PM with a half an hour of plus followed by mainstream.

On the fourth Saturday in August the Boots N Sandals held their final dance with Lennie Ludiker calling.  Some Single Trees were there to say good-bye to this fun club and remember the good old days dancing in their barn in Cottage Grove.  They had a good ru n but losing their barn was a hard blow.  Dancing at our hall in Springfield just wasn’t the same.   We’ll miss you, Boots!

Keep on dancing and supporting one another,
