Although we are a Washington club we are also a member of the Oregon Federation.  We have recently changed our Council affiliation in Washington from the Sou'wester Council  to the Evergreen Council, a little closer to home and our regular dancers. 
 R Square D had a fun dancing summer.  We have been pleased with our air conditioning, having mostly 4 squares on the floor at each of our dances during the summer.  We are back to regular dance times as of September.  REMEMBER Second Friday, Fourth Saturday, till next June.
