Last summer the weather was blistering hot and the club was forced to cancel some dances and many lessons.  This year we decided to be ahead of the weather and go dark for July and August.  The result of this decision was that the club was able to visit other clubs, get some of our banners back and take some banners.  It also allowed the club to plan get-to-gathers before visiting other clubs and enjoy each others company.  We also had a lady's day get together and a club picnic.  Lessons continued to be held and new dancers came at the beginning of each month.  All in all a very productive summer.
 October will be another hit and miss month.  By that we will be dancing at the Hazel Dell Grange on the 12th with Mark Wheeler calling and Julie Stiers cueing.  We will be calling this our Halloween Dance so put on something goofy as we all will have fun.  The fourth Saturday (October 26th) is the same weekend as the Seaside Sashay.  As in the past we will have a large club group in Seaside and there will be NO DANCE at the Grange.
 Did you know square dancing has been our "Official National Folk Dance" since President Reagan signed an act of Congress in 1982.
