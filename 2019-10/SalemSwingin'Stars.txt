By the time you read this we will be nearly into Fall.  Wow, where has this year gone ?

Salem Swingin' Stars has had many great dances with dancers from all over the area in attendance.  Our 5th Friday Plus Dance in August had five squares on the floor!

Mainstream lessons started on September 11 and will continue through mid January. There is also a Plus Workshop after the Mainstream lessons led by Randy Dibble.

Our Annual Corn 'n Cluck Dance on September 20 was another fantastic dance with great food and of course, that Crazy Chicken. October brings us two regular dances which will be tons of fun. See you all on the Dance Floor.
