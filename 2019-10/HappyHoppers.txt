After two successful summer dances, the rainy the fall season arrived in September, and the Hoppers were back in the swing of things with our regular dance format.  We celebrated a “Back to School” dance where school supplies were collected for a local elementary school and a “Johnny Appleseed Dance” featuring all apple desserts for our break.  Yum!  We were especially pleased to have a great turnout of new and returning students when lessons resumed on September 9th.  In addition to Jim Hattrick’s terrific teaching skills, we are blessed with a large number of club members who act as angels to help and encourage new dancers.   The energy level and enthusiasm during lessons make the evening fun for everyone.

	Now we are looking forward to October activities. Considering the amazing cooks we have in our club, our October 19th “Harvest Days” dance featuring all pumpkin desserts should be an outstanding treat for members and guests. In addition to our own dances, a number of Hopper members have traditionally attended two fun filled weekend events:  the Octoberfest put on by R Square D and The Seaside Sashay.  Each weekend has its own special flavor, but both embody the spirit of square dancing:  fun, fellowship, and dance.  We’re looking forward to seeing you in a square somewhere.
