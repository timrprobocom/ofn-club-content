Wolf Pack had a very nice Picnic and Memorial in August for our founder and past caller Larry Dupray; he will be sorely missed.  We have lots of fun dances planned and maybe a few changes.  Keep watching for news.  We dance the first and 4th Saturday of the month.  Please make plans to join us for fun dances.  We could really use your support.
