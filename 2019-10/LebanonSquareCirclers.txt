Labor Day Weekend at Frank and Marianne Cawrse's farm was a glorious event for many square dancers who came with their RVS and tents. There were potlucks every night, lots of fun and games and dancing with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing from the top of the silo.  What fun!
Our club started mainstream lessons on Sunday, September 15 at 6:30  PM at the IOOF Hall in Lebanon.  Charlotte Jeskey is the instructor. 

Our club will have a regular dance on October 5 and our annual Black Light dance on the 19th.  We always love to have visitors. See you in a square!
