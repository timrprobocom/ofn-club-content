Both of our scheduled dances in August were cancelled.  The first one was because only five people showed up, and the second was because it was 97 degrees that night.  The Winona Grange's air conditioning does not work that well with outside temperatures that high.
 Our next scheduled dances are on October 9th and October 23rd.
 Our club continues to be a fun place where friends gather, have some food and practice moves they want to work on before the weekend dances.  Lots of belly laughs to go around. We would love to have you come join us! 
 See you around in a square....
