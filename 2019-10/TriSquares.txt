The summer heat kept our club dark for August but we visited both the Sunset Promenaders and the Hoedowners and had a great time.  In between we held a “dance-demo” at the Tigard Library on a Saturday afternoon.  The library publicized the event on line, and 22 people attended, expressing interest in our upcoming lessons.  Also 21 of our 27 Tri Squares members showed up to angel and make it fun! 
 The final Sunday we had our traditional annual summer’s end potluck picnic on the shady hill at Snyder Park in Sherwood.  We enjoyed the wonderful music  from the acoustic guitar of Charles McAuley and the accordion of Adolph Eppich. 
 In October we’ll be busy with lessons in Mainstream and Two-Step and go visit Mix ‘n Mingle for their 35th anniversary dance. 
 NOTE: We will begin OUR NEW DANCE SCHEDULE on the 2nd and 4th Fridays of the month.
 Come join us on Friday October 11th for our “Fall Fling” and then on Friday October 25th for “Come As You Aren’t”,  which is our Halloween dance.  Both dances with our caller, Terry Halley and our cuer, Sandra Pinion.
 We also are having a New Dancer Jamboree on Sunday October 20th, class level up to B-30, from 3:30 to 5:30.
 See you on Fridays from now on!
