The calling of Daryl Clendenin and the cueing of Connie Clark kept everyone entertained at the TVC Dance on August 31st.  The TVC Banner was won by the Valley Squares for having the highest percentage of their membership in attendance.
 Our next Council event is a fifth Saturday Dance, held at the Aloha Grange on November 30th.  This dance will feature Mike and Julie Stout calling and cueing.  The dance begins with pre-rounds at 7:30 followed by Mainstream with rounds at 8:00.  Every third tip will be Plus.  This dance is co-hosted our brand new club to the TVC, the Oak Hills Squares.
