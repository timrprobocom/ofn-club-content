Weâ€™ve only a square of new dancers in our classes.  Regardless of that, our club is strong with a central core of dedicated dancers.  Also interesting is that most of our new applicants this year have had prior experience with square dancing, and several coming to us from other established clubs.

Effective immediately, our standard dance donation for members will drop to $5, and remain at $6 for non-members.  The board feels this will give an encouragement for more of our regular visitors to become members.  Pending members are always treated as regular members until they are voted on, so if they fill out an application form, they too will get in for $5.

Our Sept 15th inter-club picnic went well.  Essentially, we rented the pavilion and the stage at the End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center.  Frankly, it cost us a bundle but we had a barrel of fun!  Other than dancing each week and a monthly visitation, the club does few activities, so this was something different for us.  A little more than two squares turned out (mostly visitors), so we had a square in the pavilion and a square on the stage.  We entertained several passers-by.  We need to give a big thanks to Scott Zinser for donating his caller services to this event.

In spite of the cost of renting out this park, our club is financially well.  By reducing our door donation to $5 we are among the lowest of requested donations from dancers.
