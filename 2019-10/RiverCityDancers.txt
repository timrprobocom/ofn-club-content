River City Dancers we’re out in large numbers doing visitations to Country Cut Ups and the PAC dance in August. We also brought two squares to the State Federation Dance on September 7. We love visitations. If you bring a visitation to us, we will come visit you. 

We began our lessons for new and returning dancers on Sunday September 8. We are happy with how many attended and how well they are doing. We are offering the first EIGHT lessons free on Sunday evenings at 6 PM at our hall at the Milwaukie Community Center where we dance in Milwaukie at 42nd and Jackson.

We dance every second and third Saturday and our first dance each month is a theme dance. Our September 14 dance will be a Disney Dance where many of us will dress in costume. The October theme dance will focus on Fall Harvest.
On October 6, our cuer Couple Tami Helms and Tim Keck will offer two step round dance lessons from 3-5 PM at our hall. Also in October, we will be lending our support for breast cancer research at OHSU by attending the “Are You Man Enough to Wear Pink?” dance for the cure dance at Kinton Grange sponsored by Toe Draggers club.  This is also on Sunday October 6 and is from 1:30 -4:30. PM.
