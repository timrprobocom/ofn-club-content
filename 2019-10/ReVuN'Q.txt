Even though this article is for the October issue of the OFN, I am writing about September activities. 

On Sept. 5, the club had a party night with requests before we started our fall season of dancing on Sept. 12. We reverted to the schedule as follows: 6:30-7:15 p.m. is review of previously learned rhythms; 7:15-7:45 p.m. is floor time dancing; 7:45-8:30 p.m. is Rumba class and 8:30-9:30 p.m. is for the higher level dancers with 4+ and 5. There is something for everyone.

Our club is co-host for the Mid-Willamette Area council Fall Festival that is being held in Woodburn on September 29 from 1:30-4:30. Golden Squares are the other co-hosts. Ice cream will be served with pie or root beer. Come join us for some fun and good eats for a Sunday afternoon. Marilyn Schmit
