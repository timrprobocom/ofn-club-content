With summer on its way out, we look forward to our regular schedule again.  That includes our delayed Root Beer Float Dance September 21st.
 Big news is that October 19th is our 35th Birthday Dance!  At 7:00 Randy Dibble will call half an hour of plus, followed by Sherri Clark cuing half an hour of round dancing.  After dancing mainstream from 8:00 to 10:00 we will head downstairs for chocolate cake (probably decorated with M&Ms by Dan Knierim) and ice cream.  Lindie might even have some more ideas for this special  evening.
