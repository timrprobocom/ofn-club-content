Diamond Lake Festival is really in the record books this time. The weather was good and not too many mosquitoes; at least as long as there was a breeze blowing. We are all looking forward to Diamond Lake Festival in 2020. We will have a real "TRIFECTA" and a bonus of three callers of National Status. We will have Mike Sikorsky, Michael Kellogg & Mike Haworth, with a bonus of Rikki Lobato as featured cuer.

The next "Game Night" will tentatively be October 11, with a theme of "Mexican" to celebrate the game most of us play. It is a "Hoot." If you don't play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on. We are open to most any table game. 

The Stars "Club Picnic" was on September 8. Wayne & Debbi extended an invitation to all for the use of their home for the event. Thank you, Wayne & Debbi! Phil cooked some awesome burgers & hot dogs.

Phil Ramey started a new "Plus" class on Monday, September 9th from 630-830pm. There were two squares turned out to either learn plus or brush up. Everyone had a great time.

Classes started on Thursday, September 12. There were 10 new students the first night with a couple of "reboots." There is also the promise of more new ones to come. Remember - The 1st 5 lessons are "Free."
