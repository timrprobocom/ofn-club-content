The council does not have any dances until January, The Pajamarama Dance.  More information on where, when, and who will be calling in October.  We encourage the dancers to support our local clubs with multiple birthday dances scheduled.  Several will be visiting the Circle N Squares Birthday Dance on September 21 with Eric Henerlau calling and Rikki Lobato cueing.  The next birthday dance for this council is Charlie Brown Squares in December.
The council benefit weekend for Beachcombers raised $916.00 for their much needed repairs on their roof.  We want to thank everyone who came and supported the weekend.
Our next council meeting will be October 1 at 4:30pm, Round Table Pizza in Medford.

Respectfully Submitted,
