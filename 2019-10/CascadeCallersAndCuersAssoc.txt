Our next scheduled dance is November 30 at the dance center in Springfield.  The members of CCCA will call and cue a fun dance for you! The floor in our hall is cushioned and so nice to dance on.  We also have new ElectroVoice speakers purchased from Dan Nordbye.  The speakers work well.

Keep on calling and cueing for fun,
Christina Corelli
