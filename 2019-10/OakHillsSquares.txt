Our mailing address in the TVC Directory is correct (2085 153rd), but we dance at the community gym, which is located two blocks north of that address (2400 NW 153rd and Oak Hills Dr.).  Sorry for any confusion this might have caused.
 On August 19th, we graduated six new dancers from our new-dancers’ class.  Fun, silly dancing, and games were followed by snacks and celebration.
 We welcome Renee Ruud as our caller for the third and fifth Mondays beginning on September 30th.
 Come visit TVC’s newest club on any Monday evening.  Square dance attire is optional.  On the first Monday of the month square dance attire is encouraged, and the dance will be all singing calls.
 Thanks,
  Marie Clem
