As I write this, we're looking ahead to our mainstream lessons starting on October 2 and we're hoping for a good-sized class. This fall weâ€™re once again partnering with Linn-Benton Community College and the class will be held at the Benton Center in Corvallis, with Bruce Lowther instructing. Our dance season started on Sept. 14 with a free, all-comers dance to introduce folks to square and line dancing. Our hope is that it will attract folks to the joy of square dancing! We're grateful to be able to continue dancing on the second and fourth Saturdays at the hall at the Congregational church with its lovely wood floor. We're having our yearly Halloween dance on October 26 and it will be a fun and festive time! Happy Autumn everyone! Karen
