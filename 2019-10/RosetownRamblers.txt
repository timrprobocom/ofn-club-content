The Ramblers kicked off another series of lessons with Free Tastes of Square Dancing on August 28 and September 4 at the Bridgeport United Church of Christ in NE Portland. We have an enthusiastic group of students and look forward to sharing the joys of square dancing with them!
 
After our summer break, we resumed our monthly dances with Kris Jensen calling on September 14. Kris always does a great job with creative choreography—and she’s so patient when we can’t seem to remember our right from our left.
 
Our next monthly dance will be October 12, with Richard Lane calling. Our monthly dances are at the Oak Grove Community Center, 14496 SE Cedar Ave., in Oak Grove. We alternate Mainstream and Plus tips from 7:30 to 9:30 pm. Everyone is welcome!
 
It’s not too late to get in on one of the finest events of the Portland area square dance year. We’ll be hosting our three-day dance weekend October 25-27 at the Multnomah Arts Center in Multnomah Village. In addition to hours and hours of dancing at all levels from Basic through C-2 (we have two different dance halls all day Saturday), we’ll feed you a picnic dinner on Friday night, a catered Thai buffet on Saturday night, and Sunday brunch. And we have our always entertaining costume contest on Saturday night. We are expecting dancers from Seattle, Vancouver BC, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago, and ????.  If you love to dance and love to meet new people, this is the extravaganza for you! You can find more information on our webpage www.rosetownramblers.com.
