The Chaps and Petticoats were one shy of a square at the Beachcombers weekend dance (August 30-Sept. 2nd) in Port Orford.  The weather was perfect for dancing-in-the-surf Saturday morning.  The men’s pie making totaled twenty (20) pies created Saturday afternoon, potluck was fabulous and KC Curtis & Dave Cooper put their hearts into some good “raising the roof” fun.  The party continued Sunday with Terry Halley (caller) and Cathy Houston in a duet on stage:  Terry sang while Cathy cued.  The Beachcomber’s 20th annual Battle Rock Festival hosted 31 RV’s and nine (9) squares dancing Friday through Saturday and six (6) squares Sunday.  Approximately $3,000 was received in donations (pie auction attributed $1,000) to aid in a new roof for the hall.  Congratulations!

What a way to open our dancing season - with a Trail’s End Dance (to the State meetings) on September 6th - Scott Zinser, Caller Advisor to PAC, called and Dave Cooper cued.  PAC’s President, Keith Miles, was in attendance as were other PAC Delegates and Representatives.  Four squares enjoyed dancing and Cooper shared stories of Scott Zinser’s early years in square dance, including his T-shirt that hangs in the Beachcombers hall in lieu of a visitation banner.   

We are very much in need of Angels to host our ladies taking Cha-cha lessons that began on September 15th (4-5:30pm) at the Maplewood Grange.  Angels dance for free, each Sunday; please come and help our students learn.  

Our 1st and 3rd Friday dances in October feature:  Scott Zinser and Tami Helms on the October 4th “Pirate” dance (be there or walk-the-plank) and Darrell Kalmback and Connie Clark on October 18th.  Scott Zinser and Leonard Snodgrass will call/cuer the Chaps dance on November 1st - please join us.  Chaps and Petticoats will be DARK on November 15th.

Happy Feet!
