title: New Youth Coordinator
---
Howdy all. I am Thomas Buchheit and I am the 2019-2020 Youth Activities
Coordinator. I realize that I may not be well know to everyone throughout
the state, so I thought I would take this time to introduce myself and
explain what my plans are as the Youth Coordinator for this year.

I started square dancing when I about 11 years old and have been dancing
since. I will admit that when I started, I did not enjoy square dancing;
in fact, it wasn't until I attended my first Mid-Winter Festival in 2010
that I started to like the activity. There were several reasons why I
did not initially enjoy the activity, but that is for another article
some other time. Since taking lessons, I have also taken round dance
lessons and have learned how to call. My home club is with the Silver
City Squares, where I have also been an active participant with the
Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival.

One goal that I would like to accomplish as the youth advisor is to go
and visit the clubs in Oregon that have youth members. In order to make
sure that I do not miss anybody, I ask the clubs with youth members that
would like me to visit them to contact me. This way, I can personally
visit and talk with the youth members, parents and guardians, or officers
and try to answer any questions you may have.

title: Dancer Safety

Safety -- this is a 2-part article.  This month is about personal safety as a dancer. Next month will be about safety in and around our dance halls.

### Part 1: Defensive Dancing

We have a tendency to forget that square dancing, round dancing and clogging
are social activities in which we have traditionally welcomed anyone and
everyone to. At one time our "advertising" was "word of
mouth", where a club member was inviting someone they knew to come
learn to dance. We still do that, but now we also have advertising that goes
out to the general public. We no longer have the assurance that each person
coming in is previously well-know by someone in square dance, round dance
or clogging world.

We have all experienced at some time a dancer who is too rough, won't
listen or pay attention to a request to not twirl or who might make us
feel uncomfortable. We don't have to put up with any of this. We also
need to make sure that we are teaching our new dancers about what to do
in situations that they might encounter.

The first step is to get rid of the idea that "we can't say anything --
they might not come back". If you don't deal with a problem dancer --
you will lose other dancers or new dancers.

The next step in any of these situations is to not be afraid to speak
up. Let people know that if something is said, a situation will be dealt
with. If your club doesn't already have someone designated who is willing
and able to deal with problems -- get someone designated. It used to be
the club sheriff who did this as a part of their duties, but it can be
a club officer, the caller or cuer or any club member who is not afraid
to let someone know that they are either not being considerate or even
way over the line. Make sure that all of your club members know who is
your club's designated person for dealing with problems.

Teach your club members and new dancers how to deal with a problem on the dance floor as it happens. Here are some possibilities for dealing with some things. There are others.

Moves or dancing:

* You can't twirl or spin. This can be because you don't want to or you get dizzy or you lose your balance. It doesn't matter why -- no one has to know details.
* You can't raise your arm fully for some moves. If you don't already know how, ask someone to teach you how to "tap and go" with the move. This also works very well if your partner is shorter than you are and has to go under your arm.
* You aren't able to or comfortable doing the "arm around" or "Highland Fling" style dosado.
* Someone is holding a hand too tightly or is extra rough.

As a dancer:

* State to your square that you can't twirl or spin.
* Wear a badge that states "No Twirling", "No Spinning", "Please don't swing" or any other combination. This can be a hard badge you have purchased, or it can be a discardable stick on note.
* If someone tries to twirl or spin you, pull your hands down or out of theirs. Instead of swinging, turn around to promenade position. It can be very hard to twirl or swing or spin someone who is not cooperating.
* Respect the request of other dancers to not twirl/spin/swing. Look for and obey the badges if they are wearing them -- they are wearing them for a reason.
* Learn "tap and go" and be willing to use it with certain moves.
* Keep your arms down or behind your back. Do the dosado by definition.
* Ask the person to not hold hand tight. Show them how to hold your hand properly for move -- they might not know it.
* If it continues -- be louder with request. It won't hurt for the entire square to hear.
* Complain.

As a club

* If your club can afford it and is willing -- have a couple of the hard badges made up to keep at the door and available to be loaned out for the evening.
* Hard Badge examples: "Please Do Not Twirl/Spin/Twist"; "Please Do Not Raise My Arms".
* Otherwise, keep a supply of the "Hi, My Name is&hellip;" stick on name tags that dancers can use to write on and wear as notice.
* Be willing to support anyone who asks for your help with another dancer.
* Help teach others how to deal with a situation. Encourage club members and visitors to help make the dancing enjoyable for everyone -- even if that means you can't do your favorite swing for a tip.

As a caller or cuer:

* As you are teaching lessons -- add how to deal with situations as you are teaching a move that might include or cause a situation.

That was the stuff easy to deal with. Now comes the harder things -- someone does something dancing that makes you "uncomfortable".

* Hands in the wrong places or verbal comments.

As a dancer:

* Ask the offender to stop.
* Physically move the "wandering" hand to the proper position.
* State that you found the comment offensive.
* Complain to a club officer.

As a club:

* Deal with any complaint. Don't brush it off.
* Remember that you can ask someone to leave the dance for the night.
* You can also choose to "ban" a dancer from your club's dances/lessons if they do not choose to behave properly towards other dancers. This would need to be a decision made at a club meeting with the agreement of at least a majority of your club members.
* As a caller or cuer:
* Make sure you know who a problem or complaint should go to for each club you are calling or cueing for.
* Report anything given to you immediately to the designated person for the club.
* As a youth dancer
* Follow school field trip rules. Most youth will know these, which are simple and can help prevent problems.
* Don't wander by yourself -- have a "buddy" (another youth that you know well) go with you.
* Stay inside the building.
* Make sure your parent/guardian knows where you will be at all times.
* Be visible -- don't hide in a corner.
* Don't go off with any adult unless you have permission from your parent/guardian to go with them.
* If something happens that has made you uncomfortable -- tell your parent/guardian or another adult you trust immediately.
* Scream.

Our goal should be to have dancing be fun and enjoyable for all in attendance.
