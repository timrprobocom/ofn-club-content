We had the opportunity to dance in Hall B at the Emerald square Dance Center three times in August.  Dan Nordbye called for us once and we got to dance to him yet again before he takes off for his winter schedule down in Texas and Mesa, AZ.  We ae so lucky that he will drive down from Candy for call for us as it is such fun to dance to a live caller rather than recordings.  However, our coordinator Fred Beise does a great job of choosing excellent material which he downloads from the Internet with the callersâ€™ permission. 

We would love to have more advanced dancers come join us for a Sunday afternoon of fun dancing.  We have quite ofen had two squares of dancers on the floor but on occasion we have been short one or two dancers.  We have lots of experienced dancers to help fairly new people bring up their skills to b e able to dance at festivals and conventions where advanced is offered.

We dance at least twice a month, Sunday afternoons from 1:30 to 3:30 in Hall B (backside of the building) at 2095 Yolanda Ave., Springfield OR.  Please check our website at CAS-SD.yolasite.com or call (541) 741-4149 to make sure we are dancing.  At times we have had to cancel our dances because not enough people were able to come.
