Willamette Squares has had a busy summer with its themed dances: Baseball for June, Summer Fun for July, & Watermelon for August. We are looking forward to our September dance on the fourth Saturday, which will be Oktoberfest themed. You wonâ€™t want to miss weaving the colorful ribbons in a pattern around the Maypole! Our birthday dance, which marks our Silver Anniversary, will be taking place in October, and our New Dancer dance, which includes a used clothing sale, will be the first of December. Be sure to take note of these upcoming dances!  (There will be no regular Willamette Squares dance in January due to Mid-Winter Festival.) We are going on a visitation to Braids & Braves in McMinnville the third Saturday on Sept. 21. 

As far as lessons go, after much discussion, we decided we could be most effective by supporting Independence Wagon Wheelers in their efforts to provide square dance lessons at the Salem Hospital. We will make ourselves available as angels and promote the lessons as best we can. The lessons will take place on Sunday evenings from 6:00 to 8:00 PM. We hope by combining our efforts we can have a larger impact on those who want to learn to square dance.

On a personal note, Willamette Squares president, John Templin, will again be returning to Arizona for the winter months. Willamette Squares will carry on, but we will miss his presence with us.
