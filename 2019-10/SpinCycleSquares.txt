Saturday, November 23 is our NOVEMBER DANCE THINGIE with national caller, Kris Jensen from Albuquerque calling for us.  3:00 - 4:30 will be Advanced - $7 for this dance.  We'll have our famous potluck from 4:30 - 5:30 and then a Mainstream/Plus Dance from 5:30 - 8:00; there will be a door charge of $7 for this dance also. This dance is NOT Sunday.  This dance will be held on a Saturday.  We'll have our awesome silent auction as well.  There are always wonderful items on which to bid.

We will be dark Sunday, November 24. 

We dance almost every Sunday at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.  5:30 - 8:00.  We dance all levels.  Our caller, Tim Matteson, will adjust the levels according to who shows up to come and dance.  It's always FUN, and we always have a lot of FOOD!  We encourage all square dancers to join us!  The floor is cushioned and comfortable! We even have heat and air conditioning!

Please call Tim at 541-988-0399 or David at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are dancing.  We are dark once in a blue moon, but we'd hate to miss you. 

Keep on dancing,
Christina Corelli
