October brings our 59th Club Anniversary to be celebrated at the first Saturday dance. We will be sharing garden produce for door prizes and having pie and ice cream at break. Craig Abercrombie will be calling and cueing that dance. We are working on some pictures to display the history of our club for that event.

On October 20th, we have our Ham, Egg, Pancake Breakfast and Bazaar fund raiser. The square dance community is always great about supporting this and we hope this year is no exception. Come enjoy some breakfast and see what the crafty Cut-Ups have made to offer at the bazaar this year. There will be raffles also. 

We will be dancing as usual on the 4th Saturday for anyone not making it to the Seaside Sashay. It will be our Halloween Black Light Dance, so come dance to Scott Zinser and Tami Helms for a spooky evening party!
