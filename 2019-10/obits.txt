Betty Hanna, 1932 - 2019

We've lost a beautiful, caring and sweet lady, Betty Hanna.     Betty
and her late husband, Ray, taught rounds for many year from beginners
through advanced. They also taught couples in their home where they
had a beautiful dance floor.   Their round dance club was called River
Bottom Rounders where a number of future cuers learned and danced.
David Vomocil and Kathy Baumhardt, Christina Corelli and Kirby Goode
and others learned and danced with them.   Betty and Ray cued for Timber
Twirlers square dance club and the Linn Wanderers.   Ray and Betty wrote
a Christmas dance called A Christmas Waltz and also an intermediate rumba
titled Verida Tropicale.   Their dancers became lifelong friends who
adored them both.   They, in turn, loved all of us.   We were blessed
and are saddened that they are both gone.   We have wonderful memories
to buoy us.   So many round dancers remember them both with fondness
and love.

Ray and Betty were charter members of Oregon Round Dance Teachers
Association (ORDTA).   Betty was their second secretary.   Elaine Funk
is the last remaining founding member of this organization.   There are
but a few charter members left.

Betty and Ray were on the round dance committee for the 1994 national
convention in Portland.   Steve and Ginger Weir and the Hannas worked
on this committee.   Steve and Ginger learned rounds at the Hanna's home
and became fast friends enjoying vacationing together.

Betty and Ray enjoyed hosting potlucks for the River Bottom Rounders
and their home and the homes of their dancers.   There were a fun-loving
couple, and we all remember them so fondly.   Rest in peace Betty and Ray
Hanna.   Your influence and love carries on, and we thank you so much!
