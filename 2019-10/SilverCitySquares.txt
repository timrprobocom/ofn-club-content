We joined other dancers at the State Fair for the youth time slot and we had about 30 dancers there. We are back dancing as of September, so please come see us.

Thomas Buchheit of our club is now Oregon Federation Youth Advisor and Mom (Karyn Buchheit) is now State President. So our family is very busy with meetings. 

Lessons started at the end of September for us as we are trying a later starting date to see if that works better in bringing in students. See you at a dance soon.
