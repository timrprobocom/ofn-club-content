The heat has finally begun to subside, and fall is beginning to show its beautiful colors here in the Umpqua Valley. 

Our first dance of the month was our Back To School Dance. We had our new club caller Mark Wheeler on the stage, and Neil Koozer cued for the round dancers. We had a nice turnout and everyone had a great time! Mark brings lots of energy to the barn!

Our second dance was our Welcome Fall Dance. It is always fun to dance to a fall themed dance when the fall has brought cooler weather and rain. Mark Wheeler called the squares and Neil Koozer cued the rounds.

The Buckeroos began a new set of lessons this month. We had a good number of students show up and are excited to see the energy in the group. We are already looking forward to dancing with them at Mid-Winter!  Speaking of Mid-Winter, we will have Buckeroo Round-Up ribbons for sale, so do not forget to find us and get yours! 

Rememberâ€¦ we are just a short drive south from the Portland area, so plan to join us in the near future. We dance the first and third Saturdays and always enjoy having visitors. We have members of all ages and are a family friendly club.

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
