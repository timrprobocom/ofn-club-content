Just because Hoedowners love bling and a chance to dress up we had our Roaring Twenties Dance on August 10th.  There were several great costumes, guys in suspenders, black shirts, spats and hats.  While the ladies were flappers with fringe, sequins, boas, headbands, and long beads.  It was a Gatsby gala evening with Randy Dibble on the microphone putting us through our paces.  Randy Lewis cued the dance.  We had guests from Tri-Squares, Sunset Promenaders, Valley Squares, Happy Hoppers, Toe Draggers and Oak Hills Prairie Stompers.
 On the 24th we had our Summers End Dance.  Boy I hate even typing those words.  Ken Pratt cued the dance for us. We want to thank the 27 guests who joined us on the floor.  We adjourned to the dining room and enjoyed the fruits of the summer.
 We will be holding a Sock Hop dance; a blast from the 50’s and 60’s on October 12th.
 On October 26 we’ll be dark as we head west, toward the setting sun and the Seaside Sashay.  The convention center in Seaside has had a major remodel the Hoedowners will be there to break it in.
