The Toe Draggers are busy making all the delicious berry deserts for our 44th Berry Good Anniversary dance, on September 20. We hope you are planning on attending.
It’s not too late to get all your friends who have been yearning to learn how to square dance, to our lessons.  Starting Wednesday September 18th from 7:00-9:00pm, and then again on Saturday September 21st from 10:00-12:00 noon.  We’ll keep these times open for at least 2 weeks, so come on out!
Oct. 4th is a regular dance for us.
Sunday, October 6th from 1:30-4:30 is our annual Pink dance. This very special dance is one not to be missed!  We will again have baskets to raffle filled with all sorts of goodies.  We will also be raffling off the beautiful quilt the Toe’s have put together.  Best of all, all the proceeds from EVERYTHING go to cancer research! 
Toe’s will be dark on Oct. 18th, as the Brookhaven Bazaar takes over our hall, and the Toe’s will be having a mystery trip.
We look forward to seeing you real soon.
Kathy D.
