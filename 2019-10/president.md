Hello to Oregon from your new OFSRDC President.

I am looking forward to this year.

My goal for this year is to have all clubs, councils and experienced dancers recruit and support all of Oregon’s new dancers and Oregon’s youth dancers.

New dancers and youth are our future for without them our activity will eventually fade away due to lack of numbers. We need to bring them in to our lessons and clubs, help them learn, support them at lessons, new dancer dances, festivals and as recent graduates. We need to mentor them and help them to get out to visit other clubs and attend festivals-even if this means we have to take a little of our time and effort and reach out to them.

I challenge every experienced dancer to do their very best to bring a new student to lessons this year; to act as a mentor to a new dancer or a youth dancer; to offer to pick someone up and drive them to a lesson or a regular club dance or to a visitation. Encourage new dancers and youth to attend a festival, offer to meet up with them there and help them find their way around.  Help fill out a square so that others can dance, don’t leave it up to someone else.

Please join me in supporting our new dancers and youth, they are our future and our lifeblood for without them our favorite activity will eventually fade away.
