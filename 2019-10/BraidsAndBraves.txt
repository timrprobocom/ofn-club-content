September was National Square Dance month.  School is back in session and clubs are offering square and round dance classes. Braids and Braves will be dancing on the third Saturday at McMinnville Grange on Old Sheridan Rd. Visitors are always welcome. Turn over a new leaf and go square dancing. Carmen
