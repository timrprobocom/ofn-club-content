Greetings from Yreka.
       I want to send thoughts, prayers and well wishes to Annie, Roger and Don and hope you will too. They have all been with our club for a very long time but health issues are preventing them from dancing much. They are certainly missed.
        We have 2 squares on Monday nights. Some of which, are returning dancers wanting to get back into dancing. The returning dancers are guiding new dancers along, we hope all will stay with us for a very long time and help us build our membership back up.
       October begins a new dance year for us. We have started planning dance themes and programs. As we start off a new year we are also making some changes. We hope most of you know by now we no longer dance at Greenhorn Grange, it looks like Evergreen Elementary School will be our new venue. In an effort to attract dancers to our party nights, and an attempt to conflict less with other clubs, starting in October and continuing until further notice we will now be dancing on 3RD FRIDAY NIGHTS. At this time the only month we will NOT dance on FRIDAY NIGHT will be November. Look for fliers and more info. about our dances. Also as we start our new dance year we are looking for a Round Dance Cuer. We believe our party nights are not complete with out one. So if there is a cuer, experienced or otherwise, please feel free to contact us. We are open to ANY one who might be interested in cueing. Round or Line dances or a combination of both would be OK, but we lean toward Rounds. Thank you for supporting our club. Hope to see you on the floor. Dean
