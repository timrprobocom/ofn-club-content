Valley Squares August 17th dance was lots of fun even if we had only 6 couples.  Because we were all Plus dancers, we danced Plus for the whole evening.  We did a 6 couple tip which was extremely fun.  Scott Zinser was our caller, Connie Clark our cuer.  Scott and Connie kept us moving and having fun.  
 Our October 19th dance theme is "Spooky Dance", dress up, it adds to the fun!  Craig Abercrombie calling, Connie Clark cueing.  Our dance format is 7-8:30 pm MS or floor level, 8:30-9:30 pm Plus (or, if everyone attending is Plus we dance Plus the entire evening).  Sometimes we go past 9:30 pm depending upon what our dancers want to do, we work together to have a fun evening.
 We hope more dancers come to our dances to support Valley Squares.  If not, we may have to close down our dance in a few months.  I know most clubs are shrinking, square dancing is diminishing.  We all need to work together to keep square dancing alive, to bring in new dancers, fill our class floor with new students, keep our clubs alive and having so much fun.  A full dance floor is so much fun for the dancers as well as the caller and cuer.
