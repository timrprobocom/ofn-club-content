The September classes have started; and we had a great turnout!! Approx 20 new dancers. The last open date was Sept 19th.  An enthusiastic group of younger dancers, mixed in with all ages!! What fun!  Our only dance in September, featured the duo of Phil Ramey & Sarge Glidewell; not a big turnout - but lots of fun!  We were dark for Circle N Square birthday dance featuring Eric Henerlau & Rikki Lobato - and I am sure it was a great time!!!  We also attended the Rogue Valley Rendezvous with a great group of callers & national cuer!! What a great weekend all-around!!
We, again, only have 1 Saturday dance in October; as we will be going dark the 3rd Saturday in support of the Potato Festival in Klamath Falls. Our October 5th dance will be Mainstream/Plus with Chuck Simpkins & Sarge Glidewell. This is our "Happiness Is A Warm Puppy" dance; and it will kick off Coats For Kids donations and we are also asking for donations for Rogue Valley Human Society.  
November & December dances are a full schedule -with special guest callers J Domis, Mike Sikorsky, Mike Haworth & Richard Lane - what a line-up to end the year!!! 
Don't forget to get your Boatnik Ribbons; preregistering gets you a discount. Flyers have been printed & are being distributed!!
See you in a Square!!
