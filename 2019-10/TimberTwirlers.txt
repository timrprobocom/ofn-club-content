A new season of dancing is now underway. We have lots of fun dances in store for you, starting with our Pirate Dance Oct. 4. You donâ€™t want to miss that one!  Costumes are encouraged. 

Oct 18 is our Cupcakes and Bling dance so wear your brightest and blingiest clothes and eat lots of great cupcakes. Hope to see you at one of our fun dances soon.
