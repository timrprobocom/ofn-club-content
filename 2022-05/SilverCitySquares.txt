We have 29 students in Mainstream lessons, only two of them are adults. Lessons are going well and we usually have six squares on the floor thanks to angels who fill out the squares.

Our Teen Square Up weekend is May 6 and 7. If you know of youth dancers, please pass the word to them that they are welcome to join us. This is mostly a youth get together/dance with a little competition added. Contact Karyn for more information. (503-873-4869 or buchheitfarmkm@gmail.com) 

May will have our last official dances until September as we are usually dark June, July and August. Petrina Buchheit
