Many dancers in the Portland area have danced with long, tall Gary Wells.  It was with a great deal of sorrow to learn of his passing.  He was a smooth dancer, both square and round.  He helped me and lots of other dancers to get our moves correctly.  I am not sure what other clubs he belonged to but he was a member of the Columbia River Dancers and the Happy Hoppers.
 In case l did not mention it before, Mary Brown is our new Treasurer and l have taken on the office of Vice President of Columbia River Dancers.
 Our May dances will be with legendary caller and cuer, Jim Hattrick.  We had 4 squares of dancers at our first lessons in April, with a new dancers dance planned for the last Sunday beginning at 6pm.
