We are dancing.  Second Fridays are Plus dances.  Fourth Fridays are Mainstream.  Randy Dibble is calling and Leonard Snodgrass is cueing.  We have begun new dancer lessons.  They began this past Tuesday, April 12th.  We have two more weeks of open lessons for those who would like to join us.  Lessons are at the Community Center in Newberg.  6:30 pm to 8:00 pm for new dancers and followed by 8 to 9:30 pm Advanced workshop for those interested in joining us for that.
