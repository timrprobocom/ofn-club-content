We look forward to calling and cueing for the dance on April 30.  This is the first Fifth Saturday dance since the pandemic started.  The dance starts at 7:30 with Pre-Rounds and then the square and round dance tips will begin at 8:00.  We end at 10:00. 
 
We know the mask mandate is over, but please wear one if you are more comfortable doing that.  We will have hand sanitizers at the front desk and on the tables.  Please bring your own water as the water fountain is still turned off due to COVID.  There will be no shared food.  

We look forward to calling and cueing for your dancing pleasure.  We are charging $8 per person.
