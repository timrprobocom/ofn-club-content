Timber Twirlers started back dancing in March after two years of being dark.  We want to thank those that have attended our first few dances. Our last dance will be May 20 as we go dark for the summer because our hall is not air-conditioned.

We are looking forward to Sept. and having our regular schedule of fun dances. Sandy
