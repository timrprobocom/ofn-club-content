May is here and with it the hope of an eternal Spring, or so they say.  Looks like it will happen now that we have gotten through the snows of April. 

This is also the time of year when clubs think about changing officers and board members. These last two years have seen many officers stay in their positions for two or even three years because there wasn’t much dance activity.  Now they are looking for replacements and they are hard to find. Many clubs, councils and even the Federation are having trouble getting people to volunteer. Remember our activity is totally volunteer-driven. If you do not want to see your club or council cease operating, step up and volunteer for a position.  Even if you think you are not qualified, you will be surprised at the amount of support you will receive.

Of course, we will always have the people who do not want to fill a position but will take every opportunity to tell the folks in those positions how to do their jobs. That just comes with the territory. Thankfully, those people are few and far between. So, if you feel led, step and take a position for your club or council. You will be surprised at what you can do and the assistance you will get.

Some venues and clubs are still requiring masks and/or proof of vaccination. That is their prerogative. Those clubs still need our support. If you can meet their requirements, please attend their dances.      
       
Hope to see you in a square soon and…

Let’s Start Dancing Again
