We had a great 57th anniversary dance on April 6th, with Daryl Clendenin.  He was our club caller during the 1973/74 year.  Tami cued that night.  She has been our club cuer since 1996.

April 29th, we will be hosting our council dance at Abernethy Grange.  It will feature Sarge and Cece Glidwell, the caller and cuer for the Klamath Country Squares.  It’s really a treat to welcome and dance to entertainment that doesn’t usually come up this way.
