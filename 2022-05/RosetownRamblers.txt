The Ramblers were delighted to welcome Chuck Simpkins and his wife Carla, all the way from Grants Pass, to our April monthly dance. This was Chuck's first time calling for the Ramblers, and he called a marvelous dance. In addition to lively tempos and creative patterns, Chuck provided tremendous guidance and encouragement to our new dancers and students. A great time was had by all!

We always tell our students that, in addition to being loads of fun, square dancing will introduce you to a wonderful and supportive community. Our words have certainly rung true lately. After our SSD instructor experienced some health problems over the past month and was unable to teach, we reached out to Daryl Clendenin to substitute. Without hesitation, Daryl stepped up and filled the gap with his trademark good sense, good humor, and good calling. Thanks to Daryl, we are still on target to graduate 19 students on May 14.

Speaking of...our graduation dance on May 14 will feature the amazing Eric Henerlau calling. What a treat to have this internationally renowned caller for our always entertaining Mad Plaid Grad dance. Wear your craziest combinations of plaids for this dance. Graduation ceremony (all welcome!) at 6:30, followed by Social Square Dance and Plus tips from 7 to 9:30. We dance at the Oak Grove Community Center, 14496 SE Cedar Ave., Portland.

See you in a square!
