Yippee!  We are back to dancing!  We dance every Sunday from 4 - 6.  Tim is a great caller and will call whatever level we can muster.  We've been dancing for a few weeks.  All of our dancers have had their two vaccinations and the booster.  We are continuing to wear our masks.  We have hand sanitizers on the tables. Please bring your own water.  

We invite you all to join us!  We're a fun bunch and have been gathering during the pandemic being masked and socially distanced just to visit and see each others' faces!

Please call our president, David, at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are, indeed, dancing.  Once in a blue moon we give up our dance night for the hall.
