We are happy to report that we have had a successful free dance on April 2nd.  Approx. 35 new people were learning the basics, and most expressed an interest in joining us again at the Kinton grange for the next free dance on Saturday May 14th, at 11:00-2:30.
 Our first dance in May is on the 6th.  This will be our Ducky Derby dance, with lots of Ducky-ness activity going on.  You won’t want to miss this one.  KC & Linda Curtis will call and Connie Clark will cue pre-rounds @ 7:30. Mainstream @ 8:00.
 May 7th Kinton grange will hold a plant sale, they always have lots to choose from.  May 20th will be a regular dance, pre-plus with KC & Linda Curtis calling & Julie Buchheit cueing.
 Toe’s will host the next 5th Saturday TVC dance, held at the Kinton grange on April 30th.  KC & Linda Curtis will call, no info on the who will cue at this time.
 Please join in the fun and friendship @ the Kinton Grange and dance with us! We are still just 5 ½ miles west of Washington Square, on Scholls Ferry Rd.
