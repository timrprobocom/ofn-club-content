The March TVC meeting was held via Zoom which will remain the meeting method at least through May.
 The TVCâ€™s slate of officer candidates is as follows:  President - Ursula Kuhn,  Vice President - Linda and K.C. Curtis,  Secretary - Andis Garuts, and Treasurer - Tammy LeBlanc.  The position of Federation State Delegate is open.  The slate of candidates will be voted on during the April TVC meeting and the new Officers will preside on June 1st.
 It was voted to uphold the previous decision to not require proof of vaccination at Council dances, though this may be affected by policy of the venue and the co-hosting club for each dance.  In general, abiding by the current State requirements has been a successful solution.
 Since the OFN is published about the 20th, you still have time to plan on attending the TVC Fifth Saturday Dance on Saturday, April 30th.  It will be held at the Kinton Grange, 7 to 10 pm, with KC Curtis calling and Julie Stiers cueing.  No Covid restrictions.
