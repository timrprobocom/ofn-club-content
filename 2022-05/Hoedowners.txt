March finally arrived and It’s like we’re all marching to a new drummer.  Can’t you just feel it in the air?  A balmy day, masks are optional, and dancers are returning!  Woo Hoo! 
 Hoedowners hosted two dances in March.  On the 12th Scott Zinser called and Randy Lewis cued.  While on the 26th KC Curtis led the dancers in squares and Randy Lewis did rounds.  Want to know the second most exciting development of March?  Masks were certainly #1 but #2 Hoedowners resumed our monthly pinochle games.  We love seeing our friends across a dance square, but we also look forward to seeing our friends across a square card table!  More to come!
 Our round lessons have been progressing.  Somehow, I thought a Triple Traveler was an equestrian event.  Turns out I was wrong. Connie Clark is still optimistic and teaching.
 A big Hoedowner welcome to our two brand spankn’ new members Jeffery and Dee.
 Please join us for our regularly scheduled dances in May on the 14th and 28th.  We have some surprises in store.  Masks and/or shields are optional.  We Can Not Wait to See You!!
