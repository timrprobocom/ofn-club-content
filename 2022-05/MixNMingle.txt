Easing up on dance mandates went well with everyone in March so M&M’s are continuing with their new “conditions”: proof of vaccination required but wearing a mask is optional.  Fingers crossed that it only gets better.  
 In this month of May we will be voting in a new Board - familiar names playing musical chairs into a new position.  We will only be dancing one night, May 7th, as we had to cancel our May 21st dance.  That only leaves just a handful of dances left until we go dark for the summer.  Our last dance is June 18th.  
 We hope you get a chance to join us at the Winona Grange to enjoy a night of dancing with Randy & Jeanine .  Be sure to check our website for any potential changes.
