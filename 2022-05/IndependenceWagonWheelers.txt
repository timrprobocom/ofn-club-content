We had a good dance for our 62nd birthday dance. Three to four squares and lots of black and white as those are our club colors. We had Dixie cups and birthday cake for munchies.

Molly Combs Fairly has joined Capital Callers and Cuers, ORDTA, and Roundalab so she can now fill in for Patty Hermann when Patty doesnâ€™t feel well. Such fun to watch her 2-year old daughter Brie run around the hall with daddy Bill not far behind.
We have a board meeting in May to discuss lessons for the fall, more special dances and hold elections. The past presidents had a gathering recently and welcomed the most recent past president to the group. Always a fun time since there are no rules to follow.

Come and join us as we dance from 7-10 p.m. on the first and second Saturday of each month except for August. Marilyn Schmit
