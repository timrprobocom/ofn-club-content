Well, we have made it through another month. We are finishing Jive on April 21 and will have a workshop/review with Leonard Snodgrass as the instructor on April 28. During May we will just have workshops/reviews with Randy Lewis since he will be recovering from hip replacement surgery on April 27. He will be unable to be on the dance floor to teach so we will start a new class of something in June, depending on what his doctor says he can do. The waltz class will pause during May and finish up in June or whenever Randy gets to the bottom of the list for Phase 4.

We are collecting dues and names for office holders through April. Hope all are enjoying spring and the warmer weather. Marilyn
