We started our lessons on March 19th and have been doing pretty well. All seem to be having a good time.  We hope to plan another set of lessons in June but that is not positive yet.  

Dances have not been well attended.  I don't know if it is people not wanting to come back yet due to Covid or just so many dancers have dropped out of the activity.
Hopefully we will get some help soon from the area dancers before we have to become a traveling club.

Hope to see you at one of our dances soon.
