Yes, we are back!  Member-only refresher workshops began in April, and in May the refreshers will be open to all dancers!  We dance at the Tigard Grange, 2:00: Round Dance refreshers with cuer Sandra Pinion, and 3:30-5:30: Mainstream refreshers with our caller Terry Halley.  On Sunday afternoons: May 1, 15, 22, and 29.  We still ask that dancers wear masks for now.  Cost $5 at the door.  (And our first two "real" dances are coming up in June, on Sunday afternoons. 
 Please see our website trisquares.com or the OFN for flyers.) Also in May we will be deciding whether to keep our previous dance nights or to change our dances to Sunday afternoons.  A lot is going on at Tri Squares!
