R Square D had a class-level dance in March that was great fun and we had a few students dancing with us that night.  Our Spring Celebration dance on the fourth Saturday was lively and fun with Jim Hattrick and Susan Healea as our caller and cuer.
 We have only one dance in May.  Itâ€™s our Fiesta De Mayo Dance on Friday, May 13th. Craig Abercrombie is calling and Patty Hermann will cue this dance.  Plus dancing and intermediate rounds are from 7-8 and the mainstream dance with phase II rounds is from 8-9:30.  We are dark on the fourth Saturday for Memorial Day weekend.
 Our lessons are continuing on Wednesday evenings with plus at 6:30 PM and the beginning/mainstream class from 7:30-9:00.  The classes will wrap up in mid-May.
 After a two-year absence, we will hold Octoberfest this year!  It will be October 14-15 at Catlin Grange in Kelso.  Callers for this are Craig Abercrombie and Adam Christman.  Our featured cuer is Susan Healea.  Put those dates on your calendar and watch for more news as it gets closer.
 R Square D dances at Kelso Senior Center, 108 NW 8th Ave, Kelso, WA.  Our hall is air conditioned and masks are not required.
