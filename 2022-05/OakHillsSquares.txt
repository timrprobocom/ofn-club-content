The Oak Hills squares continue to hold lessons on Monday’s from 6.30-7.30pm at the gym in Oak Hills On NW 153rd Ave.  We have 9 students who are doing great.  We then dance mainstream until 8.30pm with our fabulous caller, Mark Wheeler.
 The first Monday of each month we will dance mainstream from 7.30-9pm and we welcome other clubs to come along and join us. The dances will be themed, the hall decorated and we will have tasty treats available.
 Monday, May 2nd will be our next dance, with the theme of “Friendship” as we have one of our founding couples coming to visit from their new home in Florida.  We hope to also welcome a lot of fellow dancers from other clubs.
 If you cannot make the first Monday of the month dance then please feel free to come and visit on any Monday evening.
 Mask wearing is optional, however we do require all dancers to be vaccinated.
