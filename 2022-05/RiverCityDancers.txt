We have been active and busy. Our dances on the second and third Saturday of each month are doing well. We also hosted a new dancers dance that had over four squares. Julia Buchiet was our guest cuer that day and did a very nice job . Thank you Julia. 

Our clothing resale was a big success and we now have more room in our storage area to move around. 

Lessons continue and our students will graduate On May 1.

We dance every second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community club in Milwaukie. The welcome mat is always out for others to join us for a fun night of dancing to the calling of our caller Darrell Kalmbach and cuer Tami Helms.
