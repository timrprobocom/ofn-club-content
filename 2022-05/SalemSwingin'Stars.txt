Happy Spring.  We continue to have great dances.  Thank you to all of the dancers who come out to our 1st, 3rd and 5th Fridays.  

There were four squares on the floor for our Dress like a Fool, April Fool's Day Dance. We had a blast and the crazy outfits were so much fun to see. Our 56th Birthday dance was April 15.  Election of officers were held at this dance. April 29 is our 5th Friday Plus dance with Special Guest Cuer Jeanine  We are looking forward to our May dances. 

We have 13 students in our beginning Mainstream class and five of them are ages 8-16.  We have four squares on the floor each week.  The new dancers are learning fast and having fun.

We do not go dark for the summer as we dance all year long. See you on the dance floor.  Sheila Machado
