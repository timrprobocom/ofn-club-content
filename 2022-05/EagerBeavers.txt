Eager Beaversâ€™ dances in March continued with a half-hour of Plus review followed by our regular dance of Plus and Rounds.  Our wonderful teams on alternating weeks are caller Darrell Kalmbach with cuer Jeanine Norden, and Jim Hattrick as caller/cuer.
 The new slate of officers has been elected and will be installed in May.  Co-Presidents: Karen and Ferrous Steinka, Co-Vice President: John Semm and Leslie Tallman, Secretary: Dee Rice, Co-Treasurers: Sally and Mike Duyck, TVC Delegates: Alice Hendricks and Judy Groom.
 Our club voted to continue to require proof of vaccination for our dances in April and to revisit the issue in May, but masks are optional.
 We dance every Monday afternoon from 1:00 to 3:00.  For up-to-date information see our website at http://EagerBeavers.info.
