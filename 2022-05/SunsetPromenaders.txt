We have been moving ahead with lessons starting out with 13 students but since have dropped those numbers down to about 6 people.
 Starting in May we will be having cookies, water and coffee after the dances for some social time.
 We voted for officers and the new slate is; President Judy Schnase, Vice President  Ed Mickelson, Secretary Diane Pratt, and Treasure Lalani Radford.  Thank you all for stepping up to take on those jobs.  Also would like to give a big shout out to those who were doing those duties during the last couple years through all the turmoil of Covid.  It seems we have made it through and are still having fun dancing.
 Promenaders will be co-sponsoring the Seaside Sashay this year Oct. 21 2022.  The cost for the weekend will be $20.00.  The Callers will be Randy Dibble and Stephen Nosack from the Seattle Area.  Debbie Taylor will be the cuer.
 Our normal schedule is 1st and 3rd Saturday for Mainstream, 1st, 3rd, and 5th Thursday for Plus.  We dance at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro near 3rd and Main.  We no longer require proof of vaccination and masks are optional.  See our website for further information, http://sunsetpromenaders.com.
