Willamette Squares March dance was well attended and thoroughly enjoyed by all. We appreciated the visitations from other clubs. Due to Covid, our last dance was our birthday dance in October 2021, so everyone was very happy to be together once again. It was our new callerâ€™s, Bruce Lowther, first dance for our club. He was well received. Judy Russell was our cuer. We are back to having a food table providing refreshments for those who are comfortable partaking of it. The pizza and cupcakes went fast.

At our club meeting we established themes for our upcoming dances. In April it will be Eggstravaganza; in May it will be Barbecue, Brisket, and Burgers! Save the fourth Saturday evening of each month and join us. There is always good energy and fun!  Jodee Howard
