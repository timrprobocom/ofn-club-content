The Hayshakers are dancing again on the 2nd & 4th Saturday of every month from 7 until 9 o’clock with Mark Wheeler calling. We have many new students, so the first 1½ hours dance time is devoted to teaching square dance and the remainder to dance Mainstream and a little Plus.  Our website is hayshakers.org
