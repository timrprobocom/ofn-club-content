The SSD class graduated April 12th with 6 new dancers. Welcome!!  We had a fun time at our dance on April 16th with Wayne and Bob, in spite of the low turnout.

Our dances in May will have Chuck calling and Elaine and Mary cueing - Elaine on the 7th and Mary on the 21st.  We will also have an SSD Dance on May 13th w/Chuck. Memorial weekend is coming up faster than you think!! Going to be a great festival with Eric Henerlau & Dan(Allison) Drumheller!!  There is still time to get your pre-registrations in for a discount on the weekend price.  We are looking forward to having a great time with everyone!!

New SSD classes will start on 4/19 and we hope to get a great turnout; maybe some of the 50++ dancers who attended our dance a few weeks ago!!

We are so happy to be getting back to some normalcy and it's great to see everyone's smiling faces!!

See you on the dance floor!!
