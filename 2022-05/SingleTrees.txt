In March we held two dances since none of the other clubs had resumed dancing and our members felt they were getting rusty.  K.C. Curtis called our first dance and Jim Hattrick called our second dance on the 4th Friday, our normal dancing night.  We had an impromptu  visitation from our friends to the north, mostly Salem Swingin’ Stars but also some from Lebanon Square Circlers and Corvallis Squares.  We were very happy to see them join us.  Both dances were a lot of fun.  Since masking was optional by the 4th Friday, we allowed dancers to bring food to share although I think most were so used to not bringing food to share that there wasn’t much on the break bar.  I am sure as time passes people will get more into it.  Meanwhile we come for the dancing not the food.

Neil Koozer cued the 2nd Friday night.  We were super happy to see Jackie Gale return to calling for us on the 4th Friday.  It was truly a regular dance.  Some dancers do continue to wear masks, but the vast majority feel with vaccinations and boosters and a stricture to stay away if one is not feeling well that we are on firm ground.  

We hope more will join us on April 22 when we will have Scott Zinser calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  On May 14 we will offer a combined dance with our sister club, the Whirl-A-Ways.  It is our Mexican Fiesta dance and will feature a taco bar as always.  Please mark your calendars for that fun dance!  Mike Kious will be calling and 
Christina Corelli will be cueing.
