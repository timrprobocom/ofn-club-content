As mentioned in the Bachelor ‘n’ Bachelorettes news (and the Chaps & Petticoats’ news), our council dance will be April 29th, 7:PM, at Abernethy Grange Oregon City.  This will be an off-dance night for the B&B’s, but they have graciously offered to host our dance.  The Glidewell’s will be the featured caller and cuer from the Klamath Country Squares.  They are very popular at the dance festivals across the state.
