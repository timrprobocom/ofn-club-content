Did you attend our March 18th dance with Mark Wheeler as Caller and Leonard Snodgrass as Cuer?  This was the first time we booked these two together - it was a winner!  Mark even closed the evening with ‘Elvis’ on stage.  Thanks to all for making it a fun night.

On April 1st (no foolin’) we hosted our HIPPIE Dance. It was well attended - we had four squares.  We encouraged costumes and you, the dancers, elected the winners:  Male was Robert Lumsden (County Cut-Ups), Female was our very own Vicki Pounds (we think she was sharp as a redhead) and Couple was awarded to Gene and Patricia (with their fringed vest and flared bell-bottoms) of Bachelor & Bachelorettes.

If you are in the Portland Area on April 29th, the Glidewells (from Klamath Falls) will call and cue for PAC’s 5th Friday dance held at the Abernethy Grange, a/k/a Bachelor and Bachelorettes hall, in Oregon City.

Chaps will dance the 1st and 3rd Friday’s on:   May 6th - opens PLUS with Zinser and Stephanie Lozano cues, on May 20th, theme is “Flags of Valor” with Darrell Kalmbach, Caller, and Dave Cooper (all the way from So. Coast Council) will cue and on June 3rd - Zinser opens with PLUS and Julia Buchheit cues.

See you in a square,
Betty Chipps
