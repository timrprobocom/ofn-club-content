On Sunday, April 3, we held our first advanced dance since last summer when we managed to get in two dances before deciding to shut down due to the surge in COVID cases.  Since case counts are low as well as hospitalizations, we have chosen to start dancing again.  We only had one square of dancers and some extras to swap out but are hopeful weâ€™ll see more come out in future.  The next dance will be on April 17, but this report had to be in by the 10th so I cannot report on it.  We look forward to having more regular dances.

We dance in Hall B of the Emerald Square Dance Center from 1:30-3:30PM two Sundays a month depending on the availability of the hall and dancers.  Please consult our website at cas-sd.yolasite.com for the tentative schedule.  Also if you want to be on the email notification list call Fred Beise at 458-221-3564.
