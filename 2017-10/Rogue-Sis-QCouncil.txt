Are we tired of the smoke yet? There were a couple of days when the smoke went the other way. The skies were blue and the sun shone. The temperatures were in the 80's. Thank COD for the respite, if only for a few days. More are coming.

Since this report is being written the middle of September, a report on the September 29 Council Dance would be very inaccurate. So, we will say, we are anticipating a good turnout for the dance on the 29th . Our Council dances have been doing well since we added Advanced dancing to the format. See you there and thanks for supporting OUR Council.

Now that new classes have started, PLEASE help your clubs by angeling. Angels are very important to the future of our Clubs because they are the impression the new dancers get of the CIUb. We need to help the newbies all we can.

Don't forget to support the Council and the Clubs in the Rogue Valley.

The next Council meeting will be October 2, 2017 at Denny's Restaurant on Biddle Road at 4:30pm.

There are still "Learn to Square Dance" t-shirts available. I have quite a few 2X's. We have found the t-shirts are a great conversation starter.
