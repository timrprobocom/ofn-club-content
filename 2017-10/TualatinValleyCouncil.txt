Since the OFN is published mid month, you may still have time to plan on attending the Dance & OFSRDC State Meeting on September 16th &17th at the Kinton Grange.  The Toe Draggers will be serving a country style dinner at 6:00 PM on the 16th followed by a dance with KC and Bev Flint as MC's.  The dance will start with pre-rounds at 7:00 pm, followed by a mainstream square dance & level 2-3 rounds at 7:30 pm with every 3rd tip plus.  Callers and cuers from the floor will be welcome.  TVC please bring desserts or finger foods for the break at 10:00 pm.  The following morning, Sunday September 17th, the State meeting will be held.  This weekend is a great opportunity for you to meet with and visit with your Oregon Federation of Square and Round Dance Club officers and delegates from around Oregon.  Our own Kathy Roberts will be installed as Federation President.
 Our next Council event is the Tri-Council Dance on September 30th.  It will be held at the Oak Grove Community Center, 14496 Southeast Cedar Avenue, Oak Grove, OR 97267.  This dance will feature the Wildcards calling with Lonnie Sycks cueing.  Format: 7-7:30 pm Plus; 7:30-7:50 pm Advanced Rounds; 7:50-8:00 Rounds; 8:00-10:00 Mainstream.
