Hello to all of you wonderful dancers out there.  As you read this, our Annual Corn n Cluck Dance on September 15 has already happened and Iâ€™m sure we had a great time. The chicken appeared as he has for the last several years. 
We have danced all summer long and had great times. We visited the Silver City Squares and Valley River Dancers in September and are planning more visitations in the coming month. September 29 is our 5th Friday Plus dance. Randy Dibble will call and Ken Pratt will cue.  Pre-Rounds start at 7:00 pm, Advanced at 7:30 pm, Plus with Rounds 8:00 -10:15 pm., followed by a final Advanced tip.
We are all anxiously awaiting the return of our Cuer Jeanine Norden who had a very bad fall and is still recuperating.  Get Well Soon, Jeanine, we miss you!!
We are looking forward to our new dancers joining the ranks. Mainstream Lessons started on September 13, 6:30 -8:00 pm.  Advanced Lessons 8:00 -9:30 pm.
We dance on the first and third Fridays of the month so come join us. Our hall is air conditioned for your dancing comfort. Sheila Machado
