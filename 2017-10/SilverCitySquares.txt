We are back in the swing of things. Our island pie night was fun for those who attended. Lots of good pies and desserts!  Thanks to those who attended.
We had fun at the state fair dancing on Saturday, September 2 to Thomas Buchheit and Leonard (our "Mystery Caller"). We had a little over one square of dancers so there was a lot of trading in and out. Thomas and Leonard kept us hopping as they traded mikes.
Mom (Karyn Buchheit) has it confirmed with the Silverton High School principal - the teen festival will be there!!!!! They are in the process of trying to finalize paperwork. Don't forget to buy a teen festival pin from us this year - not only does this support us, it is your "pass ribbon" into the festival and lets you attend both the Friday night open dance and the competition on Saturday. (Prices for the pins are higher at the door!)
Our new dancer lessons started on Tuesday, September 12. We will let you know next report how they are going. See you at a dance soon. Petrina Buchheit
