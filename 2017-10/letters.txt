<li><a>Letter of thanks from Les & Paula Seeley</a>
<div>
<p>FIRST-----we can&rsquo;t possibly thank each of you individually for all your kindness and expression of love over all the years. It would take up all the space and time available for a long time. Please know everyone and every act of kindness extended to us is filed away in our heads and hearts and our office wall. This letter is a special thanks for all of the support and kindness shown in our preparation to move and the move itself.</p>
<p>THANKS to those that helped us with our garage sale and purging of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;.</p>
<p>THANKS for the going away dance sponsored by the River City Dancers. You gave us $1750 to help with the moving costs.</p>
<p>THANKS to all the dancers with whom we stayed during our recent vacation trip in July and August as well as those that offered and those that would have offered had the opportunity presented itself.</p>
<p>THANKS to the clubs that asked us to call during our vacation trip. And a special THANKS to Renee&rsquo; Ruud for calling and singing with me for many years.</p>

<p>THANKS to Daryl Clendenin for his guidance and encouragement.</p>
<p>THANKS to the family members that had a bar-b-que for us.</p>
<p>THANKS to one of our sons and his wife for letting us use their lovely house at the Washington coast.</p>
<p>We had a very nice drive back to our new house (to us anyway) in Surprise, Arizona and hope to have all things in order by the end of September.</p>
