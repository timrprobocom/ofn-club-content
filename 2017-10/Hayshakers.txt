When we had our picnic last month, we had a discussion on when we wanted to dance.  So here is the answer.  We will dance on the 1st Friday of every month at the Astoria Senior Center.  The address is:  1111 Exchange St.  The time is from 6 to 8.  Then on the 3rd Friday of the month, we will dance at the Pacific Grange.  The time is also 6 to 8.  We have to do this as the Grange is being used at that time and this is a simple solution.  You still need you to call to make sure we have enough people for the dance.
 Remember to join us at the Seaside Sashay, October 27th and 28th, in Seaside Oregon.  The dance features Dan Preedy and Darrell Kalmbach calling with Debbie Taylor cueing.  A fun and eventful weekend with dancing on the turnaround, weather permitting.  Also, do not forget the mud wrestling competition!
