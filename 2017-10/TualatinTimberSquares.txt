The Crockpot is on at the Tualatin Timber Squares!  We are kicking up our heels the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays at the Winona Grange in Tualatin.
 Every time you visit Tualatin Timber Squares you get another chance to enter our drawing for one ribbon to the MidWinter Festival in Albany.  Every paid dancer gets a ticket for every dance they attend to put in the raffle basket.  Drawing will be held at our Ugly Christmas Sweater dance on December 13th.  Must be present at the 12/13/17 dance to win.  
 Like us on Facebook or join our newsletter to keep informed on what is going on in our area of the world and how you, too, can join in on the fun!
