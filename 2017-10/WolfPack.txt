The Wolf Pack had their annual picnic at Island Park on August 26th. As always, a great time visiting with friends and family and of course some square dancing.

Our Back to school dance on September 2nd was another fun Wolf Pack dance with an enthusiastic group in spite of competing with the Labor Day weekend and the Duckâ€™s home opener at Autzen Stadium.

Next up is our Fall Dance on Saturday, October 6th. Hope you can join us.
