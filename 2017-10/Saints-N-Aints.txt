Saint’s & Aint’s held summer dances with jamboree callers and cuers. This gave the new local callers a chance to practice their skills. They did great and the dances were well attended and lots of fun for all. A demo dance was held during the Coos Bay Blackberry Arts festival. Flyers regarding the benefits and availability of square dance in the area were handed out to the crowd. The club has gone dark for both dances in September. The first dance so members could attend Port Orford’s Labor Day Weekend, and the second due to multiple member’s absence. Another demo dance is to be held at a local medical clinics grand opening of their remodel. We will bring visitors into the squares to introduce the fun of square dance. We are hoping this will bring interested new dancers and so have delayed the start of fall lessons until the first Sunday in October.
