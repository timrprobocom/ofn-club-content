<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">As I write my first article for the President&rsquo;s Corner, I am filled with gratitude.&nbsp; Thank you to my home club the Toe Draggers for hosting the State meetings, dinner and dance last weekend. It was a busy weekend for our club with our 42<sup>nd</sup> Anniversary dance the night before. Thank you to our council, the TVC, for attending and supporting our anniversary dance and all of our State activities.&nbsp; Thank you to our friends and dancers in neighboring councils for coming to both dances and the dinner on Saturday. And finally, thank you to all of the State Delegates and Officers who took time out of their busy schedules throughout the state to come to our club for the weekend.&nbsp; It was a fun weekend full of great music, food, friendships, and square dance business.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">I would also like to give a special thank you to our outgoing OFSRDC president Marilyn Schmit and her board for all of their work on behalf of the dancers of Oregon.&nbsp; Marilyn is tireless in her efforts on behalf of the dancers.&nbsp; She has been a great mentor to me this year and I hope to continue in her footsteps.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">This year, I would like to encourage all of us to focus on working together to support each other&rsquo;s clubs by visiting other clubs, promoting not only our own clubs, but clubs in our areas, and special events throughout the state.&nbsp; During the next year, I will be offering suggestions and looking for ideas to share on how we can help each other.&nbsp; Working together we will all be successful.</p>
