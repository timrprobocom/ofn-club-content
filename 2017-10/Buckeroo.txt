The heat has finally begun to subside, and fall is beginning to show its beautiful colors here in the Umpqua Valley. As with many other spots in Oregon, we have had our share of smoke and ash from the wild fires. Hopefully things will clear up as the fall progresses and we get some long awaited rain!

Our first dance of the month was our Red, White, and Blue Dance. We had guest caller Dale Roberson call for us, and Rikki Lobato cued for the round dancers. We had a nice turnout and everyone had a great time! Dale brings lots of energy and years of experience with him….in fact, he used to be our regular club caller before he retired. We always enjoy having him back in the barn!

Our second dance was our Pacific Islander/Polynesian Dance. It is always fun to dance to an island theme when the fall has brought cooler weather and rain. Chuck Simpkins called the squares and Neil Koozer cued the rounds.

The Buckeroos began a new set of lessons this month. We had a good number of students show up and are excited to see the energy in the group. We are already looking forward to dancing with them at Mid-Winter!  Speaking of Mid-Winter, we will have Buckeroo Round-Up ribbons for sale, so do not forget to find us and get yours! Scot Byers will be the featured caller this year, and his wife Erin will be the cuer.

We have another big event coming up on November 4th…a special celebration dance to honor Dale Roberson and his 50 plus years of calling! Watch the OFN for the upcoming flyer and plan to join us. You will be glad you made the drive!

Remember… we are just a short drive south from the Portland area, so plan to join us in the near future. We dance the first and third Saturdays and always enjoy having visitors. We have members of all ages and are a family friendly club.


Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
