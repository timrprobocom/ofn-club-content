Kris Jensen was here again recently and called for us. What a treat! Kris is a national caller from Albuquerque. Kris and Kurt's mom moved up from Medford to Eugene which makes it easier to visit without the extra travel time. Eugene has wonderful opportunities for senior living. Kurt is our Vice-President.  
 
One of our members from Albany, Cheryl Hagey, is still recovering from a fall she suffered at the national convention in Cincinnati. She has been able to dance a little!  Yippee! We can't for her to be 100% Tim Hagey is the new secretary for the State Federation. We thank those dancers willing to hold an office. It's a commitment we appreciate.
 
We dance from 5:30 - 8:00 pm almost every Sunday in Hall A at the Emerald Dance Center at 2095 Yolanda in Springfield. Please go to the When and Where to see if we are dancing on any particular Sunday.  All levels welcome. Lessons/dances are always casual dress. 
 
Kirby Goode remains on 'in home' hospice care. Right now he's bed-ridden as he had  a fall a couple of weeks into August. He misses everyone and welcomes visitors.
 
An article on Spin Cycle Squares square dancing appeared in the Eugene Weekly. It was an interesting article as the reporter is a young gal and her perspective was unique and different. Tim Matteson got the reporter and her friend in a square. They loved it. 
 
Please come and join us for some fun dancing and food. There's always a lot of food!
 
Happy Dancing!
Christina Corelli, Member-at-Large
