This summer has been a very hot and dry one, however, the Tumbleweeds have AC and that helped continue all of our Friday afternoon dances. In August the OFSRDC President, Marilyn Schmit, presented to our oldest member, Dell Uptegrove, 100, a certificate and medal from National USDA, honoring him as a centenarian. Watch for an article about him coming up soon in the National USDA magazine. We are honored to have him in our club. Coming up on October 27 will be our annual Halloween costume dance. Hope to see you there to join in the fun.

Starting in January, Daryl Clendenin, will be our club caller. We look forward to having him call for us.
