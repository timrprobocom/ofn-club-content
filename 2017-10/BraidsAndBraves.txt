In September we began dancing at our new hall, 606 4th Street in Dayton. We are excited! We still dance the third Saturday of each month. We'll be starting Square Dance classes Sunday evenings starting Sept. 10 at the Yamhill Valley Heritage Center Museum.

August was busy with demos at the Yamhill Valley Heritage Center in McMinnville and with the Independence Wagon Wheelers in Rickreall. Letâ€™s get out and celebrate a new dance year on the dance floor!  Carmen
