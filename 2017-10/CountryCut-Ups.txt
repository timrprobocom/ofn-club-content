We are off to a running start for autumn. While the colorful leaves are falling, we will be keeping the Boring Barn busy. If you read this early, catch our 5th Saturday all Plus dance on Sept. 30th. October will start out with our Anniversary Dance on Oct. 7th with Craig Abercrombie. We will be hosting the Annual Ham Egg and Pancake Breakfast and Bazaar on October 22nd from 8 AM to 1:00 PM. Who knows what surprises you might find at the Bazaar? On October 28th, Scott Zinser will call our 4th Saturday dance and we will have a Spooky Halloween Black Light Dance. Come at 7 PM for Plus or 7:30 PM for Mainstream. Every Thursday evening, we will be holding Mainstream lessons from 7:30 to 9:30 PM. On October 29th, we will be hosting another event for the foreign exchange students in the area. They will go to the pumpkin patch across the street from the Barn, then come join us for dinner and a square dance lesson. It is a fundraiser for our club and a fun time for the students and their families.

We hope to see many guests at our Barn this month for one or more of these functions. It is always fun to dance with the Country Cut-Ups!
