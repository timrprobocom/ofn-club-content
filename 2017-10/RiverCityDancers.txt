We have been enjoying dancing with our very talented guest callers . It was a very special treat to have Les Seeley back for a visit and calling for us . We miss him and Paula and it was so nice to see and visit with them again. 

We enjoy welcoming guests to come dance with us and this past month we enjoyed a visitation from Tumbleweeds and Columbia River Dancers. A visitation from our club to visit those clubs is in our plans for fall and winter. We are looking forward to it.

August was also the time we have our annual club picnic on a beautiful piece of property beside a creek belonging to one of our members. We love going there and appreciate her having us each year.

September 10 marks the beginning of our club square dance lessons  which are being taught by caller Craig Abercrombie. Our lessons will continue every Sunday from September 10 at 5:30 PM at our hall at Milwaukie Community center on 42nd and Jackson . Our club dances are at the same location every second and third Saturday. Remember .. we love having company and welcome all dancers. Come dance with us. 

Our usual club reporter Nancy Thornton is recovering from some health issues and I, Carol Mendenhall, am adding the club news during her absence. We all wish her a speedy recovery.
