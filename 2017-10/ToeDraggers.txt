One of the warmest summers I can remember, but it was a great one.  We have been busy as a club.  Our campout was held down in Lincoln City, tremendous weather with lots to do.  Our club is a great one to have fun with.  Next year we are going to Vernonia to camp.
 Lessons started September 13th.  Fun group of newcomers.  Lessons are being held at the Kinton Grange.  Thanks KC and Linda for all of your work.  Bev and Harlan will start Round Dance lessons in January.
 Our Anniversary Dance September 15th will be a blast.  The Wildcards will give us a fun evening as our callers, with our own Bev Flint and Dave Cooper cueing.  The next night Toes will host the State Dance, with KC calling and Bev cueing.  We are so proud of our own Kathy Roberts stepping into the state president position.  Thanks to everyone stepping up and helping us to have a grand weekend of dancing.
 We are looking forward to our Dance for the Cure on October 1st.  Be sure to wear pink and come for fun.  All donations collected will be given to Breast Cancer Research at OHSU Knight Cancer Institute.  This is our 10th Man Enough To Wear Pink Dance….  Sunday afternoon from 1:30 to 4:30 pm at the Kinton Grange.  A variety of baskets will be raffled during the dance.  We hope to see you there.
