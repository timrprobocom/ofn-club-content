The Hall was dark in August, but the IWW Club had a banner month anyway. Two and a half squares of IWW dancers traveled to Oak Grove on August 5 for a visitation to the Oaky Doaks to surprise and support our wonderful caller George (and Patty) Hermann. Then most of our members helped direct parking and collect admissions at the Polk County Fair, our main club fund raiser. On August 19, IWW hosted square dance lessons for the general public and a demonstration dance at the Polk County Fairgrounds as part of the Total Eclipse celebration. George Hermann outdid himself as teacher and caller, the drop-in students had a blast, and we expect to see several of them at lessons in September.

Our first dance of the new dance year was a birthday party for our caller George Hermann, at which we deluged him with birthday cards and surprised him with a birthday cake. 

Thank goodness for the trees and shade at Maud Williamson State Park where we had our annual picnic during the Labor Day Weekend heat wave. Thanks to Tim Hagey for organizing a fabulous picnic. We’re back to our usual schedule, dancing at the Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall on the first and second Saturday’s beginning at 7:00. George Hermann is our caller. October guest cuers are Sandra Pinion (October 7) and Mark McDonald (October 14).  Our Veterans’ Day special dance approaches – watch for details.  Come dance with us! Dee and Bert Mackaman
