The Charlie's are glad to be back in the swing of things!! We had our first class for Beginner Square Dance Lessons on Sept 12th. We had 19 new students, who all seemed quite enthusiastic. It was nice to see all ages represented and we hope they all come back and bring their friends. There are two more classes open to new dancers.  Chuck Simpkins is teaching our beginner's class, as well as the Mainstream workshop, and he did a great job.
We are looking forward to some wonderful dancing in October!! October 7th we will welcome guest caller Michael Kious and guest cuer Rikki Lobato. This will be our Mainstream & Plus dance, with pre-rounds at 730pm.
Mark your calendars for October 21st when the Charlie's will welcome National Caller & Cuer Scot & Erin Byars. We are so excited to have them in Grants Pass. Scot will call Advanced starting 6pm and Erin will be doing PreRounds at 730pm.  We will have Alternating Mainstream & Plus tips from 8-1030pm.  We would love to have lots of friends visit!! This is our Apple Harvest Dance and we will be having a bake sale - so bring your best goodies!!
We are planning a great party for our 50th Birthday Dance on December 2nd!! We have National caller Charlie Robertson to entertain us!! He is an exceptional caller, and if you have never danced to him - You don't want to miss this opportunity!!! We will also have the wonderful Steve(Valerie) Murphy over from Klamath Falls to provide some great rounds!
