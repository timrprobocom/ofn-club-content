There is no denying that the month of August was hot.  That stopped us once because the Hazel Dell Grange does not have air-conditioning.  The 26th was warm and the dancing was great.  Our lessons have been going really well and some of the new dancers were there to try out what they have learned.  Our lessons start the first Tuesday of each month so if you have someone who missed starting in September, no problem.  Jim has round-dance instruction from 6-7 and beginning lessons starting at 7 and mainstream about 8:30.
 Our October 14 dance will have Darrell Kalmbach calling and Julie Stout cueing.  We will be dark on the 28th as we are planning a great time at the Seaside Sashay that weekend.  We encourage everyone to go.
 Keep in mind that our Turkey Burn-off will be coming up on the 25th of November with guest caller Dan Nordbye calling.
 Did you know that nineteen states have declared the Square Dance as their official Dance?
