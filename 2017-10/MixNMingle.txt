Big 33 this year.  Yup, our 33rd Birthday Dance is coming up October 21.  While the actual date is the first Saturday in November, we shift it to October to avoid Royal Romp.  As always, Lindie will have her containers of M&Ms for people to guess the number in each container.  The mathematicians try to calculate and often come very close.  Come see if you can out-calculate them.  
 As this is being written we don't have further word as to when Jeanine Norden will be back with us.  We hope that she will be healed and healthy by the time you read this.  At this point she needs to concentrate on getting well.  We miss her and wish her a speedy and complete recovery.
