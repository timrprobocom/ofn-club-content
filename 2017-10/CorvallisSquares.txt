As I write this, we're looking ahead to our fall lessons starting on September 25, and we're hoping for a good-sized class.

Our dance season started on Sept. 9 and we're grateful to be able to continue dancing at the hall at the Congregational church with its lovely wood floor. Later, on October 28, we're having our yearly Halloween dance and it will be a fun and festive time! Happy Autumn everyone! Karen
