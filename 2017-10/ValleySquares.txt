Valley Squares is dark the first Saturday of October to attend Sunset Promenaders Anniversary Dance. 
 Don those Halloween costumes early and join us for our Halloween Dance October 21st.  Darrell Kalmbach will be calling with Connie Clark cueing. 
 We were "tickled" by Scott Zinser's sense of humor at our 1st Saturday dance in August, and root beer floats were a welcome treat from the heat at our third Saturday gala, called by Craig Abercrombie. 
 Smoky skies meant some members enjoyed our picnic inside Southminster Presbyterian Church while others stayed outside to play croquet and dine under the trees. 
 Our August visitation was cancelled.
