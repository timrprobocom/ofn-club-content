Does the end of August signal the end of summer?  Maybe not.  The Hahn Barn dance on August 27 was cancelled due to hot weather.  We can hope for better luck next year.  At least we are not flooded by a hurricane, and we can attend the Oregon State Fair to see square dance presentations.  
 Our picnic at Noble Woods Park was postponed twice hoping for slightly cooler weather.  Excellent food, prepared mostly by members, caused a good deal of overeating.  Then we were expected to play beanbag baseball and people did join in the fun because we did not have to stand up the whole time; we rested in our camp chairs between turns at bat cheering our team on.  If you hit the Home Run hole you had to “run” the bases.  Judy provided us with some great photos.  Thanks to everyone for making the picnic a success.  
 We rarely cancel our dance but we did this year for an even rarer event, a solar eclipse.  I went to Summit, west of Corvallis, in order to enjoy totality which is awesome.  We were joined by a van full of eclipse enthusiasts who had driven all the way from southern California to take photos.  We had fun photographing the little crescent shadows that form as the sun reappears.  Afterwards we adjourned to a coffee shop called Imagine, which has a neat name and great mochas.  
 After a very successful Plus Class earlier this year we are repeating our program starting at noon, Monday February 5th, running into May.  If you are thinking about learning or brushing up on Plus be ready to join us.  We will have the same three great callers giving the lessons: Daryl Clendenin, Jim Hattrick, and Darrell Kalmbach.
 We will be in Seaside for our beach trip this year, October 4th - 6th, which is later than usual but Kay Rogers found a good place for us.
