Tri Squares was dark in July and August, but we scheduled visitations to clubs with air conditioning and had a great time.  On Friday, September 22nd, we're having our 19th Anniversary Dance, with national caller Adam Christman, and hope everybody comes. (Surely it will be cooler by then?!)  Then on Sunday, September 24th, we begin B-51 lessons for 10 weeks -- the first two are free -- from 3:30-5:30.  
 On Sunday, October 8th, weâ€™ll start Mainstream Workshops at 2:00; open to all square dancers for $3 a visit.  You could even spend the whole afternoon with us as angels for the B-51 lessons which follow.  And please join us for our October dances on the 14th and 27th, celebrating cool autumn, crisp apples, and Halloween.
