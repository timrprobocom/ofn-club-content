It is early September and I have to write for October. The end of summer brought some really warm weather but we kept on dancing anyway. We have pretty much finished some of the Latin movements for mambo and rumba. We start intermediate waltz lessons on September 14, with an unknown quantity of students attending. We are hoping that some or all of the summer class of cha cha students will continue on and gain more floor time in various rhythms. 

A bunch of us attended the 50th anniversary party for Richard and Karen Rubicam at the dance center. It was a very nice party with some good food and lots of dancing, and sharing friendship with the guests who attended. 

We are planning a New Yearâ€™s Eve party and hope that you will make plans to attend and bring in 2018 with us. Stay tuned for more details. If any of you would like a flyer, please contact me and I will email you one.

Hope that all of you will support your local clubs in their endeavors to have lessons and get more people interested in our favorite pastime of dancing. Marilyn Schmit
