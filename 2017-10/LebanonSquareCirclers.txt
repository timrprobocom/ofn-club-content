Members of the Lebanon Square Circlers joined in the fun of the Labor Day Weekend Campout at Frank and Marianne Cawrse farm. There were nine trailers and one tent camper. Besides having lots of good food and fellowship at the potlucks, they played croquet and other games, did some dancing and went on several hayrides. On Sunday late afternoon, Charlotte Jeskey called the dances from the heights of the silo. A great time was had by all.  

Summer is almost over so it's time to start our regular fall activities. Our first dance was on September 16 with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing. We celebrated with root beer floats.  

Our dance lessons will begin Sunday, September 17. To publicize our lessons, club members will present demonstration dancing at the Lebanon downtown Farmers Market on Thursday, September 14. See you in a square. Marilyn York
