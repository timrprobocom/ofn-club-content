I'm inclined to report that Willamette Squares have been hopping, skipping, and jumping through the summer, but it has been more like twirling, passing the ocean, and promenading around the squares! We have been having fun at every dance! 
Our latest dance was our watermelon dance where we had our fill of cool, refreshing watermelon. It was perfect summer refreshment while dancing. Thank goodness the square dance center is air-conditioned, but when dancers' internal temperatures rise, a slice of watermelon sure hits the spot! 
Depending on the number of plus dancers present, Willamette Squares has been offering a number of plus dances for those who have advanced beyond mainstream. We have had many plus dancers participate, and the feedback has been positive, so we are planning to continue with the opportunity. 
Willamette Squares held their quarterly business meeting at Newport Bay Restaurant in Salem. Besides enjoying exquisite cuisine, we took care of the business at hand. There was an announcement from Nancy and Brice Baker, that for health reasons, they can no longer maintain the level of club activity they have become so accustomed to and that they have come to a place where they feel they must resign. They have been longtime faithful members and through dedication and hard work have contributed wholeheartedly to our club's well being. We will miss them but not without sending them off with an appreciation/farewell party! 
Reminder: Willamette Squares is hosting lessons this fall starting in September. We look forward to a good turnout! Remember the first lesson is free. Jodee Howard
