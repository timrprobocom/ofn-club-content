Our dance season has begun and no one can remember ever canceling an opening dance, but that’s what we had to do. So our new season opener was September 16th with our annual Johnny Appleseed Dance.  Our October dances are Saturday the 7th and our Harvest Days Dance Oct 21st.  Please plan to join us as we dance and twirl to the talents of Jim Hattrick. We’ll be serving up Pumpkin goodies and treats at break. Remember our new format; Pre-rounds at 7 and Plus from 7:30-9:45. For those looking for lessons we started on Sept 11 with a start-up class beginning the first Monday of every month. Folks can start up every month and repeat the levels as many times as they want before advancing. Jim teaches Basic, Mainstream and Plus at every lesson. October is also Seaside Sashay month and we hope to see many of you there.  Please make a note on your calendars that Nov 4th we will be dark for the Royal Romp. If you’re a Plus dancer and want a really fine weekend of Plus, you won’t want to miss this one. Happy dancing everyone! We’ll look for YOU in a square!
