The Rogue Squares started their classes on September 11, with Phil Ramey, (Phil Billy) teaching. We had 5 students on our first night of class with a promise of 4 â€” 6 more on the 18th. Since this is written after only 1 class, we cannot say for sure how many beginners we had. The first five (5) lessons are free and we are hoping for a great turnout. The people who attended the first lesson were very happy and agreed wholeheartedly to come back.

As most clubs know, we need angels to help with the class. The Rogue Squares have teamed up with the Star Promenaders to encourage angels to come out to help. We are not charging the angels for helping. We ARE issuing "punch" cards to the angels. They need to attend 8 classes and get the card "punched" and the "full" card will entitle them to get into a regular dance at either the Stars or the Rogue Squares free.

There are also tentative plans in the works to encourage the new dancers to come back. Stay tuned for updates in future Circulators.

Our next dance is October 20. It is the "Ghouls & Goblins are out if force" dance with Lawrence Johnstone calling and Mary Nutt cuing. Since it is a Halloween dance, there will be a couple of prizes for costumes if you decide to wear one.
