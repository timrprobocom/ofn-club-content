Really had a good turnout for our birthday dance. We would like to thank all the dancers from all the clubs that came out to celebrate our 63 years. Thank you Terry and Sarge for a fun night.

We started our classes with over 10 students and every one had a good time.

Our next dance is our Fall Frolic dance on Saturday , October 21 with Mary Nutt cueing the rounds at 7 and Dean with the squares starting at 8.
