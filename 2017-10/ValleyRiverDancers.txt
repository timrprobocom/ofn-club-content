We had over 10 squares at our “Dance Under the Stars” in July, with great weather and fun was had by all. We had a guest caller with Randy for our Hawaiian Dance in August and some of our members are currently on the Alaska Cruise with the Dibble Cruisers.  We are praying for all those affected by fires, flooding and hurricanes across the US.  Keep dancing and enjoying the company of all the friends we make when we go to other clubs.  All clubs can use visitors and it takes all of us to keep this activity going. 
We started Mainstream lessons on September 12 and will be taking new dancers thru the end of the month. Hope to see you in a square real soon. Jan Amerson
