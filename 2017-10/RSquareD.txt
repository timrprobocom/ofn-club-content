On Saturday August 19th the Club met at Pat and Glenn Faires' lake home for our annual pot luck and monthly meeting.  The sun was shining on the lake, it was a beautiful afternoon.
 Our last dance of the summer was this past week, with a rousing 5 1/2 squares.  It was our back to school dance.  Nearly $300 of school supplies were donated to be given to a local area school.
 October and our annual Octoberfest will be upon us soon.  This event will be held at the Rose Valley Grange October 13th to 15th.  This is the second weekend in October a change from previous years.  Work is underway to improve the acoustics.
 Lessons start on October 18th.  Plus lessons will begin at 6:30 PM and beginning class will start at 7:30PM
 Hope to see you all in a square real soon.
