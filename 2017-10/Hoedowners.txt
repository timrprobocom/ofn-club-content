To say the month of August was a warm one was an understatement!  Luckily the Hoedowners were completely prepared with several summer activities.  We had so much fun on August 7th at our annual Hoedowner Hop’s Night!  The weather was lovely, the coppery sun was setting in the smoky haze and an amazing group of people were having fun.  Who could ask for more?  Well, perhaps the Hops could have won but 16 runs were knocked in, unfortunately the majority were for Vancouver.  It was one of those get togethers where you just have time to visit, catch up, laugh a lot and relax together.
 On the 12th of August we had our “Here’s the Scoop Dance” with guest caller Mike Stout and joining our own Randy Lewis calling was Julie Stout.  Thanks to all the Sunset Promenaders who joined us for our ice cream sundaes.  Sundaes are always popular but never more than when the temperature is warm.
 We were prepared for the 93 degree weather on the 26th for our “Cool and Sweet Dance” featuring fruit and melons.  We just have to remember the George R.R. Martin quote, “Summer will end soon enough.”
 We were very disappointed that the Hahn Barn Dance had to be cancelled on the 27th.  It is such a unique dance but dancing in the hay loft with the temperature at 97 would have been a challenge.  We’re waiting to hear when it will be rescheduled.  
 Summer will fade into fall so we’re hoping we’ll see you on October 14th for our “Oktoberfest Dance”.  We’ll be serving German foods which will melt the frost on your pumpkin.
 We’re going dark on October 28th for the Seaside Sashay.  Hope we see across the Square at the Seaside Convention Center!
