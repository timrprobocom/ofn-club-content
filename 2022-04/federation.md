#### United We Dance – 2022 Summer Festival	

Oregon’s Summer Festival is back!  Summer Festival will be July 15-17, at Blanchet Catholic School in Salem.  Blanchet is the perfect location.  When you take the Market Street Exit in Salem, the school is only a ½ mile from I-5, east of Lancaster Drive in the heart of the Mid-Willamette Valley.  It is about an hour from Portland or Eugene and within 2-4 hours for most of the rest of the state.  The school is close to restaurants, hotels, shopping, and gas stations.

For those who would like to stay in Salem during the festival, there are several hotels listed on the back of the festival registration form.  In addition, we have also listed a couple campgrounds.  If you wish to camp on-site, there will be limited dry camping for $10 per night, available starting Thursday afternoon.  Your rigs will be secure since the gates are locked every night at 10:30 pm.  There is another event in the area so hotels and campgrounds are filling up quickly.  Be sure to make your reservations as soon as you can.

Dancing will start in the school at 2:00 pm on Friday, July 15.  Blanchet has 2 beautiful large wooden gym floors where we will be dancing Plus with Rounds and Mainstream with Rounds.  We will also have a separate hall for Rounds and another hall for our Advanced dancers.  In order to protect their wooden gym floors from possible damage, cowboy boots or spike heels or heels that come to a point will not be allowed on the wood floors. No exceptions.  Boots and dance heels are allowed in the Round Dance Hall and Advanced Hall ONLY.

Summer Festival’s featured caller, Pat Carnathan, is from Menifee, California and started dancing with his parents in 1977.  He started calling in 1980 when his club held an amateur night.  Pat has been calling professionally since 1981 and now calls worldwide from Mainstream through A2.   Pat met his wife nearly 30 years ago and were married in 2008.  Pat has been teaching and calling for many years.  Pat’s bio is on the Summer Festival Webpage (www.2022.oregonsummerfestival.org) under the Callers Tab.
 
Summer Festival’s featured cuer is Oregon’s own Rikki Lobato from Grants Pass.  Rikki grew up watching her grandparents dance, but didn’t start dancing herself until 2011.  In 2017, Rikki obtained her RoundALab license so she could “just help friends” and before she knew it she was cueing.  She started teaching rounds immediately in the Fall of 2017.  Rikki has been traveling the states cueing with local and national callers.  She currently teaches in Roseburg and Grants Pass.  Rikki’s bio is on the Summer Festival Webpage under the Cuer Tab.

In addition to our featured caller and cuer, we will be enjoying the talents of many of our Oregon callers and cuers.  We are planning a complete dance program in all of the halls.  There will also be several workshops and teaching sessions available for your dancing pleasure.
