R Square D’s beginner’s class that started in January has 13 students and we are encouraged by this.  We are continuing plus lessons/workshops at 6:30 PM on Wednesday evenings (prior to the beginner’s class).  Our club caller, Craig Abercrombie, is in Arizona until early April, so Jim Hattrick is teaching our lessons while Craig is away.  
 Our 69th Anniversary dance is Friday, April 8th, with Craig calling and Susan Healea cueing.  Plus dancing and intermediate rounds start at 7:00, with mainstream and phase II rounds from 8-9:30.  We will be dark on April 23rd so that members may attend the Yakima Spring Sashay that weekend.
 R Square D dances at Kelso Senior Center, 108 NW 8th Ave, Kelso, WA.  We do not require proof of vaccination but face masks are currently required (face shields are not allowed in place of masks in WA State).  Hopefully, it will soon be safe enough to dance without masks!
