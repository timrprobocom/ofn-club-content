On February 25th Valley River Dancers held our Birthday Dance with cupcakes and ice cream to celebrate.  We were excited to have three squares in attendance.  
 We previously announced that our mainstream class for lessons had been postponed to the 2nd Tuesday in March.  That has again been postponed and will begin on the 2nd Tuesday of April.  If anyone is interested in Plus or Advanced lessons/workshops, please contact us through our Facebook page: Valley River Dancers - Newberg, and let us know so that we can plan for those following our mainstream lessons.  Mainstream lessons begin at 6:30 to 8 pm with either Plus or Advanced lessons to follow at 8:00 to 9:30 pm.  They will be held at the Newberg Chehalem Community Center and taught by Randy Dibble.
 Our up coming dances are:  Plus dance on April 8th at 7:30 pm for pre-rounds and 8:00 pm squares.  Mainstream dance on April 22nd at 7:30 pm for Pre-Plus and 8:00 pm Mainstream.  All dances are at the Newberg Chehalem Community Center with Randy Dibble as Caller and Leonard Snodgrass as Cuer.
 We are no longer requiring proof of vaccination for Covid for entry to the dances or lessons.  We will discontinue the requirement to wear masks in accordance with the state mandate for wearing masks indoors.  Please feel free to wear a mask if that makes you feel more comfortable.
