The Charter members of the M&M’s will always have a place in our hearts for the two square dance icons who have recently passed.  Janne Norton was a guest cuer for our young club in 1985 and soon became our Club Cuer from 1986-1992 and again from 2000 - 2003.  Dick Click was a guest caller for M&M'’s in 1988 and became our Club caller from 1989 - 1993.  He did a few dances for us as a “guest” up until 1999.  Oh, what fun we had with Dick and Janne!  They were so good at what they did; they made it look easy.  They were good people and as many of you,  we considered them friends.  We are so happy to have had them as a part of our square dance family.  They will certainly be missed but - - -  how can we not think of them and smile?
