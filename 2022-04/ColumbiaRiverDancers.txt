The CRD’s have had a good start this year.  We had our 7th anniversary, had two beginner’s dances and have a new class ready to go for our next beginner’s dance on April 24th.  I will report more on our Anniversary Dance next month.
 Our February 27th dance had five squares so things are starting to look a little more normal.  Jim Hattrick looks better and better all the time and continues to call and cue.
 As for now, we are continuing our lessons on Sundays and our Friday dances include our Spring Fling Dance on the April 1st, where we encourage everyone to think flowers and spring and dress accordingly.  Our April 15 dance will be a regular dance.
 Remember that we must all put on a happy face and enjoy the fun on dancing with friends you know and friends you meet anew.
