Our Valentineâ€™s Dance fell right on February 14th, and our dancers were a sea of red as they twirled around the dance floor.  This was also the first day of our Plus lessons, which were open to new students and dancers who wished to refresh their Plus skills.  Lessons are taught on alternating weeks by our regular club callers, Jim Hattrick and Darrell Kalmbach.
 Eager Beavers is looking forward to hosting our 47th Anniversary Dance on Monday, April 25th, featuring Callers Darrell Kalmbach and Jim Hattrick and Cuer Jeanine Norden.  We will have Mainstream and Rounds from 1:15 to 3:00, preceded by Pre-Plus with Level III Rounds from 12:45 to 1:15.  This is the one dance each year where we dance mainstream so that dancers who are not plus dancers may obtain a requirement for the TVC Ambassador Badge.  Cookies and social time will follow the dance.  As of this writing, we anticipate the mask mandate will still be lifted at the time of this dance, and we continue to require proof of vaccination for the safety of our members and guests.
 We dance every Monday.  For up to date information see our website at http://EagerBeavers.info.
