Classes are going well and we have 6 students. The students are dancing on Tuesdays for their regular class and they are also dancing on Thursdays from 630-8pm. The Plus workshop continues on Thursdays at 8pm.   We had an SSD dance last Friday and an impromptu dance on Saturday with about 30 dancers. Everyone was excited to be "mask-less" if they chose.
Our next SSD dance is Friday, April 1st.
Our dance this coming Saturday, March 19th will be lots of fun with guest caller J Domis and cuer Bob Dingman.  J is putting the word out and we are going to change it up a bit to have beginner and experienced tips. We hope lots of people will join us for the dance. If you haven't danced to J, he is a lot of fun!!! Pre Rounds at 7pm and Squares start at 730pm.  We will be dark for our Saturday, April 2nd dance to help the Buckeroo's celebrate their birthday! 
Boatnik is fast approaching and we are gearing up for a great festival!!  Get your ribbons soon to save money on the weekend!
We are happy to see everyone's smiling face and we hope to see more of you soon!
