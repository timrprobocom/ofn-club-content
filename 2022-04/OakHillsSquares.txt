The Oak Hills Squares continue to dance every Monday at the Oak Hills Gym on NW 153rd Ave, Beaverton.
 We currently have 9 new folks taking lessons from 6.30 â€“ 7.25pm.  After that we dance mainstream until 8.30pm.
 From April, on the first Monday of the month, we will be dancing mainstream from 7.30pm- 9pm.  We encourage everyone to come along and dance with us, we would love to have some visitors.
 Our fabulous caller is Mark Wheeler and he continues to guide, teach and entertain us every Monday.
 Following the changes to the mask mandate, we will no longer require masks to be worn.  However, we will remain a fully vaccinated only club and will require proof of vaccination for any new visitors.
 Please contact Linda Kitchin: linda@kitchinonline.com for any information about the club.
