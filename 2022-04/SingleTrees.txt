We held two dances in the months of February and March, Feb. 11  and 25,  March 11th and 25th.   The first dance in March featured K.C. Curtis as caller and Neil Koozer as cuer.  The second dance in March had Jim Hattrick and Jackie Gale.  As always, our dancers love to dance and will welcome all dancers to the Emerald Square Dance Center and hope to keep you coming back for more.  

We start off with 15 minutes of round dancing at 7:30PM and then do a plus tip at 7:45.  At 8PM we have mainstream with every third tip plus until 10PM.  Rounds are cued between every tip. 

Since the masking mandate was still in effect on March 11, masks and/or face shields were required and there was no shared food, but on March 25th masks became optional and our club members were encouraged to bring some food to share with our guests.  We were asking everyone to pay $8.00 at the door the past two month, but as we will drop back to one dance a month in April our door fee will return to $6.00 per person.

Our membership drive has begun and we hope our members will renew their membership and encourage friends to join our club as well.  Membership has fallen off but we are ever hopeful that new dancers will be out as well as perhaps some former members return.

Generally we have seen anywhere from 2 to 4 squares on the floor during the pandemic since we started up dancing again last May.  In time weâ€™d like to see the numbers increase as we all know that it creates a livelier, more enthusiastic crowd, but whether it is two or four the dancing is great and our callers and cuers are great too
In April we will have Scott Zinser caller for your dancing pleasure on the 4th Friday.  Connie Seaman, our caller coordinator, is hard at work on the dance calendar and has Jim Hattrick lined up for our next dance year.

See you in a square!
