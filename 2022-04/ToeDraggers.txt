We are back!  Our first dance will be held on April 15th.  KC (Linda) Curtis will call and Sandra Pinion will cue for us. 
 This first dance will be a workshop dance, to reintroduce our muscles to the art of square dancing again.
 Proof of vaccines will not be required, and if the mask mandate is lifted, masks won’t be required either. YAY!! I can breathe again!
 Please come to the Kinton Grange and dance with us! We are still just 5 ½ miles west of Washington Square, on Scholls Ferry Rd.
