Were there really four weeks in February this year?  They just blew by.  The Hoedowners held two dances, on February 12th with Craig Abercrombie and Randy Lewis and again on February 26th with K C Curtis and Randy Lewis.  Thank you to all who attended.
 Our round lessons have been progressing.  We’ve zipped through Two-step, Cha, Rumba and now learning that intoxicating rhythm S-l-o-w Two-step.  Connie Clark, with the patience of Job, has been teaching us.
 As for me and the rest of Hoedowners, we’re looking forward to the future!  Masks will no longer be required and Hoedowners are going to start scheduling all those fun social events we’re accustomed to; dinners, painting classes, movies, pinochle, games, sports, trips, and road-side cleanup whoo-hoo.  As they say in the TV business, we’ll be returning to regular programming.  
 Please join us for our regularly scheduled dances in April on the 9th and on the23rd. Masks and/or shields are optional.
 We Can Not Wait to See You!!
