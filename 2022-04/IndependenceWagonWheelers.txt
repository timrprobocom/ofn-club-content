The club celebrated their 62nd birthday dance with cupcakes and visitors. George and Patty did their thing and we had a fun time. The mask mandate was lifted a day earlier so we were hoping that would bring more dancers to the hall to celebrate with us.

Our cuer, Patty, had a birthday in early March. She is one special lady. Our Presidentâ€™s wife, Bonnie, is recovering from a heart procedure and is gaining strength week by week. She was to come back to the club at the March dance to visit. Leonard Goss, who has been ill with Covid for several months, has come back to dance a little while he gains his strength back also. 

Our next board meeting is in May, so stay tuned for news of lessons, more special dances, and whatever other news of value comes up. Marilyn
