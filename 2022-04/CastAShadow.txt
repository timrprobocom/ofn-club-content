We are still not dancing at this time, but that may change at any time since the masking mandate is being lifted.  Please check the website at cas-sd.yolasite.com to get an idea of when we might be dancing.  We generally dance one to two times a month on Sundays in Hall B of the Emerald Square Dance Center at 2095 Yolanda.  

Fred Beise, our coordinator and head honcho, will update the website as soon as he knows there are enough dancers interested in resuming advanced dancing in our area.  He will take a poll and then book the hall so what you see on the website is not the final word.  If you are not on Fredâ€™s email list and wish to be, please email him at fredbeisse@comcast.net .
