In March we graduated our class and now have 7 new members for our Club.  Craig Abercrombie returns in April and is back to calling for VS.  While Craig is away, Scott Zinser will fill in as our dance night caller.  Mark Wheeler and Jim Hattrick filled in as our class callers.  
 Our April dance is on the 16th with Craig calling and Connie Clark cueing.  We are planning ahead for our 73rd Anniversary dance on May 21st.  We are also planning visitations with our new members so they can get in more dancing, acquaint them with other Clubs and Callers and get to know the square dance community.  
 Hope to see you soon at one of our dances,
  Carolene Siebert
