We are sooo excited for the end of the Mask Mandate!!  Looking forward to seeing ALL the faces again. Masks and/or face shields may still be worn by anyone who feels they need to. The addition of food items at the dances will also be welcome.

We had our Annual Wear Red Dance on the first Friday in February. Fun dance. Our third Friday dance had four squares on the floor most of the evening. March 4 there were many dancers that we had not seen in quite a while. So nice to catch up with them.

March 19 was the Celebration of Life for our beloved Danny Rickard. His smile and enthusiasm will be missed by all of us.

April 15 is our 56th Birthday Dance. Come join us to celebrate. See you all on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
