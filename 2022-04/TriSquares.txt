Our club is on the move again!  Our board outlined some specific dates in April, May and June to have a few workshops for our members, then a few workshops open to everyone, and then a couple of dances!  But now we are waiting on contract negotiations with our grange, and of course with our caller Terry Halley and our cuer Sandra Pinion.  So it's not all firmed up yet completely, but we do have a skeleton plan in place to get dancing again!
