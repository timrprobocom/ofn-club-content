We had a great fundraiser dance. Thank you to everyone who attended and helped the kids. We had six squares on the floor and raised over $1,000 for the kids. The Country Cut-Ups had a visitation and received a banner.

Our new class has about 29 students, again with the majority being youth. We end the lessons each week with a session of line dancing.

Our Teen Square Up is past the initial planning and the "rules" have been sent out. If your club has youth who might be interested, please contact Karyn Buchheit for more details. Petrina Buchheit
