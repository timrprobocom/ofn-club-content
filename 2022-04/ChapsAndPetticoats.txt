March was a happening month for the Chaps and Petticoats.  Bill Sanford, our club President (& Cindy), announced they would be moving to WA (state) where Bill will manage the Rolling Bay Post Office.  We nominated Officers, on March 20th, and Ian Craig (& Kathleen) agreed to step into the President position.

Chaps and Petticoats were visited by the Portland Area Council on March 4th - Scott Zinser, called and Stephanie Lozano (& John) cued.  Three squares were on the floor (an increase of one square over our norm).

C&P had a square at the Silverton “Medieval” Fundraiser on March 6th.  Ian Craig (& Kathleen), Caller for the youth club, wore an aluminum foil vest of ‘silver’ and daggers at his hip - he was quite decked out in the era. Julia Buchheit was the Cuer - she danced, she cued and line-danced too.  The youth fundraiser was a success with over $1,000 raised and a rich six (6) squares on the floor.

On March 12th a handful of Chaps attended the Columbia River Dancers club.  Normally we cannot visit as their 1st and 3rd Fridays are the same nights that the Chaps dance.  Adam Christman called to six (6) squares and was their cuer, as well.  We had never been to the Manor Grange in Battleground, the floor was wonderful and dancing with no mask was liberating.

Perhaps you would care to join the Chaps on April 15th when Tom Klug will open with Rounds at 7:30pm (Deb, his wife and also a Caller, will accompany him from Central Oregon) and Ian Craig calls MS beginning at 8:00pm.  The Klugs have encouraged their Redrocks club to do a visitation that night - so please turn out and greet them at 7:30pm 

Chaps will dance the 1st and 3rd Friday’s on:   May 6th (opens PLUS with Zinser and Stephanie Lozano cues) and on May 20th, our theme is “Flags of Valor” with Darrell Kalmbach, Caller, and Dave Cooper (all the way from So. Coast Council) will cue.

See you in a square,
Betty Chipps
