The club is progressing well with Jive lessons for the early class. We have had as many as 11 couples, including angels, at lessons. That is great news for the activity. We hope it continues.

The later Waltz class is getting into the Phase 4 moves and they get more difficult each week. We are down to about four couples for that class which is better than none at all. We appreciate those who stay for the entire evening of dancing and lessons.
We had a Sunday afternoon dance on March 13 with a theme of Daylight Savings Time.

Since the mask mandate went away two days earlier, we were hoping that the dance center will allow the same. Stay tuned for a Facebook post showing our happy faces.

March brings dues time and seeing if anybody would like to run for an office in the club. Those currently in office have been there for about eight years. We must be doing something right. Nobody seems to want to print their name to volunteer to help run the club.
