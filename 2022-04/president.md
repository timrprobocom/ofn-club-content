It is said that April showers bring May flowers.  Here is hoping that, with the lifting of the indoor masking mandates, April showers will bring out more dancers. While many may still not be comfortable coming out and dancing, the fact that one may choose to wear a mask or not (no judgment) will make it easier.              

These last two years have been very hard on our activity. I am thankful for the callers, cuers and clubs that have persevered.  We have discovered more ways to keep in contact whether through Zoom meetings, facetime, e-mail and even texting.  Now let’s really get busy and support the smaller clubs that have been hit the hardest by this pandemic. Schedule an official visitation, call some friends and make a surprise visitation or, just go yourself and let them know you appreciate them. 
       
Hope to see you in a square soon and…..

Let’s Start Dancing Again
