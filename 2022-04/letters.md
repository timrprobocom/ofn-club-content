Howdy Dancers!

Please help us to promote our ‘Country Fever Dance & Campout Weekend’ with our great
friend and National Caller Jet Roberts from Owens Cross Roads, Alabama, and our delightful friend and cuer Dave Cooper from Southern Oregon Coast, with Jim Steele as MC for the weekend, here in our beautiful Central Oregon.

Does anyone remember back in 2003-2006 when we had ‘Dance Fever’ 50’s Theme here in Central Oregon? Well that was held at the La Pine Parks & Recreation Community Hall, which is where our Country Fever was held 2 years ago in May 2019, then with the COVID issues everything was shut down for nearly 2 years with no dancing, but now...we will be dancing and camping onsite at...

**Powell Butte Community Hall 8404 SW Reif Rd, Powell Butte, Oregon**

We’re bringing back all the FUN and Awesome dancing...
In a little different Theme and Flair...

Country Fever with a down home Country Style, Boots, Cowboy Hats, Lariat Ropes, but sorry the horses will have to be tied to the hitching post just outside the building! HaHa!

Please click on our pdf flyers here on the OFN site (under Advertisements) and help us to promote our super FUN dance & campout weekend with Jet Roberts & Dave Cooper along with Jim & Jan Steele putting this great weekend on for your dancing pleasure with your dancing friends! Help us by distributing our flyers to your club, council, and dance friends, to simply help to spread the word and hope that many of you dancers will join us for the dancing FUN filled weekend on...

**October 7-8-9, 2022 in Powell Butte, OR.**

Please see our dance schedule & pre-registration info on the back of the flyers for all the details.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us!

We’d be delighted to see you at our Country Fever Dance Weekend in Oct 7-8-9 2022!!
