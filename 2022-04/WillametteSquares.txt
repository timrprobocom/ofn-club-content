Willamette Squares is looking forward to their March dance. The theme is Spring Is in the Air. This will be Bruce Lowtherâ€™s first dance as our new caller.

Going forward, we plan to have a dance the fourth Saturday of every month. A reminder that our start time is now 7:00 P.M. for pre-rounds and 7:30 for mainstream. We hope to see you there! Jodee Howard
