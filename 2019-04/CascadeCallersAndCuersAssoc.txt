On March 30, 2019, the Emerald Empire Area Council and Cascade Callers and Cuers Association  put on a benefit dance for Camp Alma, the former Sheriffs work camp, in the Lorane area, which is being converted into a rehabilitation training area for veterans  This is one more way to thank and honor our veterans.
 
Our next scheduled 5th Saturday dance is June 29.
 
Keep on calling and cueing for fun!
