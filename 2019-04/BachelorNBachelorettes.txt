We dance every Wednesday when the temperature is between 33 and 90 degrees – which means we haven’t been dancing much lately.  I guess it give our club bookkeeper (Debbie Debit) a little break from the red ink, but club florist (Gerry Geranium) is wishing the weather would turn.

We’re pretty sure we will be dancing on our 54 anniversary dance on April 10.  Join us for lots of surprises.

So come on down and sashay with us.
