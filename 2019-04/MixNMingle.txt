This month's writing is a bit different from usual.  It's about our visitation to Valley River Squares, where we danced to our own caller, Randy Dibble.  We also had a chance to dance the rounds to Sherri Clark as she is now a local cuer.  
 We had hoped to retrieve our banner.  Unfortunately, three people who had planned to come were indisposed.  While we missed them, we had a good time dancing with some long time friends and made some new ones.  
 This will come out enough ahead of TVC's Fifth Friday dance at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro for everyone to be reminded in time.  We look forward to dancing to our favorite caller, Randy Dibble, and favorite cuer, Jeanine Norden March 30th, with every third tip plus.  
 Hope to see you there!
