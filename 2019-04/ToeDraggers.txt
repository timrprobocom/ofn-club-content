BRRR!  Baby its cold outside!  Well, one way to warm up is to come out and dance with the Toes. 
 We had several visitors to our Ducky Dance with lots of ducky themed treats and of course Dinky the HUGE blow up duck was there to MC.
 Looking ahead to the April activities, April 5th we are NOT at Kinton Grange, but will be dancing at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro. That dance will be all Gospel singing calls for our “Heavenly Hoedown” dance.
April 19th is “Hop on over for a good time” dance.
April 28th is our “Spring Celebration Ham Dinner & Bazaar at the Kinton Grange. The hours on this event are 12:00-4:00
 We hope to see you at one or all of these fun events.
