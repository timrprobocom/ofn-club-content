April 6th will be Valley Squares 70th Anniversary Dance, "The Crew" calling and Connie Clark cuing, 7- 8 pm Plus, 8-10 pm Mainstream.  Come help us celebrate our 70th!  
 April 20th dance;  Easter Egg Hunt with Scott Zinser calling, 7-8 pm Plus, 8-10 pm Mainstream.  We will be hiding eggs (plastic) with goodies inside for you to find.  
 Valley Squares Members want to thank Daryl Clendenin, Craig Abercrombie, Scott Zinser, Mark Wheeler and Connie Clark for calling and cuing for our Club in February and March.  We appreciate each of you.  
 A bit of Sunshine:  Bea Cook (who joined Valley Squares in 1973) fell and broke her hip bone.  And a retired, long time member Joe Thomas (he joined in 1974) fell and broke his upper leg.  Both are recovering nicely.  
 Our classes are coming along great.  We have 16 students who are having a great time, very energetic.  
 Yellowrock,
