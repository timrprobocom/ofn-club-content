The Tumbleweeds SD Club dances every Friday with our wonderful callers Daryl Clendenin and Jim Hattrick. 

Lessons start at 11:00am to 12:15pm.  PreRounds start at 12:15 to 12:30pm, then Mainstream from 12:30 to 2:00.

We need extra dancers to help with the lessons, so come help us and stay for the whole dance.  We love all of our visitors.  Lunch at 2:00.
