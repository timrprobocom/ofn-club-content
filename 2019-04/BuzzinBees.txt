Greetings from the Buzzin' Bees. We have had a busy couple of months. Our class of beginners graduated. We had our annual pie eating contest with the winner being Ethan. He will go on our plaque of winners. We had a visitation from the toe draggers and we made a visitation to the Oaky Doaks.

Our anniversary is coming up on April 20th. We dance at the Hazel Dell Grange and we start at 7pm with pre-rounds and squares at 7:30 with every third tip being plus. We hope to see you there.
