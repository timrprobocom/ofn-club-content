The Valley River Dancers dance Plus on 2nd Fridays, and Mainstream on 4th Fridays in Newberg at the Chehalem Community Center, located on the corner of 2nd and Howard Streets. 
 We have new cuers:   Ken Pratt cues 2nd Friday; Sherri Clark cues 4th Friday  
 A Cha Cha/Ph III Waltz workshop continues in April preceding the 2nd Friday dance (April 12th), led by Ken and Dianne Pratt, beginning at 6:30 pm.  If you want to brush up your round dancing, come on out! 
 It was much appreciated to have Darrell Kalmbach call our February Plus Dance while Randy Dibble and some of our members were away and on the Dibble Cruise.    We were visited by the Promenaders Plus who came to support the Kalmbach/Pratt duo, giving us 3 lively squares!   Our anniversary dance was also in February.   Randy Dibble called the dance and Sherri Clark cued her first dance for us.   We had club visitations from the Sunset Promenaders, who took a banner home with them, Mix and Mingle and the Toe Draggers, as well as guests from a number of other clubs.   A big thanks to all who made it out to help us celebrate.  We were happy to have 5 squares, especially in light of Tri-Squares having their annual Mardi Gras dance on the same night, which has historically been a well-attended dance.  
 Ian Craig called our Plus dance in March as Randy Dibble and some members were dancing in Kennewick.  We had 2 Squares.  Looking forward to better weather for safer travel for the area dances soon.
