<p>Oregon&rsquo;s 2019 Summer Festival will be July 19-21, at Blanchet Catholic School in Salem.&nbsp; Blanchet is the perfect location in the heart of the Willamette Valley. &nbsp;It is about an hour from Portland or Eugene, and only a couple of hours for most of the rest of the state. &nbsp;&nbsp;When you take the Market Street Exit in Salem, the school is only a &frac12; mile from I-5, east of Lancaster Drive. &nbsp;The school is close to restaurants, hotels, shopping, and gas stations.</p>
<p>We have discounted rates with three hotels in the area.&nbsp; The Shilo Inn (503-581-4001) and the Comfort Inn and Suites (503-588-0515) are 1 block west of I-5 on the Market Street Exit.&nbsp; The Comfort Suites&nbsp; (503-585-9705) is off the Mission Street Exit.&nbsp; There will be limited dry camping on-site for $10 per night, available starting Thursday afternoon. &nbsp;Your rigs will be secure; the gates are locked every night at 10:30 pm.&nbsp; If you require power and or water, there are several campgrounds on the internet, including Salem RV (503-364-5490) and Phoenix RV Park&nbsp; (503-581-2497).</p>

<p>A unique opportunity has been presented to us!</p>
<p>April marks the 35th anniversary of Pioneer Courthouse Square, often called "Portland's Living Room".&nbsp; In celebration of that milestone, the City of Portland has asked the Federation to put on a free square dance.&nbsp; This dance will be held in the Square at 11:30 on Friday, April 5.&nbsp; Leonard Snodgrass will be calling&nbsp;mainstream tips, and occasionally the onlookers will be invited to come join us for an introduction session.</p>
<p>All dancers in the area are invited to come on down and show the general public how much fun it is to "square it up".  The sponsors will be providing free cupcakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on the thumbnail above to get a printable flyer for this event.</p>
