Hello to all of you. As I write this, spring has NOT sprung yet and it is still cold outside. Old Man Winter seems to just want to hang on. I, personally, am done with him!
Our classes are doing well and the dancers are dancing more and more each week. Waltz is going well and we are adding more moves in the cha class as we get in to a few more of the difficult moves. We are still in the Phase 3-4 mode, but the lessons are going well. The later class put together a list of dances they would like to dance more and put the list down on paper. I donâ€™t know how many they came up with, but I am sure it will grow as the dancers think about the dances of the past that they liked.
We are working on having a small business meeting to vote for Federation officers, club officers, talking about our June birthday dance, and co-hosting the Fall Festival dance in September.
