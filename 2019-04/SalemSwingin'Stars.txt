Happy New Year. I know itâ€™s late, but lots of things have been happening with the Salem Swingin' Stars.  By the time you read this, we will have had our Annual Hobo Dance on the 15th of March. Such fun.  February was our Wear Red Dance and our Valentine's Dance.  We had a visitation from IWW as George Hermann was our guest caller that evening.  26 members of their club joined us and we had six squares on the floor.

April brings us our 53rd Birthday Dance on April 19, as well as the election of new officers. On April 28, which is a Sunday, Stars are hosting a special Memorial Dance for Manuel Machado.  Everyone is invited. There will be no cost for dancers. Please wear pink to honor Manuel.  Look for the flyer for more information.

Stars will be DARK on May 3 so we can all attend the Pacific Northwest Teen Festival in Silverton at the Silverton High School.  One of our very own club members will be dancing in the junior level.  Go Kailee!!
