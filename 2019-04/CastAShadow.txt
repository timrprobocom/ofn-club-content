Again Cast A Shadow was only able to hold one dance in February as the second had to be canceled, but it was a fun one!  We danced to recorded tips that Sunday, but we will have some live callers at least once a month starting April 14 with Dan Nordbye.  Our coordinator Fred and his wife Kathleen had the opportunity to dance to Danâ€™s calling down in Mesa in February.  I hope to do the same when I visit in March.  We are looking forward to seeing our snowbirds back with us starting in April to fill out our squares.  We miss you all!
 
The Cast A Shadow club dances normally twice a month, mostly to recorded music but often to a live caller as the opportunity presents itself.  Our dancers come from around the area and beyond.  We dance at the Emerald square Dance Center, 2095 Yolanda in Springfield, in Hall B (entrance on the far side of the building) and would love to have other advanced dancers come join us when they are in the area.  Right now no lessons are offered but if interest is shown that might be arranged.  Please visit our website for more information on upcoming acnes: www.cas-sd.yolasite.com or call 541-741-4149.
