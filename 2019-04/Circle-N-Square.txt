Greetings from Yreka,
This month's news will be short.

I assume by now most of you know the council dance was our final dance at Greenhorn Grange. I want to assure you our president myself and Sherrie are actively looking for a new venue for our dances. Please look at our fliers closely to see where the remaining  dances are being held. We may have to dance in several locations for a while until something suitable is found.  Feel free to contact myself, Sherrie, or our president for directions if you have any questions.

We are looking at many options for our club, and hope everyone will help and support us during this process.

Hope to see you on the floor

Dean
