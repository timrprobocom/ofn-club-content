Our April dances are scheduled for better weather I have been assured. Rain perhaps but no snow is forecast.  Our caller and cuer, Jim Hattrick, will be on the Hazel Dell Grange stage on the evening of the 13th.  Still recovering from his last mishap, a dislocated shoulder, he keeps the squares on their toes.
 We have waited until the 27th of April to have a Spring Fling.  We encourage everyone to wear bright spring colors. We will have Darrell Kalmbach calling for us that evening and Tami Helms cueing.  This should be a great dance as both of these folks are special to our club and to square dancers everywhere.
 Our dances start at 7 PM with an hour of Plus tips and Mainstream from 8PM till closing.
 Looking forward to an even bigger and better dance year.  Encourage your friends and neighbors to try it one time. It is nothing like they had in school years ago.  We start a new class at the first Tuesday of each month and since most classes are small we progress at the speed of the learners.
 See you on the floor.
