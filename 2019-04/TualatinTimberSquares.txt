At our dance on February 13th, the new dancer couple from the Toe Draggers came back and thoroughly enjoyed our dance.  Also, we gave a crash course in Mainstream to another new student who had just arrived at this dance.  I do not know whether he had square danced before, but he did really well with the moves that were taught him for the first time.
 Our dance on February 27th was cancelled due to the weather.
 Our dances in March are on the 13th and the 27th.
 Our 3RD ANNIVERSARY DANCE is coming!!!  It will be on Wednesday, April 24, at the Winona Grange in Tualatin.  7 to 9 p.m.  This will be a Basic Level dance with every third tip Mainstream.  Caller will be Janienne Alexander, and the cuer will be Sherri Clark.  And, there will be plenty of FOOD during this dance.  Save the date!!!
 We welcome all new dancers at all levels!  If any of our visiting new dancers have trouble with some of the moves, Janienne will gladly workshop the moves with the dancers.
 See you around in a square.
