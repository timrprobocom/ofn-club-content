Since the OFN is published mid month, you still have time to consider attending our next Council event, the Spring Fling Dance, held at the Hillsboro IOOF Hall on March 30th. This dance will feature Randy Dibble calling with Jeanine Norden cueing.  The dance begins with pre-rounds at 7:30 followed by Mainstream with rounds at 8:00.  Every third tip will be Plus.  This dance is co-hosted by the Mix N' Mingle.
 On May 19th a dance sponsored by Tualatin Valley Council & Portland Area Council will be held to benefit the Alzheimer’s Association.  All proceeds will go directly to them.  The Oak Grove Community Club is donating the hall and Caller MC Dan Nordbye with Cuer MC Julie Stiers are donating their time.  Alzheimer’s Association Benefit Dance May 19, 2019 2:00 - 5:00 p.m., Oak Grove Community Center, 14496 SE Cedar Avenue, Portland, OR.  Donations are welcome and tax deductible.
