March was another busy month with dances on the 2nd and 16th with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  March 16 was our St. Pattyâ€™s Dance with lots of green.  Then on the 30th we have our Super Mysterious Mystery Trip. It promises to be lots of fun. 

April 6 is our Hippie Dance with Charlotte and Jackie and the first Saturday in May will be our Cinco de Mayo Taco Dance.

We have already started preparations for our Strawberry Festival Dances and Weekend on May 31 - June 2.  As usual, RVs are welcome. We will have our Silent Auction, Experienced Clothing Sale, Spaghetti Feed on Friday night, potluck on Saturday night, and breakfast on Sunday morning. Of course, strawberry shortcake will be served at the Saturday night dance.  Dan Nordbye will be calling for our Saturday night dance and Jackie Gale will be cueing.  Mark your calendar to come and enjoy all the festivities. 

See you in a square!
