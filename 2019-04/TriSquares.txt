In February we held our annual anchor dance “the Mardi Gras Masquerade Ball” but we had fewer people attend this year, due to the cold weather and competition from other clubs on the same night.  Otherwise it was a great dance, called by Terry Halley and K.C. Curtis, with terrific costumes and prizes.  Also in February our Mainstream and Waltz classes continued.
 In April we plan to visit the Valley Squares for their 70th anniversary dance.  Also we will hold our annual election of new officers during a dinner in Dundee at La Sierra Mexican Grill, which has a great side room.  Tri Squares are planning two April dances:  “Pay It Forward” on Saturday, the 13th, when we will be collecting items for the Tigard Good Neighbor Center (for homeless families);  and “Grace Notes” on Friday, the 26th, which will have all gospel and singing calls.  Our caller and cuer for both dances will be Terry Halley and Sandra Pinion.  Hope you can join us!
