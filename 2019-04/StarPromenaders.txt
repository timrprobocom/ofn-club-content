The last “Game Night” was March 15th. What a lot of fun we had. Come out and join us. It is a “Hoot.” If you don’t play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on, or if there is some other “Game” you would like to play, let us know. We are open to most any table game. We always have a potluck with a theme. The next one will most likely be in June. There is a lot going on in April & May with Pear Blossom & Boatnik.

Phil Ramey has been doing a Mainstream/Plus Workshop on Wednesdays to give everyone who feels a little shaky about some moves, a chance to come out and practice. There are generally 2 squares plus. He is even throwing in a little bit of Advanced. Don’t worry, it is easy Advanced. Come on out and enjoy a fun evening and maybe learn something. There is a lot of laughter and we are having a ball.

At the March 23rd dance, we collected clean, plus stuffed animals to donate to the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department to give to children in stressful situations. Thanks to all who contributed. There was representation from the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department on hand to receive the animals & express their appreciation for this gesture.

Preparations for Diamond Lake Festival are coming along nicely. Everything seems to be right on schedule. Get your ribbons for a great time.
