Hi Everyone

Don’t forget the Council Dance on March 29th. It will be held in Yreka and will be the last square dance event held at the Greenhorn Grange. We would like to see a “HUGE” turnout to support this club and its dancers. Come on, gang, let’s GO TO Yreka. Dean Black is calling and Elaine Funk is cueing. Circle N Squares are Hosts for this dance, Charlie’s are Greeters and Stars are in charge of Door Prizes. The Council is Treasurer.

Don’t forget – on May 4th & 5th, the State Federation Meeting is in our Council. The May 4th Officer/Delegate meeting will be held at 2385 Table Rock Rd. The “Crock Pot” Potluck will be held from 5:45 to 6:30pm at the Rogue Valley Square Dance Ctr on Table Rock Rd. The May 5th meeting will be at the Rogue Valley Square Dance Center at 9:00am on Sunday. The clubs in the Council have sign up sheets for the crock pot dinners and other foods needed for the potluck. Check with your representative and sign up, or if you have a favorite Crock Pot meal, bring it along. There is never too much food. We will need main dishes, side dishes, salads and desserts.

The next Council meeting will be April 2nd at round Table Pizza in Poplar Square.
