The really bad weather in February seemed to be skirting around us, EXCEPT for the night of our second Friday dance which was to be our Valentine's dance.  It seemed prudent to cancel the dance due to the winter weather advisory.
 By the fourth Saturday we were eager to be dancing again, very few were left sitting on the sidelines and the floor was full!
 Plus dancers!  Here is something to plan for in April and May:  Plus lessons/workshop on Wednesday evenings 7 - 9.  There will be dancing for everyone.  Beginning April 10th through May 22nd.  The cost will be $2.50 per person.  We hope you will enjoy this opportunity.  Thank you Craig.
 In April don't  miss our first dance on Friday the 12th, this is our April Showers dance and the ONLY dance in April.  We will be dark for April 27th freeing you up to attend Salty Sashayers or Yakima Sashay.  We hope you will enjoy those dances then join us again the second Friday of May.
 Please remember that our dances are now ending at 9:30pm.  7-8 Plus and advanced rounds, 8-9:30pm Mainstream with rounds.  106 NW 8th, Kelso/Longview intersection on Ocean Beach Hwy.  Craig Abercrombie calling and Lonnie Sycks cueing.  Our website www.r-square-d.info is a great way to keep track of our club and events or friend us on Facebook.
