The Charlie's January Mainstream class is full of energy and excitement!! We have 20 students, with 18 under 25 yrs of age!!! They will complete their 2nd plateau on March 26th. We welcome everyone to join us as we celebrate their accomplishment. Our Thursday Funshops have been helping strengthen the dancing skills of Mainstream & Plus dancers.. They are open to any graduated dancer, so please join us when you can. 630pm is the Mainstream Funshop and 8pm is the Plus Funshop.
Our March dances were lots of fun. On the 2nd we had Phil-Billy and Rikki to entertain the dancers. We had 3 squares and it was a fun & enjoyable dance.  On the 16th we welcomed guest caller Richard Lane and cuer Bob Dingman for a wonderful evening of dancing enjoyment. There were 5 squares and we alternated Plus & Mainstream throughout the nite. We also enjoyed some advanced prior to pre-rounds. Richard is always fun and it's nice to have him a little closer now that he and Leslye live in Roseburg.
We are dark for our first dance in April. We will be visiting the Buckeroo's for their birthday dance. Guest caller will be Charlie Robertson from OK, who we all enjoyed dancing to at MidWinter. Cuer will be Rikki Lobato.  7pm for Plus/rounds.  There will also be a Camp DBD on Sunday with Charlie and this is a great opportunity to improve your skills in Advanced & Plus. 1pm for Advanced & 230 for Plus.  Our dance on April 20th will be at a special time due to other events happening at the Fairgrounds that evening.  Dancing starts at Noon and will go until 3pm. Chuck & Bob will be calling and cueing.  This will be a regular dance with the community invited to watch & participate.  
Planning is in full swing for Boatnik Memorial weekend. We are beyond excited to welcome Joe Saltel and TJ(Bruce) Chadd for the weekend party.  Be sure and get your ribbons before the price goes up.  Our June 15th dance will be very special; be on the lookout for flyers!!!
Happy Dancing!!
