What a month we have had here at the Buckeroo Barn! The winter storm that came through Douglas County left a mess! We had many members without power for multiple days. There are some folks in the community who have now been without power for nearly three weeks and still have no idea when it will get restored. I guess that is life in the country.

We had to cancel some events at the barn, but are now back to our regular schedule. We started a community game night a few months back and it has been a big success. We open the barn up to the Roseburg community and have games available for everyone.  Board games, card games, and even a game of Twister could be found. Everyone that showed up had a great time.

Rememberâ€¦ we are just a short drive south from the Portland area, so plan to join us in the near future. We dance the first and third Saturdays and always enjoy having visitors. We have members of all ages and are a family friendly club.

Keep dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
