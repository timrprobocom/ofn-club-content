We have a correction over the last club report: due to weather, we didn't actually hold our February birthday dance. So we will have cake at our March dance instead. 
We graduated our new dancer class! We had two students graduate at the end of February. They both went to Mid-Winter and as they are also youth, they are part of our competition team.
Competition practice has started. We are practicing on both Sunday and Tuesday evenings. Don Benson and Ian Craig are working with the teams on Sundays and Thomas Buchheit will be doing most of the Tuesday class. At least that is the plan for Tuesdays. We were so glad that Leonard Snodgrass was available to fill in for Thomas recently when Thomas got called into work unexpectedly. 
Mom (Karyn Buchheit) still has spots open for volunteers for the Teen Festival. If you are interested, please call or email her: 503-873-5241 or buchheitfarmkm@gmail.com   
Our fundraiser dance did ok. We had about three squares of dancers present. We had fun dancing to Leonard and Frances. Bruce Lowther, Judy Russell and Julia Buchheit all did guest spots. See you at a dance soon.
