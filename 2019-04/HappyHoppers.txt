February 16th was a lucky day for all the Happy Hopper members and guests attending our dance. How was it lucky?  It was the Hoppers’ first “Lucky Dance.”  What is a “Lucky Dance?”  It’s a dance at which members and guests are not asked to make the usual door donation, thus it is a free dance.   The dates of a “Lucky Dance” are random and known only to the Amundsons and the Chases, so no one knows when the next “Lucky Dance” will happen.  Perhaps the next time you visit our club we will have another “Lucky Dance.”  

     Speaking of “lucky,” the Hoppers have found something else to feel lucky about.  Although leaving the Square Dance Center was a sad day for our club, we have discovered that our new location has opened the door to a new group of dancers.  The location is in a part of Clark County where no square dance clubs were currently dancing.  Once the word got out in the area, we began attracting local people to our lessons.  They are especially enthusiastic, and we are feeling lucky to have them.

     Being in existence for 60 years is another “lucky” thing to celebrate.  On May 4th the Hoppers will celebrate their longevity with an anniversary dance.  It promises to be a unique and fun dance as the theme is a play on the words of the dance date, the fourth of May.  The decision was made to do a spoof on the Star Wars saying, “May the force be with you.”  Thus, the theme is “May the Fourth Be with You.”  Guests who enjoy dressing to a theme and wish to come in costume are invited to dress as their favorite Star Wars character.  Of course, square dance attire is always welcome.  So, mark your calendars and plan to come and enjoy a unique anniversary dance with us.
