August is a slow month for the club since we do not dance because of the Polk County Fair. But we will meet to have our Annual Meeting on the second Saturday to vote for officers, discuss the Federation By-Laws changes, celebrate some Honored Members, and discuss future dance ideas. 
	
Lessons will start on September 11 at 6:00 p.m. at the Salem Square Dance Center. George Hermann will be the instructor.
