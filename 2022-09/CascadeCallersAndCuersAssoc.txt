We had our Fifth Saturday Dance the end of July.  Not a large turnout, but it was fun.  Calling and cueing were Pat and Cherie Cox, Janet Geiger, Tim Matteson, Sandy Harris and Christina Corelli.  Cherie came via her wheelchair as she had foot surgery earlier.  We wish her a speedy recovery.  Sandy Harris came sporting a cane.  Gail Jackson, our treasurer, was unable to attend as she suffered a severe shoulder injury just days before.  We pray everyone heals up quickly.  

Lennie Ludiker (Sheila) retired this past year.  We wish him a good retirement to do what he wishes.  He is taking care of his wife Sheila who is undergoing a lot of physical therapy right now.

Royal Greenman, former caller and member of CCCA, passed away recently.  His late wife was Sharon Greenman.  Sharon passed away in 2019.  We keep their families in our thoughts and prayers.

Sandy Harris is teaching social square dancing starting August 20 at 4:30 on Saturdays at the Emerald Square Dance Center in Springfield.
  
Roger Putzler will teach mainstream lessons on Tuesdays starting October 4 at 7:00 and Plus at 8:30. 

Our next Fifth Saturday Dance is December 31, but that is usually asked for by a local club.  Can you believe it'll be 2023!  The Fifth Saturdays in 2023 include April 29, July 29, September 30, and December 30.  
 
Keep on calling and cueing!
