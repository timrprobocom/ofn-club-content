The Corvallis Squares club is planning to hold regular dances again, starting in September! Our dances are the second and fourth Saturdays, and usually are at the First Congregational church in Corvallis, our regular venue. Vaccination required, but masks optional. And — ta da! — we’re holding lessons again! Social Square Dance lessons with Sandy Harris will start Thursday, Sept. 29, 7 - 8:30 p.m. at the Corvallis Community Center (formerly called the Senior Center) and run through Dec. 22.
