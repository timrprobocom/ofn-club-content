Single Trees dances on the 4th Friday of every month except when festivals or holidays fall on that Friday or the 4th weekend.  For example, we opted to go dark in July again this year as Diamond Lake Festival would be in full swing.  In August we will dance on Aug. 26 with K. C Curtis calling and Jackie Gale cueing. We’re all looking forward to that dance.

In July we had our annual club picnic which we held at Suzanne Peterson’s lovely country property just outside Eugene off Seavey Loop Road.  No matter how hot it gets it stays nice and breezy under the huge shade trees on her property. We had over 20 members and some friends as well as one of our former callers, Dale Hornberger who was visiting in the area.  We all enjoyed the barbecued hamburgers and hotdogs supplied by the club and barbecued by our President Larry Reetz.  Besides eating and talking some enjoyed the hayrides Suzanne likes to give so we can see her 5 acres up close and in comfort.  Some opted to play croquet or the dog race game which our club treasurer Joy Pitts always brings.  We did not do any dancing this year.

We are looking forward to our 2022-23 dance year starting in September.  Jim Hattrick will do the calling on the 4th Fridays alongside Jackie Gale who’ll do the cueing. Do check our website at singletrees.blogspot.com for more information about our dance schedule.

We dance from 7:30 to 10:00PM starting with pre-rounds for 15 minutes, a plus tip and then mainstream tips with every 3rd tip plus until 10PM.

Hope to see you in a square soon, 
Gaynor Hintz
