July is just a blur in my memory bank.  We came down with Covid while in California and were largely absent the entire month, but the Hoedowners sashayed on without us.

On July 9th Hoedowners enjoyed the calling of Scott Zinser with Connie Clark cueing rounds and on July 23rd K.C. Curtis joined Randy Lewis on stage for an evening of square dance and rounds. 

The most exciting news is that our lessons for 2022 begin September 13th, Tuesday nights at 7 pm!  Are you feeling a little bit tentative on the dance floor because of reduced floor time??  We all are so come, bring those friends who are anxious to learn.  We love and need new dancers.  So, letâ€™s step up, brush up and get back in the swing of things.
