Lessons will start again on September 4th with the desire to have a beginner dance on the 25th.  The only restriction would be if it is so hot we can not hold a complete series of lessons during the month. 

The Columbia River Dancers will begin its fall dance calendar on September 2nd.  It is our back to school dance with Jim Hattrick calling and cueing.

Columbia River Dancers members walked in the Battle Ground parade this last month, promoting dancing and  healthy living.  We handed out over 120 brochures and over 100 business cards giving our dates for lessons and dances.  As of this writing it is too soon to tell of any response as we had to stop lessons because of the heat.

In the meantime, we have been visiting clubs in support of their dances.  It is fair to say that we were particularly looking for halls with air conditioning.  The weather is getting back to near normal so will start looking for more clubs to visit.  If we don't support each other we will all suffer. 

Hope to see you in a square soon, both at our dances and at yours.
