So far we have not had to cancel a dance due to low attendance.  Mostly only one square.  Our new club caller is Lane Clem with Terry Halley has been filling in when Lane is busy elsewhere.  Our dances are held weekly on Tuesdays from 5:30 to 7:30 at the Elks Lodge in Tillamook. We are using the hall upstairs.  It is a good idea to call before you make the trip to see if we have enough folks for a square.  For up to date information see: www.wavesteppers.org.
