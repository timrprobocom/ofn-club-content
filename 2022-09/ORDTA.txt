We held our summer meeting during Summer Festival in the round dance hall at Blanchet Catholic School. We welcomed a new member, Molly Fairly, gathered some dues money, and listened to a presentation about DanceWizard from Tim Keck. We heard updates from the Members at Large about dancing in their respective areas. Sounds like round dancing is doing well despite the pandemic. 

Sympathy cards had been sent to the families of Janne Norton, Ray Walz, and Joyce Brown. Our next meeting is scheduled for some time in October pending availability of the hall in Springfield.
