Whew, it's been so hot! Thank goodness the hall has air conditioning and fans to keep all the dancers cool while having fun on the dance floor. Our 5th Friday Plus dance on July 29 was hot, hot, hot outside but so cool and comfortable in the hall.

The first Friday dance in August had five squares of dancers and it was much cooler. ðŸ˜€ We will dance on the third Friday in August as well.

Get the word out, Mainstream Lessons begin on Wednesday, September 14 at 6:30 p.m. with instructor Randy Dibble. Free the first two weeks, $5.00 per dancer per week thereafter.

Mark your calendar for our Annual Corn â€˜n Cluck dance on September 16.

Thank you to all the dancers for coming out and supporting square dancing with us. See you on the dance floor.
