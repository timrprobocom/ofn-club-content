September 2022.  How did we get here so fast? Seems hard to believe that a year ago at this time, I was grappling with the fact that I have to put an article in the OFN and what I was going to say. Managed to do it and it seemed like each month it got a little easier figuring out what to say.  Now, this is my last one.

For the last few months, I have been talking about promoting classes and what we can do to get new students to help build our activity.  I got a little “wake-up” call in the last month. We need students and we need new dancers that is true, BUT we also are in great need of callers and teachers for these students.  I mean, what good is getting 30 or 40 students only to have no one to teach them??

Sadly, we do not have many callers here in the state anymore and a majority of those of us who are calling are over 70 years of age.  While we have a lot of experience (many of us have been calling since our 20’s or teens), who knows how much longer some of us will be willing or able to continue?  If you, or someone you know in your club, would be willing to learn to call, let your club caller know. All of us will be willing to help someone learn to call. We have two excellent caller teachers in this state in Daryl Clendenin and Roger Putzler. Daryl is also an accredited Caller Lab caller/coach. They both are great resources. 

We as dancers must also support anyone who would like to try and call.  Do not expect a person with a month’s experience to be as polished as someone who has been calling for 15, 20 or even 30 years. It is a process.  

Thank you again for a year of leading the OFSRDC. I have learned a lot. My only regret is I did not get to do what I wanted to do. I had plans to visit every club in Oregon during my term. But the COVID thing, MY calling schedule and my wife’s health did not allow that. I still…..
          
Hope to see you in a square soon and…..
