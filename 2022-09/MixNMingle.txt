Goodbye Summer -  Hello Fall -  and M&M’s have scheduled a dance for Sat. Sept 19th to start the season.  There COULD be a glitch with that date however so PLEASE check our website to confirm that we are indeed dancing on that night before heading to Winona Grange in Tualatin.  If it’s easier you can also call Lindie at 503-282-4414.  Our remaining 2022 calendar is a strange one with at least one “dark” dance night each month.  The randomness of our dancing is frustrating but we are doing our best with what comes our way.  Just keep our website (or Lindie’s phone number) handy so you can stay up to date.
 
We appreciate all of our very special “Regulars”, and Guests,  and thank them for hanging in there with us.

Lindie Noonan
