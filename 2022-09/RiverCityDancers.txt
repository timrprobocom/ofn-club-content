We have been enjoying dancing all summer every second and fourth Saturday in the comfort of our air-conditioned hall. We are looking forward to continuing in September.

September is lesson time for us. Square dance lessons start Sunday September 18, at 5:30  and go for an hour and a half each Sunday. Our round dance lessons will start October 2. The price of lessons is $60 for the first 12 lessons which is a savings, or $6 a lesson.

Other things happening in September are the state meeting September 17 and the PAC dance September 30. 

Keep your feet dancing.
