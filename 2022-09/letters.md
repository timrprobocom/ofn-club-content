The River City Riders, now proudly sponsored by the Country Cut-Ups of Boring, wish to announce their successful trail ride across the states to Evansville, Indiana, for the 71st National Square Dance Convention!  On their way, they stopped in Branson, MO, and took in two shows.  Their trail ride across the states to Evansville ended with three great performances.  Jolene's cousin and her hubby, Janice and Fred, dropped in from Illinois and recorded the second performance for YouTube.  Go check it out under "rivercityriders".

We would like to thank our 71st NSDC Exhibition Directors, Nadine Henry and Brenda Bolinger, for the excellent care they took to help us keep on track.

Thank you to the 71st NSDC for the joy of dancing once again!

Thank yous are due to Jolene & Ed Cummings (lead horses), Danny & Carol Williamsen, Young & Robert Lumsden, Laura Bonocorsi, Lois Manos, and Ron Rasmussen.

Our caller, Jim Hattrick, has provided our programs for the last 11 years and we say "thanks, Jim, you make it happen!"  Your excellence in calling comes through for us.  You rock!

Our next ride is to San Diego for the USAWest Square Dance Convention, August 17-20.  We perform Thursday 4:45 and Friday 6:50 in the Crystal Ballroom, and Saturday 4:30 in the Presidio Ballroom.

Coming events for us: R Square D Octoberfest, October 15 at 7:15 PM, and Seaside Sashay, October 22 at 6:45 PM.
