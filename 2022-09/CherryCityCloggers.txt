We just had our semi-annual meeting to plan for the remainder of the year. We will be doing our final demo for the season at the State Fair on September 3 around 12:00 p.m.  We are also gearing up for our introduction to clogging lessons to begin on September 20. This will be taught by Glee Johnson and for those who preregister the cost will be $50. More information can be found on our website, cherrycitycloggers.com. 

We are also preparing for election of officers in the fall. We have a committee putting together nominees for each office. They will be voted on in October and take over the position January 2023.
