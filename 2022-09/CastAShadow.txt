Our club continues to dance one to two times a month depending on the availability of the hall and dancers.  Please check our web site at cas-sd.yolasite.com for tentative dates.  In July we only danced once on the 4th Sunday after Diamond Lake Festival.  In August we hope to dance two timesâ€”Aug. 14 and the 28th and again in September on the 11th and 25th in Hall B from 1:30 to 3:30PM.  We dance to recorded tips by national callers.  Be sure to contact Fred Beisse for up to date information about our dances.

Please join us when you can,
