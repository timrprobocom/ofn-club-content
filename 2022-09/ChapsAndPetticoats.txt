WOW, September is a big month for the Chaps and Petticoats!  OUR very first dance of the new season is: Friday, Sept.16th, we will open with excitement when we host the Trails-In Dance (to the September STATE Federation Meetings) starting 7:30 PM at Maplewood Grange.  

A handful of Chaps and Petticoats went “Dancing under the Stars” in Newberg on July 22nd at the Les Schwab Tire Center & there were actually stars to be seen!   Darrell Kalmbach and Leonard Snodgrass thank you for a fun evening of at least four squares dancing with four Callers on the floor as well.

On July 29, PAC and River City Dancers co-hosted the 5th Friday dance and C & P dancers added to the fun.  Five squares, four callers and two cuers were also present. Thank you, RCD, for hosting a lively event!

Chaps and Petticoats will host, at Maplewood Grange, two FREE Introductory MS Lesson nights from 5-7 PM on September 11 and September 18.  We also hope to see you September 16th at our Trails-In Dance. 

Happy Feet,
