The July TVC meeting was officiated by Ursula Kuhn, TVC President, and held via Zoom.  There were 23 attendees, including George Hermann, president of the Oregon Federation. 

Dale Brabham of the TriSquares was voted to succeed Josie Rosenbury as the State Delegate in September.  The TVC is once again providing clubs financial help to promote lessons.  Member clubs may request reimbursement of up to $200 for costs incurred related to the advertising of square dance lessons.

It was decided at this meeting that the appointed position of Sunshine Chair would not continue since no one had stepped up to be our Sunshine person.  The duties of the TVCâ€™s Sunshine person will be lowered to the club level, which means that the clubs will be sending cards to their members who are not doing well.

The Council highly recommends that all TVC dancers attend the anniversary dances held by other member clubs.  This month we have the TriSquares having their anniversary dance at a new (for them) hall, the Kinton Grange on September 23rd.  Next month on October 1st, the Sunset Promenaders Anniversary Dance will be at the Hillsboro IOOF hall.  Although listed in the TVC Directory, the Wavesteppers will NOT be holding an Anniversary Dance on the 25th of September.

Since the OFN is published about the 20th of the month, you still have time to plan on attending the TVC's annual Hahn Barn Dance will be held on the afternoon of Sunday, August 21st at the Hahn Farm near Banks. The Potluck Picnic will be slightly different this year.  You need to bring your own meal and perhaps a dessert to share.  It begins at 3 pm near the pond below the Barn before the dance.  Round dancing, cued by Tami Helms begins at 4:30 followed by Darrell Kalmbach calling squares from 5 to 7pm.  Mainstream with every third tip plus.
