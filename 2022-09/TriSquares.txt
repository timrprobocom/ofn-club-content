July was fun as the TriSquares visited the River City Dancers and Valley River's "Dance Under the Stars."

In September we begin our own dances again, but at our new grange in KINTON.  Our first dance will be on September 9th, "Aloha! Welcome to our New Home!"  And our Anniversary Dance will be on September 23rd, "Celebrate Good Times!"

We hope you will join us, and our caller Terry Halley and cuer Sandra Pinion. (Please note -- our dances start 30 minutes earlier than before, now at 7:00pm.)

Also, in September our lessons finally begin again!  On Sunday afternoons starting September 11th, with Waltz Rounds at 2pm and B51 Mainstream at 3:30.  (Waltz is $70/adult for 10 weeks. B51 Mainstream is free for the first 2 weeks and $56 for the next 8 weeks.)  Our masking policy is this:  If the CDC recommends masking that week, Tri Squares will require it.  If they don't, then masking is optional.  We will have some extra masks if you forget yours.  Check our website before coming - We will keep it updated about masking.

In September we plan to visit the Chaps and Petticoats "Trails-In Dance."  Plus, we will have a booth advertising our KINTON lessons at the Tigard Farmers Market, on September 4th.
