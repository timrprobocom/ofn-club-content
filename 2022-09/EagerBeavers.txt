Eager Beavers and guests have been especially grateful for the air conditioning at the Aloha Grange during the hot days of summer.  Jim Hattrick was our caller and cuer for our 4th of July dance as well as on July 18th, and Darrell Kalmbach was caller on the 11th and 25th.  Jeanine Norden is our cuer, with Connie Clark filling in for her when needed.  We have been averaging three to four squares at our dances.

We dance Plus with Ph II and III Rounds every Monday afternoon from 1:00 to 3:00, including holidays, which means we will have a Labor Day Dance on Monday, September 5th.  Though most of our dancers are vaccinated, we currently do not require proof of vaccination and masks are optional.  For current information, please see our website at http://EagerBeavers.info.
