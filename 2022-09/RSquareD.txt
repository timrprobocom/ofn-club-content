R Square D will resume our regular schedule in September, which is the second Friday and fourth Saturday at Kelso Senior Center.  We’ve had a fun summer with ice cream served at all of our dances!  We very much appreciate the consistent support from our sister clubs and the great calling and cueing that has made these successful dances.

September 9th is our “Pajama Dance”.  Should be interesting to see what people wear to this dance, but at least we will be comfortable!  Craig Abercrombie is our caller and Susan Healea will cue this dance.

Craig will call and cue a Neil Diamond tribute dance on Saturday, September 24th.  Come prepared to sing along with Craig to your favorite songs!

Our dances start with plus and intermediate rounds at 7:00 PM and the mainstream dance is from 8:00 to 9:30. 

Lessons will start on September 7th so we are gearing up for this and promoting square dancing whenever we can.  Plus lessons will start at 6:30 PM and beginning lessons at 7:30 at Kelso Senior Center, 106 NW 8th Ave, Kelso, WA.
