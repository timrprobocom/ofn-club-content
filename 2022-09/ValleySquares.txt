We're still in the three digits heat wave when I write this.  Valley Squares was DARK for the Summer Festival, so no report on a dance in July.  We will be DARK for the OFSRDC dance on September 17th, hope to dance with you there.  On October 7th, Valley Squares will begin dancing twice a month, the 1st Friday and our usual 3rd Saturday of the month,  7-9:30 pm, Mainstream with every third tip Plus.  Craig Abercrombie will be calling for our October 7th dance and Mark Wheeler calling for our October 15th dance, Connie Clark will be cueing for both dances.  This will be Connie's 36th year as Valley Squares Cuer.  Thank you Connie, you are much appreciated. 

See you in a square, Yellowrock
