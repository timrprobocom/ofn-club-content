Julie and Mike Stout announced their retirement from cuing and calling effective in September.  We will be having a dance on September 3rd to honor them.  It will be a Hawaiian theme.  Please join us!

September 9th will be the club camp out at Wapiti RV Park near Lincoln City.  We always have a great time on our camping trips.  September 16th the club will be doing a visitation for the State Federation meeting at Maplewood Grange in Aurora.  September 17th will be our regular mainstream dance and the last dance that Mike Stout will be calling with Randy Lewis cuing.  Our club meeting will be on September 22nd at 7:30 via zoon.  Tom and Janice Sminia have been nominated for the annual 2023 Randall award.  They are very deserving of this award and we're all rooting for them!  For July, there was a red, white and blue dance on July 2nd .. a good time was had by all.  We went dark on July 16th to support the Summer Festival in Salem.  Our hall was rocking at the TVC 5th Saturday dance on July 30th. There were quite a few people from many clubs and had 4 squares going all night.
