The Oak Hills Squares continues to dance on Monday evenings 6.30-8.30pm.  Our new members have now graduated, and we are enjoying some dance time on Monday evenings as they gain experience and confidence.

We will be looking to go on some visitations and plan to go to a dance each month as a club.

New classes start on October 3rd, 6.30-7.30pm and we will take new dancers through October 17th.

We meet at the Oak Hills Gym on NW 153rd Ave, Beaverton 97006.  Our caller is the one and only Mark Wheeler.  We love to have visitors, so please consider stopping by on a Monday evening and joining us for some fun.
