We successfully hosted the Trails In dance for Summer Festival in July. We had 50 people in attendance and plenty of food on the goodies table. There were four squares on the floor most of the evening and a good sized round dance circle to make the evening a great time. Thank you to Randy Lewis for being the MC. We had some guest callers and cuers to help him out during the evening and a good-sized split the pot.

We continue to dance on Thursdays with the first Thursday in August being an ice cream dance to celebrate the end of the hot weather. We may talk about future lesson ideas during the 30-minute break as we eat ice cream. Time for some ideas to surface.

The club will sponsor Phase 2 Waltz lessons at 4:00 p.m. at the Salem Square Dance Center. The instructors will be Molly Fairly and Marilyn Schmit.
