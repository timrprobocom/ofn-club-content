The June TVC meeting was held via Zoom. We were saddened to learn that one of our former treasurers and good friend, Joanne Switzer, passed away on June 15th after a long battle with cancer. She will certainly be missed.  A discussion was held regarding our meetings throughout the coming months.  It was decided that we will continue the Zoom meetings until September.  This will continue to be discussed so that we can resume our meetings in person when everyone is comfortable with that.
 Several TVC clubs have not resumed dancing because of questions regarding masks or the requirement of being vaccinated.  Others, Hoedowners, Eager Beavers, Sunset Promenaders, Oak Hills Squares, Promenaders Plus, and Valley River Dancers are dancing now, most with restrictions, but with no after dance snacks.  Some clubs are asking attendees to bring their own drinks/water.  Toe Draggers are returning to dancing in September with no restrictions and will include theme dances and after dance snacks with visiting.  See individual club flyers for more information.  
 On SSD... Toe Draggers and Sunset Promenaders have both decided to NOT go with SSD. The two Plus clubs, M 'n M's and Eager Beavers have much the same opinion about it since it does not really apply to them....  they are both concerned about the transition from SSD to Plus.  TriSquares are planning to adopt SSD in their upcoming lessons.  Other TV clubs have not stated their intent.
