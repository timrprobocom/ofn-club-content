We are positively back to dancing again with gatherings being opened up without restrictions.  This could change at a moment’s notice, so follow the governor’s guidelines and be safe.  The Federation website has a full report on Covid 19 at the top of the web page.  Please review.

For those clubs that are dark during the summer, please plan on visitations to festivals and other clubs that are dancing.  Get back into the routine again.  A club picnic this summer would be good for socialization, too.  Gather together as a club and also make it happen for your council.  Being social is what we missed while sheltering in place.  Be safe in all activities that you are planning.

As I write, this the Federation has two more meetings this term.  One will have already taken place on Saturday, July 17th by Zoom.  On Sunday, September 12, 2021, we will meet in person for the change of officers.  Please ask for a report from your council delegate on these Federation meetings during your club meetings.

I hope you all are having a good summer and getting back to square and round dancing in our “new normal”.

Swing Your Partner!
