Corvallis Squares had a virtual meeting on June 28. It was great to have time to catch up with each other and talk about plans for the upcoming dance year. We all look forward to getting back to dancing in person!  We have reserved the dance floor at the First Congregational church for the second and fourth Saturdays starting Sept. 11 at 7:00 p.m. We have all the callers and cuers lined up. We need to verify closer to the date that the church will be open for group activities like dances. 

Our club is interested in hosting lessons in the fall, taught by Bruce Lowther. Bruce and one of our members will investigate the possibility of offering lessons in conjunction with Linn-Benton Community College as weâ€™ve done in the past. We discussed the pros and cons of offering social square dance lessons or mainstream lessons.
 
We are hoping to have an in-person gathering maybe in August to reconnect before our dance year. We are grateful to our presidents Jean Goul and Ken Corwin for hanging in there through a very unusual year. Wishing you all a relaxing last month of summer! Stay well! Karen
