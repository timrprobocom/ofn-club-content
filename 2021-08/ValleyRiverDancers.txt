Our first time back dancing since the Pandemic was outside on June 11th at the Dundee Billick Park under the covered area.  Randy Dibble called and Leonard Snodgrass was our cuer.  We had a great time and it was so good to be back dancing.  The June 25th dance which was also to be at the same location was canceled due to the extreme heat our area was experiencing. 
 The Dance Under the Stars dance on July 23rd will be held at the tennis courts by Renne Field on E. 6th Street, Newberg, Oregon.  It is our usual location for this dance and gives us a chance to introduce people to square and round dancing.  It will be Mainstream with Darrell Kalmbach as our guest caller and Leonard Snodgrass as cuer.  The 5th Friday Advanced Dance will be on July 31st at the Woodburn Estates auditorium at 7:oo pm.  Randy Dibble will be there to call.  We hope many will join us for these dances.  
 Our August dances will be August 15th for our Plus dance and August 23rd for our Mainstream dance with Randy Dibble as caller and Leonard Snodgrass as cuer.  Dancing begins at 7:30 pm at the Chehalem Community Center, 502 E 2nd St. Newberg, Oregon 97132.  The hall is air conditioned for pleasant summer weather dancing.  We hope to see everyone there.
