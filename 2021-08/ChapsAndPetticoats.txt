Chaps and Petticoats held an in-person meeting at the Maplewood Grange on June 27th - if the great member turnout is any indication, Square Dance is very much alive!

C & P will continue to be a MS Club, however, Social Square Dance (SSD) will be taught up-front so students can enjoy dancing with other clubs instructed in SSD.  In August, we will fundraise (as a food vendor), at the ‘Slice of Summer’ in Canby, OR on AUG 15 & AUG 29 - profits earned will support lessons.

We elected Sundays to be our Lesson nights.  We will host Dances every 1st and 3rd Fridays AND a Workshop/dance every third Sunday (after lessons).
- Lessons begin SUN, SEPT 12th. from 5-7pm, and each Sunday thereafter - the first 12 weeks will teach SSD moves then continue instruction thereafter in MS. 
- Beginning FRIDAY, SEPT 17th - Dances will be held each first and third FRIDAYs, 7:30-10pm..(Format will include student tips, MS, Plus and Rounds).  Door is Adults $7, youth $3 and family $20.

On SUN, SEPT 19th (after lessons), and every third SUN thereafter, a Workshops/dance from 7pm-9pm will give students floor time to dance what they have learned.

If you want to be entertained, come listen to the ‘Slice of Summer’ concerts at Wait Park in Canby beginning AUG 15th (bring a folding chair) and check out the Chaps and Petticoats food booth AUG 15th and AUG 29th - will serve hot-dogs and Italian Sodas.

Happy Feet,
Betty Chipps
