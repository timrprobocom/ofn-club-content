To welcome our fellow dancers back, we had a free dance on July 10. We had good turn out and it was nice to be with our square dance friends again. 

We will have only one dance in August (which will NOT be free). It will be Saturday August 14.  The dance will be from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM with no break. Darrell Kalmbach is our caller and Tami Helms is our cuer. Masks will be required for unvaccinated dancers. 

Our dance schedule will return to normal in September. The dances will be every second and third Saturday.at Milwaukie Community Club in Milwaukie.

Hope to see you in a square.
