The Oak Hills Squares held their first dance this year on June 28th, the hottest day in Oregon for years (about 112 degrees at the beginning of the dance). It was too hot to stand outside for long. The facility was in use for basketball when we arrived but was comfortable for our dance throughout. There are no problems with this facility to keep up with excess heat. George Clark kept us moving at a timely pace throughout the evening. He is new to working with Oak Hills Squares but will be welcome to our family. Our Club Caller, Lane Clem, did also attend this dance. Renee Ruud is our other Club Caller. 
 I think we did well considering we have been closed longer than some members have danced in our club. If you didn’t make this dance, you missed an event we never hope to repeat with the “hottest dance in town!” 
 We had ten members in attendance dancing. This dance was in memory of one of our charter members, Joanne Switzer, who we lost on June 15th.
 We will be dancing on Mondays from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm at the Recreation Center on 158th in Oak Hills area. Lane Clem is our Club Caller. We dance mainstream with some round dancing. We will have beginning classes in the fall which will occupy our first hour of dance.
