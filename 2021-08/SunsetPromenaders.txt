 Congratulations to Joyce Clark for being elected our president at our last club meeting!
 Thank you to Darrell Kalmbach and Tami Helms for calling and cueing our dances throughout the summer!  Darrell will be calling the mainstream and plus dances through August; Tami will cue most of the dances, with guest cuers filling in as needed. 
 The 2021 Seaside Sashay is still tentatively scheduled for October 22-23.  A final decision to go ahead with the festival will be made very soon.  The callers will be Ray Brendzy and Darrell Kalmbach, with Debbie Taylor as the cuer.  More information will be passed along as it becomes available. 
 The Sunset Promenaders and the Promenaders Plus are under no restrictions at this time.  Everyone is welcome to our dances.  Masks are not required but if you feel like you need to wear a mask that is fine too.  Our dances are the first and third Saturday for mainstream and first, third, and fifth Thursday of the month for the plus dances.  Sorry to say we are not supplying any food or drink at this time so bring your choice of drink and we will supply the fun.  If things change we will let you know.
  Mike St.Clair
