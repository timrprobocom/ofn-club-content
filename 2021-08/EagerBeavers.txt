As I write this report, the State is in a heat wave.  We had to cancel two dances due to high temperatures.  I certainly hope August is not so hot and we will dance every Monday at the Aloha Grange.  (1:00 pm to 3:00 pm)
 Several Eagers Beavers are dancing at the State Fair including me.  I will also be at the State Fair as part of The Beat Goes On Marching Band.  We usually make about two tours around the grounds every day.  If you are there please look for us.  You will hear us coming.
