I have to say June was busting out all over this year! The Hoedowners busted out the opening week, June 3-6 with a campout at the Silver Cove Resort in Washington State. Some Hoedowners came as day trippers, some in RV’s and some stayed in cabins.  It was a wonderful early summer getaway.  Thank you to Kelly McCaw and Chris Stover for finding, checking out and reserving the space for our group.  The bullfrogs serenaded us each evening and we enjoyed wonderful campfires, pinochle, ladder toss, jigsaw puzzles, games, leisurely walks, cocktails, and that special camaraderie that made it a happy Hoedowner weekend.  Oh, I would not want to forget to mention all our adventures with the pizza oven.  Fresh dough or premade? You will have to ask.
 Then by golly, it was time to transition to our regular, traditional square dancing on June 10th.  Thank you to all who came despite all the graduation and wedding celebrations.  All those on the floor made it abundantly clear that they are ready to dance, dance, dance.
 Mother Nature decided to remind us not to be complacent.  Our June 26th dance was cancelled due to weather. Weather cancellation in June?  Unheard of since the Grange installed air conditioning.  Alas, the air conditioning was not equipped to handle the record breaking 108-degree day but then, who was?  It is a “non-dance” everyone will remember. 
 As we head into the rest of the summer, I hope you will join us as we resume our traditional dance calendar, dances on the 2nd and 4th Saturdays at the air-conditioned Aloha Grange; August 14th, Dan Nordby, August 28th, Mark Wheeler
