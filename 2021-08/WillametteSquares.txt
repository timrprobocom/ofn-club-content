After what seems like forever, Willamette Squares held their first dance since the pandemic. Despite the heat wave, the turnout was exceptionally good with three and one-half squares and up to five or six clubs represented.Â Sandy Harris called, and Judy Russell cued. The air conditioning provided cool air, so everyone was comfortable. It was so good to reunite with other dancers that we have missed seeing and to be out on the dance floor once again. 

Willamette Squares plans to continue with its dances every fourth Saturday at the Salem Square Dance Center, beginning at 7:00 p.m. and ending at 9:30 p.m. Please take special note of the time change from what it used to be: it will now be 7:00 till 9:30!  We hope to see you in a square. Jodee Howard
