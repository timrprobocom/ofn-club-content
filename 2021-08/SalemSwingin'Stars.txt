Salem Swingin' Stars are dancing our regular schedule of the first, third and fifth Fridays. We dance at the Salem Dance Center in an air-conditioned hall all summer long. July brings a 5th Friday Plus Dance on July 30.  We are busy planning for a memorable Corn & Cluck Dance in September.

We are also planning to begin Mainstream lessons on Wednesday September 8. It is so nice to be able to dance again and be together. Hopefully, food will be added to the lineup once again but for now, individually wrapped snacks are great.

We hope you will all join us in congratulating Randy Lewis who has been chosen to be our Club Cuer. Welcome to the Salem Swingin' Stars, Randy!! See you on the dance floor. Sheila
