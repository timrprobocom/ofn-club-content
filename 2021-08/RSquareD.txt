R Square D has little to report at this time. In April a decision was made to cancel this yearâ€™s Octoberfest weekend, but we plan to hold it in 2022!  A July club meeting/picnic is planned and it is expected that decisions will be made regarding when to resume hosting dances and lessons.  Kelso Senior Center, our dance venue, will also make decisions about reopening at their July board meeting, based on Washington State restrictions being lifted on July 1st.  We wish all our square dance friends a healthy and happy August!
