Dear Fellow Dancers!
Golden Squares is going to start back up on Monday, August 2. This will be our anniversary dance and is a Pajama Party dance. 

We dance first, third and fifth Mondays at the Woodburn Estates Auditorium, 1776 Country Club Rd. in Woodburn from 7:00 p.m. until 9:30 p.m.  We have Pre-rounds followed by Mainstream and every third tip is Plus. We have air conditioning and a nice wood floor. Randy Dibble is our caller, Julie Stiers cues on the first and fifth Mondays and Sherri Clark cues on our third Mondays. The fifth Mondays are Pie Nights and great homemade pies are served. This month has a fifth Monday so we hope you can join us for pie and ice-cream. We really need to have a good turnout.  We are low in membership and will not be able to support ourselves for too much longer if we cannot build up our attendance.  Please come check us out. Thank you, Teija Danskey
