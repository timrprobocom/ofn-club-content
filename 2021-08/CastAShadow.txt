We are back to dancing although we have only been able to hold one dance so far.  Our second dance June 27 had to be canceled due to the unexpectedly high temperatures that weekend.  While the hall has good air conditioning, it is doubtful that it would have been able to cope well with 111 degrees. 

We are all happy to be back doing advanced in Hall at the Emerald Square Dance Center.  We dance from 1:30 to 3:30PM on a couple of Sundays a month depending on schedules and weather.  Be sure to call someone or check the website to see if we are dancing on any given Sunday.  You can also call Gaynor at (541) 7414149 or Fred Beisse at 458-221-3564 (cell).  Our website is hyyps://cas-sd.yolasite.com.

We hope to have a dance on July 18 and then possibly July 25, Aug. 15 and Aug. 29.

Fred Beisse always chooses very good recorded material for us to dance to unless we manage to get a live caller passing through like Kris Jensen or Dan Nordbye.

Those dancing right now have all been vaccinated and we are requesting only those vaccinated participate at this time.  Also for the time being we are asking that no food be brought to be shared.  Please provide your own drinks and snacks.  Thank you.

Happy dancing, everyone!   
Gaynor Hintz
