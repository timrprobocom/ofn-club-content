Hope you are having a fun summer and practicing your dance moves.  We canceled our June round dance due to excessive heat and no a/c in the Barn.  Please know that if it is over 90 degrees outside it is safe to assume we are canceled, but feel free to check before traveling:  luvrounddancing@gmail.com  

We moved our round dances from 4th Fridays to 3rd Fridays from here on out in hopes of accommodating dancers who want to come dance with us on Friday and stay over to dance with the Buckaroos (and sometimes Timber 8s) on Saturday.
