At our June board meeting we came up with a tentative plan to hold four workshops - for our own members only - on Sunday afternoons in September/October.  These might be followed by a first-dance open to everyone on Friday, October 8th.  This all depends on how the pandemic is going at that time.  And at our July and August board meetings we will pin down more details.  We did reserve our club's annual potluck picnic in Sherwood's Snyder Park on August 22nd - so here's hoping the summer brings no more heat-domes!
