Where has the time gone this summer? Time is flying and it will be time to get 
classes going soon.
We are doing West Coast Swing for the summer, and everyone seems to be 
doing OK. Randy was gone for a week in July while he and Debbie went to ICBDA in 
Kingston, Tennessee. We had a guest cuer with Leonard Snodgrass.
We are in the discussion part of putting together an easy rumba or cha class to 
start one hour before our regular class/dance time on Thurdays. Hoping to have a 
decision before the end of July.
Come see us and have a relaxing couple of hours dancing at intermediate level 
rounds
