Toe Draggers are having our meetings in person, Hooray! Toe’s sent out a questionnaire about how we would like to proceed with getting back to the dance floor to all the members. The results came back as follows: dances would resume as we left off, with potlucks and theme dances. Caller &Cuer will stop and review moves when they see issues. Hand sanitizer will be available. It was also agreed that the Toe’s would not be embracing the SSD format at this time.
 We hope to see you at our Berry Happy 46th Anniversary on September 17th. KC Curtis & Darrell Kalmbach will be calling & Connie Clark will be cueing.
