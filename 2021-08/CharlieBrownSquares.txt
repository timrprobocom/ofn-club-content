The Charlie’s had a fun dance last Saturday July 17th with Chuck and Sarge calling and cueing for the nite. Thanks to the 2 1/2 squares and 6 or so round dance couples for the support!! FunShops continue thru the end of the month on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We will be dark in August for the Josephine County Fair. We are looking forward to starting classes back up in September and using the SSD program. 
Some Charlie’s will be headed to Diamond Lake to enjoy a fun festival with Mike Haworth calling and Christina Corelli cueing. Always a fun festival!!
We look forward to seeing everyone on the dance floor soon.
