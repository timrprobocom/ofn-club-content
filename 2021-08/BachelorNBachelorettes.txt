We’re back to dancing our pre-pandemic schedule, with as many dancers as we had before.  As we get more stabilized, we’ll be able to go on visitations.

Surprisingly, on our first dance, we had more problems with the cues than with the squares.  Others comment that our club is well known for very seasoned dancers – those who have danced for many years, and not likely to forget the choreographies.

Our club has nothing against the new SSD format; however, we haven’t graduated a class in two years, and our clientele is used to mainstream or higher.
