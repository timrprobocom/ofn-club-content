YES, we are having a Fifth Saturday dance, July 31, 2021.  Casual dress as it's summer.  7 - 9 P.M. Dance will be fairly easy as a lot of us haven't danced in over a year.  There will be rounds in between tips with no formal break.  We dance at the square dance center at 2095 Yolanda in Springfield.  We have air conditioning.  Right now we are not doing shared food. Dancers please bring your own water.  Open to all dancers with unvaccinated dancers to please wear masks.  

We aim to please!
