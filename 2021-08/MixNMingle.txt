M&Mâ€™s are still holding Sept 18, 2021 as their start up date -  hopeful that the doors of Winona Grange can finally open up again.  We can hardly wait to get back to dancing with Randy, Jeanine and to seeing the rest of the M&M gang.  Please continue to check our website, http://mixandminglesquares.org/, for any updates or changes.  (Just 49 more days - - and counting)
