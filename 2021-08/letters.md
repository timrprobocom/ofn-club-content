title: Let us Celebrate the Old Timer Callers in Oregon
---
An “Old Timer” is defined by Oxford Language as “a person who has had the same job, membership, or residence, etc. for a long time”.  I would argue that being a square dance caller for over 50 years qualifies that individual as an Old Timer in our Square Dance community; a nickname well earned.

As a square dance community, where would we be without our callers?  Our community wouldn’t exist, would it?  As dancers we rely on our callers, without them, who’s there to tell us to square thru or spin the top?!  In a lot of ways, they’re the glue holding our community together!  Don’t get me wrong, dancers, club, council and state officers are also very important to our square dance community, but I’d like to focus on some of Oregon’s world-class callers for a hot minute.  In particular I’d like to shine the spotlight on those Oregon callers who have been calling and supporting our community for over fifty years.  

Callerlab and the American Callers Association (ACA) have recognized eleven (11) individuals who have been Square Dance Callers for over fifty (50) years.  
* Ralph Lambert (1966)
* Dan Nordbye (1967)
* Wayne Weaver (1968)
* Craig Abercrombie (1969)
* Daryl Clendenin (1969)
* Bob Tallman (1969)
* Dean Black (1970)
* Darrell Kalmbach (1970)

In addition to those callers in the 50-year club above, Oregon has three (3) callers who have joined the 60-year club!  These three, dare I say “Super” Old Timers, are the among the most experienced callers in the nation.  
* Jim Hattrick (1959)
* Roger Putzler (1959)
* Jim Steele (1959/60)

And as an honorable mention, Randy Dibble has been calling for 47 years.  

Hopefully you are familiar with most if not all of these Old Timers.  As a fairly new ‘retread’ dancer, I know I’m familiar with most of the names on this list and have had the pleasure of being in a square while one or more of these Old Timer’s was doing their thing on the stage!  And one of them even taught me to dance, not just once, but twice.  If you are not familiar with any of the individuals listed, I encourage you to seek out a dance with these very talented callers.  It will no doubt be a treat! 
These Old Timers have put extraordinary time and effort into our community.  They have progressively developed their craft and continue to do so with changes to programs for more than a half century.  Some have taken their talent to a national stage or even a global stage.  Some have volunteered for festival committees, national convention committees, club officer, council officer or state officer responsibilities in addition to their caller responsibilities.  And some have also became Round Dance Cuers.          

So as we all get back to this Square Dance Community that we love so much, remember to thank the Old Timer callers when you see them for their longevity, hard work, patience, and service to the Square Dancers of Oregon!  They deserve our appreciation.
