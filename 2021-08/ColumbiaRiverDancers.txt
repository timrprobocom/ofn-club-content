The Hazel Dell Grange has no air conditioning, and even though it is a great place to dance, in August’s hot weather it means we are dark.  BUT, there is hope on the horizon.  The club, through Melissa James’ efforts, has callers lined up for the fall.  Jim Hattrick is resting and getting stronger and is looking forward to our first dance in September.  
 Next month I will hopefully be able to tell you when new lessons will begin both for square and round dancing.  In the meantime look for one of the clubs that are dancing.  
I urge everyone to get their Covid shot so we can dance without a mask.
