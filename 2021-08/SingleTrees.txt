We have hosted two dances so far this year and by the time you read this article, we will have had a third one July 16 with Terry Halley calling and Jackie Gale, cueing.  We know that everyone will have had a great time because the two previous dances showed a lot of happy faces!  We are thankful to all our many visitors who have come so far to dance with us, and we hope they will continue to do so.  So far we have had three squares of dancers on the floor for the mainstream portion of the dance and two for the first half hour from 7:30 to 8PM which is always at the plus level.  Jackie Gale, our cuer, always does a great job of cueing and keeps the floor full.  Her husband, Bill, recuperating from heart surgery, often accompanies her to the dance  

George Hermann called our June 25 dance and his wife Patty cued as Jackie was unable to be there. 

We were so happy to have them both and appreciate their willingness to travel so far to call and cue for us.

Our next dance will be on the 4th Friday, Aug. 27 with Darrell Kalmbach calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  We will have a Hawaiian Luau for the theme of this dance as it is summer after all.  We also are hoping by then we can have food on the break bar (no formal breaks scheduled). 

We are looking forward to a new dance season starting in September when we will be dancing on the 4th Fridays with Jim Hattrick calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  We are hoping as more and more people get vaccinated and we see less and less of the dreadful COVID-19 virus running amuck that we will see more of our local dancers out to join us.  New lessons will begin on Tuesdays at 7PM with Roger Putzler teaching on his new knee after replacement surgery in July.  So happy to see things are returning to normal!

See you in a square,
