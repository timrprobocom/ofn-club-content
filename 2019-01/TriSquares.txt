On November 4th we held a terrific “New Dancer Jamboree” with eight squares!  Thanks to everyone for your support!  On the 10th we held a “Grateful Harvest Pie Party” dance, and on our second dance night, the day after Thanksgiving, we were dark to allow more family time for everyone.  
 On January 6th our club resumes Sunday afternoon lessons, at 2:00 for Waltz with Sherri Clark and at 3:30 for B52-B68 with Terry Halley.
 Due to Mid-Winter Festival we have only one dance in January on the 12th, “Cowboy Country” (Western attire appreciated but optional) with Terry Halley calling his best country music and Sandra Pinion cuing.  Our dances begin with Rounds at 7:30 followed by Plus at 7:45, Mainstream at 8:00 with the fourth tip Plus, and refreshments at 10 pm.
