Our Fall Mainstream Class is about to graduate. The class members are dancing with more skill, confidence, and flair every week. They all did great at their first New Dancer Dance on November 25.  We are very proud of them and are eager to show them off at Mid-Winter. Well done, George Hermann, club caller and mainstream class instructor! And hats off to our IWW Membership Chair, Dave O’Neil, for an excellent job of organizing and coordinating the fall lessons. Also, many thanks to Salem Hospital for allowing us to hold our classes at the hospital.
Our dance on December 8 was our Annual Christmas Dance and Silent Auction. The auction was a success permitting us to make a substantial contribution to Windsor House, our club’s chosen charity. To add to the excitement, our Christmas Dance was a New Dancer Dance. We had a good turnout of new dancers who obviously were thrilled to be dancing at a real square dance. George did his usual superb job of calling. The dancers responded with happy and enthusiastic dancing. Welcome, new dancers, to the square dance community!

Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays of each month at Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall. Especially be sure to come to our special March 9 IWW Birthday Dance and April 13 Easter Dance. 

We hope that you’ve had a blessed and peace-filled Christmas season, and wish you a happy, healthy, and dance-filled New Year. Dee and Bert Mackaman
