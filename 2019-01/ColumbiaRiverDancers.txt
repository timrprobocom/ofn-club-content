What a year for the Columbia River Dancers.  Overall it was a very good year.  Our club had growth, even though small in numbers, yet great in dancing desire.  We were forced to go dark too many times this last summer because of the heat.  To that end we are probably going to go dark this coming summer.  The Grange just gets too hot to really enjoy dancing.  We were dark for the Seaside Sashay and one weekend as the area cloggers took over the grange for their annual event.  We had visitations from a variety of clubs and look forward of visiting them back.  We had a great time at the Sashay and are planning to return in bigger numbers this year.
 The square dance community also lost a great lady with the passing of Dorothy Louder this past year.  She was a good teacher, good cuer and a just nice lady to know.
 But on to this coming month.  Our January 12th Pajama Dance will feature Craig Abercrombie calling and Julie Stiers cueing.  What a way to welcome in 2019.  We will be dark on the 26th of January as we will be supporting the Mid-Winter Festival in Albany.  Look us up and square up a tip with us.
 One thing that our club prides itself on is we make every attempt possible that everyone gets to dance.  So if you are a single, do not let that stop you from coming.
