<div>
<p><img class="right" src="content/2019-01/Kincaid.jpg" /></p>
<p>James Leonard Kinkaid (Jim) was born October 15, 1934 in Pasco, Washington to Leonard and Mary Corrine Kinkaid. The family moved to the Willamette Valley in 1936 and settled in West Salem on a dairy farm in 1943. Jim attended Brush College Grade School and graduated from Salem High School in 1952 where he was an FFA member. After high school, Jim went to Oregon State College (University) and graduated in 1956 with a degree in Animal Husbandry and then joined the Air Force for 3 years of Service.<br /><br />On June 18, 1954 Jim and Margaret "Avis" Dezotell were married in First Christian Church in downtown Salem and later welcomed their first daughter, Debbie. In 1959, after Jim's discharge from the Air Force the family moved back to West Salem and Jim and his Dad, Leonard, formed a partnership on the dairy farm that remained in the family until 1985. Second daughter, Linda, was born during this time.<br /><br />While on the dairy, Jim was involved in many dairy organizations and served on the board of directors for Select Sires and All West Breeders. Jim was also involved in Church activities that included working with the Youth Groups and helping to take care of the Church property. Jim and Avis belonged to the Red Hots Square Dance Club for over 30 years and danced both locally and throughout the region.<br /><br />In 1985 the dairy was sold and a new adventure raising onions was started in the Lake Labish area and continued until Jim and Avis retired in 1997. Jim continued his involvement with the Church as a Deacon and on the Property committee seeing what needed to be done and getting it done often without fanfare. He was a promoter of agriculture and willing to show people how it used to be done with antique farm equipment at AgFest and Western Antique Powerland in Brooks.<br /><br />Jim passed away November 16, 2018 to join his wife of over 63 years who passed away in March 2018.
