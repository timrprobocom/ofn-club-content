We had our council meeting Nov 19.  All club presidents were urged to attend for input; unfortunately, only about a third showed up.

The big star of the evening was Kathy Roberts, in charge of Publicity and Education, on the Oregon Federation board.  She challenged us about being a cheerleader for our council and member clubs, challenging them with a big smile and enthusiasm.  And when necessary, being good hosts for out of town callers and cuers.  She then reminded us that the whole purpose of councils is to support our clubs, callers and cuers.  We could use more callers and cuers, so she reminded us that the Federation has scholarships for our callers and cuers.  She made a pitch for our clubs to co-host a council dance with our council, wherein the club does the work and the council pays for the hall.  Profits could be split.  She concluded about the importance of flyers and that she could make them if necessary, posting them on Facebook, and also encouraged us to attend the Education Seminar at Mid-Winter.
