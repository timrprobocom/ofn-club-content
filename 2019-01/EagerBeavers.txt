November is a stressful month; elections, time change from ST to DST, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and planning for December Holidays.  Thank goodness we have the antidote.  We dance!  No medicine beats stress as well as dancing.  
 Welcome in the New Year with the Eager Beavers and Sunset Promenaders at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro from 9PM to 12:15AM.  Both Mainstream and Plus will be included at the dance.  The TVC is providing crockpot foods and dancers supply a variety of finger foods during open break. Donation $8.00.  See flyer at EagerBeavers.info.  
 We will again be offering our popular Plus classes starting February 4th at noon to 1:15PM. Brush up your plus skills or start new.  Either way you will have fun.   See lesson flyer below, our regular dance starts at 1:15 right after lessons.
 Even if you work on Mondays, you can join us once in a while; we dance every Monday afternoon, even on holidays except Christmas and New Years.  Our callers keep us on our toes as each week, always seeming to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  We dance from 1:00 to 3:00 pm at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
