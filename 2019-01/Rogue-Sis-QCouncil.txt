Another reminder, the Council has taken sponsorship of the "Pajamarama" on January 11, 2019. This will become an annual "New Dancer" dance. The Callers & Cuers sponsor "New Dancer" dances in December and February, so this should be an excellent fit and give the newbies one more arena to practice their newly learned skill. We are also thinking about sponsoring a few more "New Dancer" dances for the students. They need all the help they can get, as we all did at this stage of learning.

The Council will be sponsoring the Federation Meeting on May 4th & 5th, 2019 and looks forward to welcoming the State Delegates and dancers!!

There were lots of "Holiday" dances and get-together's in December and they were all fun filled & GREAT.

The next Council meeting will be February 5, 2019 at Round Table Pizza in Medford.
