The first MWA New Dancerâ€™s Dance for the season was held on November 25 at the Salem Square Dance Center, hosted by the Braids and Braves. Seven or eight squares filled the floor all afternoon, with a total of close to 100 dancers in attendance. The caller instructors are doing a super job as we saw very few breakdowns. A fun time was had by all.
