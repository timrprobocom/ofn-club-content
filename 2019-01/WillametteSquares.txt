November’s dance consisted of the turkey Dance. Despite the foggy weather, we were blessed with a sizeable turnout, and everyone enjoyed a night of dancing and comradery. A special treat was the calling and cueing by Sandy Harris and her “sister” Jackie Gale.
We are looking forward to our Christmas Dance and hope to have you all with us to celebrate the season though dance! Please note that in January Willamette Squares will go dark as our regularly scheduled dance night conflicts with the Mid Winter Festival. Our new dancer’s dance will be forthcoming in the new year at the Salem Square dance Center on January 16. Please join us then for a fun time of dancing. Steve Hoots for Jodee Howard
