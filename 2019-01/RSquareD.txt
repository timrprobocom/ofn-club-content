November turns our thoughts to holiday activities.  Beginning with our Veterans Day dance we honored 14 veterans.  Our Saturday dance after thanksgiving was also a good turnout 4+ squares.  Craig was calling, Susan Healea filled in for rounds, the floor was full.
 We will dance into the new year with the first and only January dance.  On the 11th, our Snowflake Frolic dance we serve warm soups. The soups have been something to look forward to, and of course all of us at R Square D.  Come let us welcome you into the new year.  We are dark January 26th so dancers can attend Mid-Winter in Albany.  Happy New Year to all from R Square D.
 R Square D dances at 106 NW 8th, Kelso/Longview WA.  Our website www.r-square-d.info is a great way to keep track of our club and events or friend us on Facebook.  Our caller is Craig Abercrombie and our cuer is Lonnie Sycks, 7-8 Plus and advanced rounds, 8-10 Mainstream with rounds
