The holidays are almost over and the New Year approaches.  Wouldn’t it be great to continue this same joy and fellowship throughout the New Year 2019?  Most of us snuggled up in front of the fireplace (or woodstove) enjoying what so many do not have.  We have so much to be thankful for.

Recently I received a message informing me that club membership is down in several clubs and what was I going to do about it.  I must say it’s not just club membership that is decreasing, but dancers in general are reducing in numbers as we get older and the younger generation have better things to do than square dance.  It’s not my fault, your fault, or anyone else’s fault. It’s just a fact that many groups are having to find new ideas to combat the diminishing numbers. We can all remember when the numbers at any dance was over 100, state festivals were in the thousands, and National Conventions had higher numbers of dancers.  I was recently looking at a directory from 1976 where Rogue Sis Q Council had 13 clubs on it’s roster, now we have 3 clubs. We can all remember when, but that’s not going to help today or tomorrow.

What do we do?  Brainstorm for new ideas, and ways to encourage others to join this wonderful activity? Maybe have a little more tolerance for those who don’t dance as well, give them time to perfect their moves, encourage instead of discourage the new dancer.  We all started as beginners once.  Remember those trending fashion frenzies when we were young? Start accepting the fashion frenzies of the current young uns and let them dance.  Whatever we do, we need to maintain tolerance, patience, and enjoy what we do with anyone who wishes to participate.

Recently I read an article about the history of Square dancing.  It mentioned that square dancing is uniquely American. The numbers died down with urbanization and the dance was left behind and almost forgotten.  Then it was built back up by finding ways to encourage new dancers to participate.  The early 1900’s brought square dancing back into existence.  We need to find ways to build it back up again.  Let’s get together and share ideas.

Oregon has square dance clubs in several cities, towns, and are within driving distance for anyone.  Get out and support the clubs and councils.  And remember that old saying “Square Dancing is friendship set to music”, this isn’t a new concept.
