We recently elected Marcia Eblen as our new President & Lynne Hetherington as Treasurer. We are still in need of a VP & Secretary. Congrats to our new officers. Our club is small, but has a wonderful heart!! We welcomed our newest dancer Janie, who has been attending classes & is doing great!!
It looks like our annual Gold Diggers dance may be moved to the 2nd Saturday of June due to a conflict with 3 national callers in Grants Pass on the 3rd Saturday. We have tentatively booked Lawrence Johnstone for the 2019 dance, a cuer has yet to be hired.  This will be a great opportunity to come down and dance to a local favorite & then dance to the 3 callers the following weekend.  
Our December party night was fun for all. We continued a tradition started by Linda Hayes of a fun ornament exchange.
We will be dark for the rest of 2018.
We will be offering new dancer lessons. January 7, 14, 21 (Mondays) for anyone interested. Those nights are free to new dancers.
I want to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas & Happy New Year & hope you will mark your calendar for our party nights.
Dean
