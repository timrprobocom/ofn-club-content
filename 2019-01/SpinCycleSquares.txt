We continue to dance Sunday nights from 5:30 - 8:00 at all levels with our competent caller and teacher, Tim Matteson.  We encourage dancers to come and dance with us and get more floor time.  Please call our president, David Lajoie at 541-520-7311 or Tim at 541-988-0399 to make sure we are dancing as we go dark once in a blue moon.  We don't want to miss you.  Our dances/classes are always casual.  We always have a lot of food too.  Come for a fun evening almost every Sunday!

We were so lucky to have Kris Jensen, national caller from Albuquerque call for us two weeks in a row.  Kris and Kurt's mom lives in Eugene.  Kris called for Cast-a-Shadow, our advanced club and even called a Challenge tip.  She's good!

Come join us Sunday evenings for FUN, fellowship, dancing and FOOD.  We do have lots of food.  And, it's warm in our hall which has a cushioned wood floor.

Happy Dancing,
