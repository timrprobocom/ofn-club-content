Classes are still at a status quo. There are a couple of students who are former dancers and are refreshing the activity and having a ball. On Thursday, Dec 20, the class hosted their annual Christmas Potluck. There was even a visit from Santa Claus. As always, it was free to all dancers.

Monday Plus class is going great. There are only a couple more moves to learn and they will be done with classes. On Monday, January 14, 2019, we will start a a Beginner Class. Come on out from 630 to 830pm to angel and help the students learn how great Square Dancing is. We have a great time. Phil is a lot of fun.

The next "Game Night" will be January 18th. What alot of fun we have.

Wayne's Advanced Class on Wednesdays is over until April when he and Debbi get back from their travels. In it's place, Phil will be doing a Mainstream/Plus workshop to give everyone who feels a little shaky about some moves, a chance to come out & practice.  Come out and enjoy a fun evening & maybe learn something!

A lot of the Stars went to Grants Pass to dance on December 1st for the Charlie's Birthday Dance. It was great fun dancing to Mike Kellogg & MaryAnn Callahan. They are quite a team!

Don't forget the Stars' Birthday Dance is on February 23, 2019 and the caller is Ed Kremers from Magalia, CA. The cuer will be our own Elaine Funk. It should be a great evening.

Eight chain four, no five, no six - oh well
See you in a square
