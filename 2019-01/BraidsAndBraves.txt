We had two squares plus several others talking in the chairs for our Turkey shuffle and Trophy Dance. We had visitors from Sunset Promenaders and some independent dancers. Bruce Lowther called and Sandra Pinion cued. Timber Twirlers won the trophy for largest percentage of their club in attendance. 

We had a very successful New Dancerâ€™s Dance on November 25 and are looking forward to our Christmas Dance in December. Happy Holidays to all. Carmen
