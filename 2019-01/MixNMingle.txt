This will be published as 2018 waves goodbye to a year when we had many events to celebrate and people to thank.
 First, of course, we want to thank Randy Dibble and Jeanine Norden for the high quality of each dance and for their upbeat personalities, always working to make each dance special.
 In 2018, for the first time, we had workshops.  The summer heat skipped our dance nights.  Supporters, long time friends, and newer ones kept up the attendance.  We thank each and every one of you who came.
 We welcome each of you at our dances.  Each of you is a value supporter who helps to make our dances such fun.  Those who bring snacks are among the most faithful supporters.  Those who encourage others to come to our dances brighten the evening for all of us.
 We thank all of you who walk in with a smile, ready for an enjoyable evening with friendly folks.  We thank Winona Grange for offering a dance location at a reasonable cost that is easy to get to.
