Wolf Pack is still struggling. We had 2 theme dances lately. One was a spaghetti dinner dance but hardly anyone came.

Dec. 1st we had our Christmas dance and bake sale with barely a square in attendance.

I sincerely hope that we can keep afloat but with everything going out and not much coming in the future is looking pretty bleak.

We have fun even when no one comes, but if you would join us, it would brighten our dances.
