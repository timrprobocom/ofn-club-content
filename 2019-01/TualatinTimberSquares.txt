Plus lessons are continuing and going quite well.  Basic Lessons will start January 2nd and open to the community.  Advertising has already begun at the recent Chic Closet fair with a buy one get one free pass for a single night.  We are encouraged by the interest from our community and blessed with the help of our Angels.  Do you have new dancers who need extra time on the floor?  They are welcome to join us during class.
