We only had one dance in the month of November having decided earlier this year to go dark on the Friday following Thanksgiving due to poor turnout in previous years.  Our Veterans Remembrance Dance was fairly well attended with three to four squares on the floor for Jim Hattrick’s calling and a full floor of round dancers for Jackie Gale’s cueing.  As always Jim and Jackie did a great job for us.  There were many wearing red, white and blue with 12 veterans in attendance who were able to dance free of charge that night in honor of their service for our country.  My thanks to Becky Lemler who took the photo of the group during the dance (photo available in the photo section).

The next night several Single Tree members attending the Turkey Dance in Sweet Home.  We got a double dose of Jim Hattrick and Jackie Gale that weekend.  While the numbers were down from previous years there was still a good crowd of happy dancers who enjoyed the fine turkey dinner with all the trimmings.  It was fun getting to visit a little with all the dancers we don’t get to see except perhaps at Mid-Winter.

One Dec. 1st Single Trees combined with Whirl-A-Ways to visit the Independence Wagon Wheelers in Rickreall.  What a fun dance!  Perhaps because of the Christmas season neither club could muster a square so no banners were gathered.  Still we had a good time and enjoyed George Hermann’s calling as well as his grandson Mike Kious.  The photo of the visitation group can be seen in the photo section.
