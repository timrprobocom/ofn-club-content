The Hayshakers had two fun-filled dances in November with Craig Abercrombie calling on the 3rd Friday and Janienne Alexander calling on the 5th Friday.
 The Hayshakers have three visitations planned for December.  We’ll visit the Columbia River Dancers in Vancouver’s Hazel Dell Grange on Saturday the 8th, the Happy Hoppers in Vancouver’s Washington Grange on Saturday the 15th, and then back to the Hazel Dell Grange to rejoin the Columbia River Dancers for their Starry Night New Year’s Eve Dance.
