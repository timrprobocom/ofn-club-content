December was quite a month for the Hoppers.  We had a successful toy drive for the Children’s Center.  The Hoppers and guests were very generous with the number of gifts donated.  Someone even made an anonymous $110 cash donation.  By the time this is published our club will have made a visitation to the Country Cut-Ups on December 29th.  Their club visited us in November when we were just getting settled in our new home.  As anyone who has moved knows, it is not always clear where everything gets packed away.  So, when it came time to present the Cut-Ups with one of our visitation banners it was a case of, “Oops! We can’t find our banner!”  Our co-president, Ron Chase, offered them a temporary Happy Hopper paper napkin, but our fabulous caller, Jim Hattrick got up and generously took off the vest he was wearing and presented it to the Cut-Ups.  So in addition to enjoying a dance at the Boring Barn with the Cut-Ups, we are in a quest to retrieve the vest for our amazing caller who has probably been shivering in this cold weather without his vest.  (Could this be a case of someone literally giving up the shirt off his back, or should I say the vest off his back?)

The Happy Hoppers will be busy gearing up for Mid-Winter during the month of January. Not only do we enjoy dancing to some terrific local and national callers and cuers, but we also appreciate the time we have to renew friendships with dancers we may see only at special events.  We’re looking forward to seeing many of you there.
