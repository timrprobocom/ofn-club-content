The Ramblers are thrilled to announce that we will be starting another series of Mainstream dance lessons, beginning January 16, 2019. We will continue to offer our lessons at the Bridgeport United Church of Christ, 621 NE 76th Ave., Portland. The church is located just a couple of blocks from Trimet’s bus line 19. The lessons run from 7-8:30 pm. We welcome all dancers—and we have snacks!

Our February 9 dance at the Milwaukie Grange will feature the world-famous Anne Uebelacker calling. We alternate Mainstream and Plus from 7:30 to 9:30 pm.

We will be DARK in March, as our club ventures north to Seattle for the Puddletown Squares Rain Festival (https://puddletownsquares.org/rain-festival-fly-in/).

SYIAS!
