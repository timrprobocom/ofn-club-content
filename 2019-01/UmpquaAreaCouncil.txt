Are your new dancers excited but a little nervous about 2019 MidWinter? If you have been dancing for a long time can you remember how you could hardly wait for MidWinter but that you did not “mess up a square?” We have a New Dancer Dance
scheduled 2:00-4:30 pm on Sunday afternoon January 13th,  so if you are within driving distance of Roseburg, think about loading up your car with some dancers and coming to our dance at the Buckeroo Barn. All calls will be at the New Dancer Level. And of course, all dancers are welcome. It’s a chance for the new dancers to dance at a new dancer level and a chance for everyone to come out and have an afternoon of dancing. Come and have fun with us. See our flyer or give us a
call for more info.
