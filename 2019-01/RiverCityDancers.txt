Our club was dark on December 8, because we were having new ceiling tiles installed in our hall.  Now our ceiling will look much nicer and I expect that it will improve the good sound that we already had. Come dance with us and check it out.

We rang in the new year with our New Years Eve Dance which was themed “Around The World In 80 Days”.  It had an international flair with catered  Chinese  food for dinner. Dan Nordbye called and Julie Steirs cued.

We will end the month of January with a club visitation to Midwinter Festival . Look for us wearing our blue and white club outfits on Saturday evening.

Come dance with us any second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community Center and you will be warmly welcomed.
