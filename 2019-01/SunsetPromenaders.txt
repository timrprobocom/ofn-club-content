We hosted the Annual Seaside Sashay Festival at the Convention Center and it was a success again this year with over 200 dancers.  There was a good group of our Sunset Promenaders at the Festival.
 In November our theme for the month was “Giving Thanks”, in December the theme was “Christmas” and for both months we had a non-perishable food drive which we give to the Food Bank to distribute to the less fortunate.
 Our January dances schedule is:
 • Thursday January 3rd Promenaders Plus dance with Darrell Kalmbach and Ken Pratt calling and cueing.
 • Saturday January 5th Sunset Promenaders mainstream dance with Mike Stout and Ken Pratt calling and cueing.  The dance theme is “Wild West”, with chili and cornbread at the break.
 • Thursday January 17th Promenaders Plus dance.
 • Saturday January 19th Mainstream dance with a theme of “Pajamas Dance”.
 • Thursday January 31st Promenaders Plus dance.
 Our Club wants to wish all the dancers in Oregon a very Happy New Year, and we are hoping this whole year will be great for us all.
 We start our square dance lessons in January and we are working to get our advertisements organized and hopefully get some new students.  The last couple of years we have grown our membership and hope to continue that trend.  If you or any of your friends want to take lessons in January on Sunday afternoon from 4:00 until 6:00 at our hall which is the Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall. There is good parking on the street or in the bank parking lot across the street.  
 If you have questions please call 503-848-3841 and we will try to answer them.
