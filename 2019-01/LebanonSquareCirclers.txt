What a busy month December has been. The Lebanon Square Circlers had its New Dancer Dance on December 1 with eight squares on the floor. It was also our Toy Dance with everyone bringing an unwrapped toy for our local Fire Department Christmas Toy Drive. Visiting callers and cuers helped to make this dance very special.  We will have our Christmas Dance on December 15.
   
On Sunday, January 20, 2019, the Lebanon Square Circlers will celebrate 70 years of dancing. We are the second oldest club in Oregon, so we are planning a GREAT TIME IN LEBANON. Dancing will begin at 2:00 PM with guest caller, Jim Voll and Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing. There will be special prizes, a balloon event and strawberry shortcake at break time. We are hoping that many dancers will be there to celebrate with us. 

Our new dancers have enjoyed all the new dancer events and are looking forward to Mid-Winter. They will graduate after our Birthday Dance. Hope to see you all at our Birthday Dance! Marilyn York
