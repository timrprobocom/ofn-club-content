Thank you to everyone who attended both of our dances in December, our regular dance and then our new dancerâ€™s dance. We enjoyed dancing to all of the callers and cuers present.

Thomas is active again as our visitation chair and is working on a visitation list. He is also trying to track down where all of our banners are.

Mom (Karyn Buchheit} is working on the volunteer list for the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival. She has a lot of positions to fill so if you want to help out for a shift or two, let her know. See you at a dance soon. Petrina Buchheit
