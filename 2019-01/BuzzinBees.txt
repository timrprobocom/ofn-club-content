Greetings from the Buzzin'  Bees. Happy New Year to you all. December was a busy month for us. We had our annual senior appreciation dance on December 1st and took in a healthy amount of donations of lap blankets, socks, toiletries, puzzle books, pens, shampoos and lotions that we then distribute to two assisted facilities that serve primarily low-income seniors. The activity directors then use what we donated as Christmas gifts for the residents so everyone gets to unwrap a gift on Christmas. On December 15th we had our first silent auction at our Christmas dance. Lessons are going well and our new dancer Jamboree will be on January 5th at the Hazel Dell Grange. That dance is also our pajama dance so come in your pjs. We encourage all new dancers to come and have some fun. Our club is looking forward to midwinter in January.

Just as a reminder, we are a mainstream Club but every third tip is plus. We dance with pre rounds at 7 p.m. on the first Saturday of the month and pre-plus on the 3rd Saturday of the month. We meet at the Hazel Dell Grange. Our dances start at 7. Our caller is KC Curtis and our cuer is Lonnie Sykes. Our next club meeting is 1 / 19 / 19. See you in a square!
