I hope you've made plans to attend the New Years Eve dance at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro with Darrell Kalmbach calling and Randy Lewis cueing.
January 4th is a regular dance with Bev Flint workshopping some new steps at 7:00-8:00 and then the January18th dance finds us "Chasing the Blues Away" with KC Curtis calling Pre-Plus at 7:30-8:00.
 The Toes are working hard on a quilt to raffle off during the 2019 year, in order to raise funds for finding a cure for cancer.  It will culminate at the Toe's "Man Enough To Wear Pink" dance.  Look for this beautiful quilt to visit your club and Good Luck to every one buying a ticket.
 Speaking of quilts... The River City dancers have a tradition of presenting "Quilts of Valor" to club members, and callers who served in the military.  This year they have chosen our very own Mr. KC Curtis!  The quilt will be presented to KC on Wednesday January 9th at the Montavilla Sewing center in Gresham at 3:00pm.  We couldn't be prouder of you, and we thank you for service to our country!  Congratulations KC!
Make your resolution now to visit the Toe's at least a few times this year, we'd love to see you.  Happy New Year!
