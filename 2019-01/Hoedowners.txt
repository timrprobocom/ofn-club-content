November 10th was our 11th Annual Turkey Toss Dance.  Thank you guests.  This dance is always very popular because it’s a bit of a <gobble>gamble, (Will my ticket be drawn?), a bit of a sporting event, <gobble>, (Can you get the bean bag in the corn hole?) a bit of a <gobble> competition, (Am I a better at tossing than the other competitor?), and a lot of laughs<gobble, gobble>.  We had eleven turkeys up for grabs and each one went home with their happy winner.  Was it my imagination or were we being haunted <gobble> by wild turkey calls all evening?  I’ll never tell <gobble><gobble>.  After the dance, I think it was our sense of smell not hearing that drew everyone to the dining room for turkey, dressing and fixings.  <gobble><gobble><gobble>
 November 24th was our Soup Dance and it was super.  Such a splendid variety and with a supply of small bowls you could try each and every one more than once.  Pans, crockpots, Dutch ovens and instant pots lined the table.  Daryl Clendenin won the Hoedowner spin it and he was plotting where to spend it when I saw him last.
 January 12th is our elegant Black and White Sparkle Ball; dimmed lighting, winking and chasing white lights scattered about and mirrors everywhere.  It will be a truly splendid evening with Daryl Clendenin calling and Randy Lewis cueing bringing their usual best. Come and twirl across the floor at the Aloha Grange Ballroom.  Wish we could do the planetarium scene from La La Land but we’ll do our best to give you a special evening.
 And on January 26th we’ll be dark for mid-Winter.  The Hoedowners are heading south for the celebration of “The American Dance 2019”.  Boy, we’re ready!  See you in Albany for the weekend.
