We start out the new year with the retirement of Ken Pratt as our part time cuer/instructor. He has been coming to our club on the second and fourth Thursdayâ€™s to teach and mentor Stephanie Lozano and Leonard Snodgrass as they get things arranged and ready to teach on their own. They feel they are ready to take on the entire time to teach and cue for the club. We have gained a lot of knowledge and had a lot of fun with Ken and Dianne as they made the trek from Hillsboro for us and for his Monday nights that will continue.

At the end of November, the Cha class made it through all the Phase 3 moves and moved on to Phase 4 moves in December. The West Coast Swing class continues on the road to an unending list of moves to conquer. We will persevere. It has been fun and a challenge at the same time. 

We will have a two hour event on the Thursday after Christmas, December 27, to dance off the Christmas meal. We have also decided to go dark on Thursday before Mid-Winter, January 24, to support the trails in dance and to dance to Scot and Erin Byars from California. Come and join us. We at ReVuNQ hope you have a good Christmas and a great Happy New Year. Marilyn Schmit
