Happy New Year everyone! We hope your holidays were peaceful and festive too. Our New Dancers' Dance is on January 12 and we look forward to it. And soon we’ll all be enjoying Mid-Winter Festival. 

Coming up in March is our annual Coast Trip, on March 8 and 9, when we'll be dancing both nights at Gleneden Beach Community Club. All are welcome! I know it’s a tossup what kind of weather we’ll have, but the Oregon coast is a lovely spot even on a blustery day. Karen
