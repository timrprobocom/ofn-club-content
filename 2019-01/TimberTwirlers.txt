Our dances have been small but lots of fun. Thank you to the regular dancers that join us to fill out our squares. You are really appreciated.
 
We just had our New Dancers dance on Dec. 2. We held it at the Salem Square Dance Center as the halls in our area are few and very expensive so glad we still have a few halls that are dedicated to square dance use.  We had a pretty good turnout of dancers, angels and callers/cuers. Thank you all. Sandy
