 In January we held a fun “Cowboy Country” B-51 dance which had 42 attendees.  Our Mainstream and Two Step Lessons continued, with 12 students signing up again for the second half of Mainstream, and 14 for Two Step.  Also we had 13 members (almost half our club) and 10 students enjoy the Mid Winter Festival in Albany this year.
 In March we plan to visit PAC’s Braids ‘n Braves in McMinnville - our cuer’s other club - for their anniversary.  Watch for our two Friday night dances, “The Wearin’ o’ the Green” on the 13th and “Rat Pak Reflections” (Remember Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr?) on the 27th, with our caller Terry Halley and cuer Sandra Pinion.  Looking forward to spring!
