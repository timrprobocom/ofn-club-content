Again, I can’t remind you all enough. Don’t forget July at Diamond Lake in 2020. We will have a real “TRIFECTA: and a bonus with 3 callers of National Status. We will have Mike Sikorsky, Michael Kellogg and Mike Haworth with the bonus of Rikki Lobato as the featured cuer.

Come out and join us on March 13th for the next Game Night. The theme for this one is “Italian.” Make your favorite pasta dish or salad and come out to join us. We have a blast. If you don’t play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on. We are open to most any table game.

Classes are going well and the students are really enthusiastic. The January beginner class is doing great. Everyone is having a great time with classes. The Thursday class is graduating on March 26th. Stay tuned for more details.

The February 8th dance was a LOT OF FUN. There were a couple of surprises in the line-up of amateur callers. Our own “Caller’s Lady” was one surprise and Stan Jones was another. Both show a lot of promise.

The Stars are once again collecting stuffed animals for the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department to give to children in distress. Last year we collected and donated 200+ animals. I think we can do better. There is a tote on the stage at the Rogue Valley Square Dance Center to put the animals in. PLEASE HELP!!!

We are again going to sponsor the Alzheimer’s Benefit Dance. It will be on Sunday, June 7, 2020 from 2 to 5pm. This is a very worthy cause and hits home to a lot of us in the square dance world. All proceeds will go to Alzheimer Research. The callers & cuers are donating their time and the Stars are donating the hall. A Challenge has been issued. Last year we raised $520+ and the challenge is to double that, at the very least.

See you in a square!
