Our first dance in February was February 8. Since we now have many single members in our club now, we decided to have our theme dance for February focus on Friendship rather than Valentines. We celebrated the joy of friendship at that dance and also celebrated the graduation of our class. Many of these new dancers have already joined our club and were warmly welcomed. Our second dance each month is a regular dance.

Our annual beach trip is at Lincoln City March 6 and 7. Fun activities are planned. Our first dance in March celebrates “the luck of the Irish” and our first dance in April on April 11 is our 70’s dance.

Come join us.
