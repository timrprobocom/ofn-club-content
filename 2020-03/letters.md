The National Square Dance Convention will be in Spokane, WA -  June 17-20.  If you have never attended a National Square Dance Convention, this will be the perfect opportunity for you to go.  The last time the Convention was on the west coast was in 2012.  You will have the opportunity to dance with callers, cuers, and dancers from around the world.  It is a high energy, fun packed weekend full of events for all ages.  If you have kids and are still trying to decide whether or not they will enjoy dancing, there are already 58 kids registered!   Visit the 69th National Square Dance webpage at: https://www.69nsdc.org for more information and for your registration form.
 
In addition to all of the dancing, there will be a Fashion Show on Saturday at 1:00 pm.  The Fashion Show has a Dr. Who theme, because square dance fashions are out of this world!  We are looking for youth and the young-at- heart (adults) models, escorts, hosts, hostesses, ushers, and other volunteers.  (please put the flyer link here) If you would like to be a part of a fun event, please contact me prior to June 1.
