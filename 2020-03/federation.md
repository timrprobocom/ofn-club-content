### Publicity and Education

During our Mid-Winter seminar on Social Media we briefly discussed some popular  social media sites followed by a  mini informational session on how to create and use your own Facebook page.  We also looked at how to create  Groups, Pages, and Events in Facebook.   I’ve attached the handout that I distributed during the seminar for your information: 
[Social Media and Facebook Basics](http://ofn.club/content/2020-03/2020-01%20Social%20Media%20and%20Facebook%20Basics.pdf).   In addition to learning about Social Media, we briefly discussed how to convert Word and Publisher files to a photo format so that the files can be posted on Facebook or in the OFN: [Converting Word to Picture Format](https://ofn.club/content/2020-03/Converting%20Word%20to%20Photos.pdf).  We also talked about the difference between Windows Print Screen and Apple’s Screen Shot. 
 
If you have any questions on the information, please contact me.
