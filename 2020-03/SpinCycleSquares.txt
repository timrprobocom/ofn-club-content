We dance almost every Sunday at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield from 5:30 to 8:00.  We dance all levels.  Our caller, Tim Matteson, will adjust the levels according to who shows up to dance.  It's always FUN, and we always have a lot of FOOD!  We encourage all square dancers to join us!  The floor is cushioned and comfortable! We even have heat and air conditioning!

Please call Tim at 541-988-0399 or David at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are dancing.  We are dark once in a blue moon, but we'd hate to miss you.

 FYI, we are dark March 1 because the Eugene Opera Company has a rehearsal in our hall.

Keep on dancing,
Christina Corelli
