 We started out the year with 16-18 beginners, at our Wednesday night lessons.  Including Plus we had 3 squares dancing.  What an encouraging way to begin the year.  Thank you Craig for always keeping it interesting even for those who may wish to join us as angels.  A good time for the middle of the week activity. 
 We only had the 2nd Friday dance.  Many went to Mid-Winter the last weekend of January.
 March is our anniversary month.  67 YEARS!!!  Please do come on Saturday March 28th to celebrate with us.  Earlier in the month, on Friday 13th, Guest caller, Jim Raupp will call a B-51 dance, an opportunity for our students to enjoy an evening of just dancing.  (I remember those dances, scared I would mess up everyone)It is especially nice to be able to go to a dance where the experienced dancers make you begin to feel apart of the square dancing community.
 Dance info:  7pm - 8pm Plus with advanced rounds, 8pm - 9:30pm Mainstream with rounds. 106 NW 8th Ave, Kelso, WA 98626 by the Rotary spray park at the intersection of Hwy 4 and W Main, Kelso/Longview.  Our dances are $6 admission. 
 See you all at our anniversary dance, March 28th!!
