The rambunctious Ramblers welcomed national caller Dan Preedy for our February dance, themed Okay Q-pid!. Hearts abounded in the dance hall, and their beats quickened as Mr. Preedy filled the hall with music and lighthearted energy. Highlights included his renditions of Roger Miller’s “King of the Road” and Simple Minds’ “Don’t You Forget About Me.” We were thrilled to receive visitors from Country Cut-ups, Happy Hoppers, Bachelors and Bachelorettes, and Chaps and Petticoats.
 
The Ramblers will be dark in March, so we can support the Puddletown Squares Rain Festival in Seattle. Speaking of dance weekends, now would be a great time to purchase tickets for the Ramblers’ annual dance weekend in the fall. Early bird pricing is available through the second weekend in March. The dance will take place at the Multnomah Arts Center October 23-25, 2020. Once again, we will have some of the world’s best callers: Anne Uebelacker (Seattle), Bill Eyler (Palm Springs), and Gary Monday (Seattle). Information is available through our website: rosetownramblers.com/scares-n-squares.
 
Our next monthly dance will be April 11. The gregarious Gary Monday will be migrating south from Seattle for this dance. We’ll have Advanced dancing from 4:30 to 6:30, a potluck from 6:30 to 7:30, and then we will alternate Mainstream and Plus from 7:30 to 9:30. We dance at the Oak Grove Community Center, 14496 SE Cedar Ave., Oak Grove, Oregon. We’d love to see YOU there!
 
SYIAS!
