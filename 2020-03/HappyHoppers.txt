     It’s good news!  Our caller, Jim Hattrick, is back calling and cueing for us.  As was mentioned in the February issue, Jim had some serious health issues in December and January.  Our club is very pleased to have him with us once again.   We are extremely grateful to the community of callers and cuers who graciously stepped in to help during his illness.  At Jim’s first dance back with us, January 18th, Daryl Clendenin teamed up with Jim for a truly fun night of dancing.  What a pair!  Craig Abercrombie continues to share time with Jim at our lessons.  It is a wonderful way for our students to have experience dancing to the different voices of callers.  

     During February we are continuing a tradition of collecting food for a local food bank, the North Clark County Food Bank.  This is just one of the three to four community oriented activities our club sponsors during the dance year.  

     We are looking forward to a visitation to R Square D in March.   It’s always fun to attend their club and dance to Craig Abercrombie’s enthusiastic calling and Lonnie Syck’s great cueing.  We will also start the fourth round of eight-week lesson sessions.  We have been blessed with a terrific group of students this year.   It is always exciting to see how many new students will arrive at the beginning of each session.  Since we have had so many interested students, we plan to extend our lesson sessions with one additional eight-week session being added for the months of May and June.  Hopefully this will allow students to complete mainstream levels and polish their skills so that they can attend dances during the summer and be ready for the fall schedules.
