Welcome to spring! Or at least it should be close.

As we are gearing up for traveling to some of the spring and summer festivals and conventions please make sure you are ready for travel.

If you don’t usually travel much or make big purchases on your credit card, make sure that you contact your bank ahead of time to let them know that you will be traveling and where so that they don’t block you trying to pay for your hotel room.

If you are traveling internationally, check your phone service and see what you need to do to still receive and make calls (provided you want to stay in touch locally while you are gone). Also you can order currency from your bank for the country you are going to ahead of time.

Something to know as you are going to larger dances is the Emergency Call for Medical Aid.

1. When a dancer goes down, one other dancer in the square will attend to the injured dancer.

2.The other dancers will back up in a circle, to give the injured and attending dancer room and air.

3. The remaining dancers will lift their hands into an arch, known as the **E**mergency **C**all For **M**edical **A**id (**ECMA**) formation.

4. Upon seeing this, the caller or hall monitor will place an Emergency Call For Medical Aid; summoning paramedics, etc. If this does not occur, a dancer should run to the stage to alert the caller, or those in charge, so the proper authorities can be summoned as quickly as possible. 

If you don’t feel well while in a square or just can’t finish the tip, signal to a dancer watching who isn’t dancing for them to come take your place. Or if you know that you are likely to have to have someone replace you – make sure that you make arrangements with another dancer before you head out onto the floor. Don’t just leave the square without a dancer if you can avoid it.

See you at a dance soon.
