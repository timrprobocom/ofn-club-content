 Our mainstream class graduation on January 6th was an adventure: there was dancing in the dark with flashlights, and in paper bag “overshoes” before the certificates were given.  Then we enjoyed the Trivia Dance, where lots of prizes were given for a correct answer to a trivia question.  Prizes included Smarties, and Uno Bars - appropriate prizes for smart answers.
 Our club was dark for the Presidents Potluck and meeting so our members who are new to the square dancing world could experience how the TVC meetings are run and also meet TVC Reps and dancers from other clubs.  We had the highest percentage of our members present.
 Seven of our members enjoyed dancing at Mid-Winter; for some it was their first Festival Dance.
 On February 3rd, we held our Ground Hog Day Dance, where ‘ground hog’ (sausages) were part of the refreshments.  Our caller went through the first tip twice, but when he said, “Good morning, Oak Hills Squares” the dancers caught on to the reference to the movie “Ground Hog Day,” and enjoyed a good laugh.
 Our lessons for new dancers have started, during the first hour of the dance – 6:30 to 7:30.  Angels welcome.
 Our March 2nd dance will be Mardi Gras theme – wear your beads and join us!
 Please join TVC’s newest club on Mondays from 6:30 to 8:30. The first Monday of the month is our theme dance and continues until 9:00, with mainstream dancing to all singing calls, phase two rounds and open break.
