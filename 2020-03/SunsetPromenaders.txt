 Sunday February 9th the Sunset Promenaders hosted a celebration of life for Ken Pratt with a turnout of over 300-attending. Ken and Dianne Pratt were very active in the Northwest Round Dance world. Ken passed away suddenly on January 1st.  Ken and Dianne taught round dancing for years and they were very popular because of his knowledge and skill at teaching rounds plus they made it fun with humor. We are missing him greatly, it has been great having them as our club cuer for several years. 
 This month our Thursday Plus Dance nights are on March 5th, and the 19th featuring Darrell Kalmbach calling, and Tami Helms cueing. The dancing starts with Intermediate Rounds from 7:00 and the Plus starting at 7:30 until 9:30 with a break after.
 The Saturday Mainstream dances are the 3rd of March with a theme of “The Roaring 20’s”. And on March 21st with a theme of “Irish Fling” with baked potatoes at the break.  
Mike and Julie Stout are our Mainstream caller and cuer.
 All our Mainstream Dances start with Intermediate Rounds at 7:00 until 7:30. Then our Square Dances start at 7:30 until 9:30 with a Plus every third tip.
 Thank you to all you visitors that come to our dances, hope to see you soon, we really appreciate it.
