Wow. The time is flying by. We have danced our Annual Wear Red Dance with five squares on the floor in a sea of red.  Such fun! 

Our next big dance is our Annual Hobo Dance on March 20. You do not want to miss this. Come dressed in your best Hobo attire and enjoy a heapin' helpin' of not one, not two but THREE kinds of Hobo stew.

Mark your calendars for our 54th Birthday Dance on Friday April 17. A flyer will be posted soon. See you all on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
