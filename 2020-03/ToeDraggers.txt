 We had a fun group of masked dancers at our Masquerade dance!  There was every imaginable kind, including several unique handmade ones.
 Toe’s had so much fun at Mid-Winter Festival, several met there for dinner at Elmers.
 March 6th will be a new theme for us, an “Alice in Wonderland” dance, and March 20th will be a regular dance.  We’d love to see you across a square, so come on over to the Kinton Grange and dance with the Toe’s.
