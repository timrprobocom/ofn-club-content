The club survived all the practices for the Showcase of Rounds at Mid-Winter and has started on beginning Fox Trot for the winter/spring season of lessons. We had one new dancer the first night and will welcome more, hopefully, the next week.
We are still reviewing previously learned rhythms in the Phase 3-4 realm of dancing and getting better each week. There is always something to pick up when dancing.
We will hold a meeting in March to vote for Federation officers, club officers and discuss future rhythms for lessons and see what else the dancers want to talk about. Come and see us and share the dance floor with the rest of us. Marilyn Schmit
