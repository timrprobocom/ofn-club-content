After being dark for one dance in January because of our support of Mid-Winter and dark another dance in February due to the cloggers taking over the Grange, I believe that March will come in like a lion for the Columbia River Dancers as we celebrate our 5th anniversary.  So, plan ahead to dance with us at the Hazel Dell Grange on March 14th.  Adam Christman, from Spokane, will be our caller and cuer again this year.  Anyone who has danced when Adam calls knows how special it is.  We will be giving out our number 5 dangle to the first fifty dancers to come through the door.  

Things continue to stay hot at our March 28th dance with Jim Hattrick back with us again.  Jim has recovered rather nicely from his recent hospital stay so come out and welcome him back to the CRDs.  

Our lessons are starting again the first Tuesday of the month so convince you friends and neighbors to try one time.  Remind them that it is nothing like they learned in elementary school.  Our first lesson is free so what do they have to lose. 

See you in a square soon
