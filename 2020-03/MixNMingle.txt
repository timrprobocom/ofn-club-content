 You can usually count on the M&M’s to be dancing at the Winona Grange the first and third Saturday of every month, but our 2020 calendar has been tweaked a bit to include several “dark” dates.  If you are not a regular at our dances (and don’t have these dates on your calendar),  please be sure that you have confirmation of the dance from a reliable source before heading to Tualatin.  Our first “dark” date will be March 7th.  We will NOT be dancing on that night, March 7th,  but Randy and Jeanine are scheduled and ready to do their calling and cueing thing on March 21st. The third Saturday in March is a go!  We will keep you updated on calendar changes thru this OFN report as well as our website:  mixandminglesquares.org
