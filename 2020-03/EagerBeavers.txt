 Vests advertising the August Oregon Summer Festival in Seaside were conspicuous in the Grand March opening of Winterfest in Albany.  Twenty seven of our members attended and some even did a singing and dancing routine, wowing the crowd of course, inviting them to the Summer Festival.  Support the host clubs by buying your ribbons now.  If you cannot go you can sell them to someone who didn’t plan ahead.
 One of our members said “This was the first year my feet didn’t hurt on the way home.” then he added sadly, “But I wish they did.” He is presently suffering with a bad hip. 
 Plus lessons at noon will be continuing after starting February 10th.  That is the plan anyway.  Even if you are a plus dancer you can always do a little brushing up and help out the new students. 
 Speaking of plans and how they change,  Important notice of location change:  Starting in March we will be dancing at the Aloha Grange at 3425 185th Ave., Beaverton, OR 97006, off TV highway.
 March is famous for a couple of things: St. Patrick’s Day and Break Week for students.  The Irish seem to have a good time celebrating and happy to see you celebrate too.  Any excuse is a good excuse for a party and dancing with friends.  However, I do not think I can handle break week with students anymore. 
Keep your mind fresh by visiting other clubs.  See if you can dance to a different caller and cuer.  They love visitors. 
 During lessons our regular Plus dance is at 1:15 - 3:00 pm immediately following the noon class.  Come enjoy our three great callers.  We dance "Every Monday Afternoon" at Sunset Presbyterian Church 14986 NW Cornell Rd. Beaverton, OR 97229.  Please check for up to date information at www.EagerBeavers.info.
