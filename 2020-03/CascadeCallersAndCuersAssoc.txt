Our next scheduled dance is February 29 (Leap Year!) at the dance center in Springfield.  The members of CCCA will call and cue a fun dance for you! The floor in our hall is cushioned and so nice to dance on.  The Eugene Opera is using our facility that day but will be finished in time for our CCCA meeting and dance.  Pre-Rounds are at 7:30 and square dance from 8:00 to 10:00.  Put this on your new calendars!

Keep on calling and cueing for fun,
Christina Corelli
