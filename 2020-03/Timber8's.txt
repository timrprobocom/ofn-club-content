We celebrated Cap's 93rd birthday in February. She is the oldest dancer in Roseburg and dances nearly every tip still! Several schedule changes are coming up for us in March & April. We will be dark March 14, but will have a dance March 28. In April, we will dance 1st & 3rd Saturday instead of our regular 2nd & 4th. April 4 will have guest caller Dan Nordbye. April 18 is our birthday dance with Richard Lane & Neil Koozer. Hope you can join us.
