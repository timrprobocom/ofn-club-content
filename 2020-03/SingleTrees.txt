In January we had only one dance because we went dark for Mid-Winter on the 4th Friday.  We did not get to dance to Jim Hattrick that 2nd Friday because he was still recuperating from his ordeal in the hospital with multiple surgeries.  Instead we had Roger Putzler call for our New Dancer Dance along with Christina Corelli who kindly substituted fro Jackie Gale who was under the weather with bronchitis.   Roger and Christina always make a good duo and Roger was just right for the new dancers because he is their lesson caller here in Springfield!  We had 8 new dancers out, and they all seemed to enjoy the evening very much.   We know we enjoyed having them.  We’re looking forward to our Luck of the Irish dance with Jim Hattrick calling and Jackie Gale cueing March 13th.   We will have a baked potato bar at 7PM followed by our regular dance format, 7:30 plus, 8-10PM mainstream with no formal break.

Please come join us on a 2nd or 4th Friday.  We’d love to meet you and dance with you. 

On Feb. 28 we will be dark because the hall has been rented to the Eugene Opera for about 10 days.  Those of you who were looking forwarding to dancing to Richard Lane again will have to wait until September or drive down to Roseburg where he calls a plus dance for Timber 8’s once a month.
