In that the Oregon Federation Newsletter (OFN) is typically published early, the Chaps and Petticoats (C&P) invite Angels and New-Dancers, alike, to join us for our New Dancer MS Graduation, on Sunday, FEB 23rd from 6-8pm at the Maplewood Grange in Aurora.  Help us cheer on our two (2) strong new-dancers AND watch as they “Roast” their Instructor, Scott Zinser, as an expression of appreciation! For C&P, thank goodness we did our fundraising (last year) and could continue to teach lessons regardless of how many students consistently showed.

It is an eye-open when we lose a loved one to see how much they have impacted our dancing world.  We were blessed to see and feel the warmth at the Mid-Winter “Diamonds of Dance.” Showcase of Rounds - a tribute to Ken Pratt, Cuer (who passed in the early hours on JAN 1st).  To hear his voice, as rounds Choreographer, filled our eyes with tears. Did you participate in the Celebration of Ken’s Life on FEB 9th? Wow, 280+ people filled the Hillsboro IOOF Hall (including Ken and Dianne’s family) and sooo many round dancers/cuers let Dianne know she was supported … we love you Dianne.  Thank you, Sunset Promenaders for hosting.

Chaps and Petticoats’ 1st and 3rd MARCH dances are no-theme dances, but will be filled with Caller surprises and Round-dance fun as we welcome:
     Scott Zinser & Stephanie Lozano on March 6th *
     Mike Kious & Christina Corelli on March 20th * first appearance with C&P for these Caller/Cuers ... 
     - please turn out to support them!

Will you join us for our APRIL theme dances?  Costume prizes will be awarded at our April 3rd Hippie-dance and a roasted-pig (turkey optional) dinner will be served on April 17th when we “Go Hog Wild”… see April Flyers.

Happy Feet,
Betty Chipps
