We continue to dance mostly to recorded tips on two Sundays a month when there are enough dancers available.  A poll is taken the week before a scheduled dance to assure we will have a square.  We dance at the Emerald Square Dance Center at 2095 Yolanda Ave. in Springfield off I-105

At times we have two squares of dancers on the floor in Hall B behind the center.  We’re a tight knit group with members who love dancing at the advanced level; some of us also dance at the C-1 level.  We have been offering a class to dancers who want to upgrade their skill level to C-1.  This group sometimes meets for one hour before the advanced dance which goes from 2-4PM and sometimes they meet at the library in Junction City.  If you’d like details and would like to brush up your challenge skills call Fred Beisse at 458-221-3564.  For a look at our future schedule, please go to our website at http://cas-sq.yolasite.com.   Be sure to call ahead to find out if we are still dancing on any particular date (unless you are on Fred’s email list and have gotten a “Go” from Fred.

Hope to see some of you join us some Sunday.  On Feb. 9 we had Dan Preedy from Spokane, WA on Feb. 9, and had a wonderful time.  He even called a C-1 star tip for us.
