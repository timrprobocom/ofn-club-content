Our classes are done and they provided us one couple to join our club.  It’s not surprising since (for many years) the largest part of our membership has come to us from other established clubs, or from dancers who have taken a hiatus from dancing, but still remember how to dance. 

We’re a well-managed club.  Our board watches the ups and downs of dance attendance very carefully, and surmises why attendance may be up or down on any particular night.
