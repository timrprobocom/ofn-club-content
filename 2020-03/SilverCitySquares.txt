We had a change of caller for our February dance. Since Leonard was gone, Thomas Buchheit stepped in and called for us. It was kind of fun to have a dance on Valentine's Day. Thank you to everyone who joined us for our club birthday.

Our competition teams have started practices and are trying their best. The kids have their fundraiser dance later this month on March 22. Please see our flyer and join us if you can. In addition to a basket raffle, calling and cueing by Leonard and Frances, the kids are offering a brunch breakfast prior to the dance. See you at a dance soon.  Petrina Buchheit
