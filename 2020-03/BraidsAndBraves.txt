We had two squares on the floor for our 50's dance. Bruce Lowther called a few tips along with Leonard, and Judy Russell cued rounds. We had guests from Sweet Home Squarenaders, Valley River Dancers, Toe Draggers and some independents. We celebrated graduation for our Square Dance class and all seven joined the club. Hooray! Looking forward to Spring! Carmen
