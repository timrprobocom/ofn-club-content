 Our 20th Anniversary Dance is Friday, February 28th. We hope you will come dance and wish us a happy birthday in person and enjoy some delicious cake and ice cream as we celebrate at break.  We know of at least a couple of clubs planning visitations so we are anticipating a fun night.
 February 29th we are dancing ‘A’ at the Woodburn Senior Estates and we would love to have you join us.
 March 13th George Hermann will be on-stage for our Plus night.
 March 27th will be our Hippie Dance, so bring your dance moves and groove with us to Randy Dibble’s calling and Sherri Clark’s cueing.
 The Valley River Dancers dance Plus on 2nd Fridays (Randy Dibble Calling, Guest Cuer), and Mainstream on 4th Fridays (Randy Dibble Calling, Sherri Clark Cueing) in Newberg at the Chehalem Community Center.  Randy Dibble also calls our ‘A’ dances on 5th Saturdays at the Woodburn Senior Estates Community Club.  https://www.valleyriverdancers.org
