This Mainstream FunShop is Thursdays at 6pm. We are also having a New Plus Class (FunShop) starting at 715pm on Thursdays. Come join us to refresh and build your Mainstream & Plus skills.  Our Tuesday Beginner class is doing great and having a lot of fun.
Our February dances were a great time - with the Tailgate Party and Precious Heart dances. Thanks to Chuck for calling and Rikki and Bob cueing at each dance.  We had quite a few in attendance for the Chili Cookoff potluck and there were lots of choices and some great chili and sides!! Thank you to the dancers who brought food!
March is the kickoff for March on Hunger and we encourage everyone to bring some canned food to donate when they attend our dances or classes in support of the local food bank. We have Phil Ramey & Sarge Glidewell for our "Can Can" dance on March 7th - with Pre Rounds starting at 7pm and Mainstream & Plus tips at 730pm.
