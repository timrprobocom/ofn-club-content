As we said goodbye to 2020, we entered 2021 full of hope and optimism. We are missing our square dance friends, the joys of dancing, and shared friendship. It now appears that a strong dose of patience needs to be added as we await the day the health guidelines allow us to resume dancing. 

The vaccine is coming and with it is a renewed hope. Meanwhile let is remember to reach out and stay connected to our fellow dancers., Stay well and hold on to the hope that we will be dancing again soon.
