 Hi everyone, aren’t we glad to see 2020 in our rearview mirror??!!  Hopefully  this finds you and yours doing as well as you can.  We’ve been lucky enough to be able to spend most days being entertained by our 10 year old Granddaughter.  She is such a delight, and we’ve made some lasting memories.  Like all of you, the Toe’s are really looking forward to lots of yellow rocks and dancing!  Count your blessings!
