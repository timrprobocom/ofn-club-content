The Ramblers join the general rejoicing in the availability of the COVID-19 vaccines. We seek wisdom in our leaders in the distribution of the vaccines and patience in our fellow citizens as we wait our turn to be vaccinated. 

As we look ahead to a return to dancing, the Ramblers are giving serious consideration to the Social Square Dance (SSD) program under development at CALLERLAB. Compared to the way most clubs currently operate, SSD offers new dancers a shorter, simpler, and more active route to becoming a dancer. Coming back from our COVID hiatus seems like a good time to give this a try. If any clubs or callers out there have experience with SSD, we would love to hear from you!

Wishing everyone good health and good cheer!
