Hello out there in Square Dance Land.  I wish I could report dates and times of dances and clothing sales.  But that is not to be.  Yet.  And in reference to Jim's comment about an easy job, I suggest we give our officers another year of stardom!  Give them a chance to really shine for two years in a row!
  
The Hoppers are going to have a meeting in February.  The first in several months.  Via Zoom, of course.  Looking forward to seeing their faces and hearing John Kaleta's jokes.   In the meantime, we have been getting together via Zoom to do square dances for one couple and line dances with Liza and Tom Halpenny.  So much fun to see everyone.  And Tom and Liza have committed to continue as long as necessary.   Thanks!  You two are the Bomb!! 
  
Looking forward to everyone being vaccinated and that herd immunity.  Until then, please stay safe and healthy.
