 How are your New Year Resolutions?  Did they die on the vine or budding into a new and more healthful habit?  Did you straighten your spine with determination and resolve to carry on in spite of all the downsides of 2020?  When you persist you will inspire others to put on a grin and shoulder to the wheel to make 2021 a brighter year.  See, that wry smile is making you feel better already.
 Now you know how it feels to miss all those great dances we took for granted last year.  We missed festivals, holidays, and the friends we see regularly.  When we begin dancing again resolve not to take all these great activities for granted and help with the organizing the celebrations.  My grandmother kept reminding me that “Many hands make light work.” when I tried to disappear to read my latest book.  It will take all hands on deck to “get back into the swing of things” so when the call comes say “count on me to help”.  Remember your callers are now suffering from cabin fever so they will be just as happy to see us as we are to hear them again.  
 I always liked the Valentine Dance and the crowning of the King and Queen of Hearts so maybe someone will find a way to elect them virtually this year.  I always like to look forward to themed dances during the year.  
 As I write this it is the last day of 2020 and my resolution for 2021 is to do my part in making someone else’s day a little more pleasant.  Maybe they cannot see my smile but they can see a friendly wave and hear a cheery greeting.  
 For now I put on the music and dance around the living room.  I will be seeing you in the square some time this year.  
 Do not just hope for a better year, be part of the process.  Keep the faith and keep checking for our start date at www.EagerBeavers.info.
