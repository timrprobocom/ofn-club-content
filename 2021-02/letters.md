Well, we made it through 2020 and are waiting to see what 2021 will bring us.

From what I have heard, most in person square dancing in Oregon will not start until late spring, or maybe even fall.

I'm happy to say I have been dancing and calling on Oregon during the lockdown.  I began doing it around April 2020 online.  I don't have a partner or any other dancers quarantining with me, but my phantoms and I are still enjoying dancing and having a lot of fun.

One or two couple virtual square dancing on Zoom started shortly after the lockdowns began all over the world.  The first ones I saw were from Bob and Dorothy Simpson and Darby Love calling from the garage in Quesnel, BC.  They did one couple squares and round dancing.  That really piqued my interest.  Shortly thereafter, Mike Dusoe and Denise Carbonell started up with virtual square dances, and meany more followed.  At least, that was the way I found them.

There is a Facebook page called "virtual square dance" (you have to join the page) which lists weekly dance schedules, and lots of YouTube videos that teach how to dance with phantoms and have entire dances you can watch and dance to.  Check out virtual square dancing and one couple dancing online.

I have met so many people from all over the world (I can now advertise that I am an international caller).  I have had dances with dancers from Australia, Sweden, Germany, and many other coutries, as well as dancers from all over the USA.  It has been so much fun getting to know these fun people.  I usually set aside time during my hour or hour and a half for people to 
visit between tips.

If you have not tried this, I sincerely suggest you do so.  It takes a little practice, but since there is not a full square, if you mess up, who cares?  You're having fun.

You can also find round dancing all phases, and square dancing up through challenge.  You can dance to callers you may not ever have had a chance to dance to before.  So, come on, give it a try, folks.  You will be so happy you did.  You can always contact me on my Facebook page with any questions you might have.

Keep smiling, keep dancing

In response to the absence of normal square dance activities, Tom and Liza Halpenny are leading online Zoom dancing most Mondays at 7:00 p.m. for about an hour. We dance “square dancing for one couple,” plus western line dances and international folk dances which are taught. The square dancing uses recordings by Jim Hattrick and Buddy Weaver designed for one-couple squares. Participants can join the dancing or just watch and enjoy the music. Between dances, chatting and joke telling are encouraged. Let’s Keep Hoppin’ began in July as a temporary activity, using the Happy Hoppers club Monday lessons time slot, in order to maintain social connections with square dancers. We led 20 meetings in 2020 and we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. Contact Tom at gnitened@yahoo.com to be added to the notification email list with the Zoom link.
