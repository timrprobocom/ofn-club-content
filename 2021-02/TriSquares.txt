 We've been having regular monthly board meetings over Zoom, even more inspired now by the coming vaccinations.  Now we're beginning to discuss real plans for jumpstarting our club as soon as it's "legal" and safe.  And for all our members we continue a monthly Zoom chat, which president Dale has dubbed "gabfests", which are great for staying in touch and for morale.  As always, keep exercising and stay safe!
