Happy 2021 and welcome February.  

Sadly, we have no dancing news to report for Chaps and Petticoats.  Maplewood Grange remains closed, except for some interior renovations and exterior maintenance.  

Emails, texts and phone calls have been our means of staying in touch with each other.  We did gather, before Christmas, at a member’s home with one-third (1/3) of our membership in attendance.  It was great to visit and share a meal - felt like normal and time flew by.

Now that the COVID vaccine is rolling out to our necessary workers, care facilities and some appointments are occurring, we sure hope the wearing of masks, social distancing and  “shelter-in-place” is lifted soon and dancing can resume.  ‘Lessons for all’ will be the theme when our hall re-opens.
