 T’was the end of the year and a time to review
 Did any Hoedowners do anything new?
 Besides wearing face masks and washing our hands,
 The year twenty-twenty meant canceling plans.  
 We did get Mid-winter and an Anniversary dance
 But everything else was gone in a flash.
 We didn’t do Seaside in March like we thought
 Or camping in June to use the reservations we bought.
 Summer Festival plans and our pretty green vests
 Just became a part of the distancing mess.
 No pirates, no cowboy, no singing along.
 No classes, no Barn Dance, no themes used at all.
 No Seaside Sashay, no turkeys to toss
 No Applebees trips, we’ve been at a loss.
 No eating and laughing or goofy games played
 We did as we’re told and at home we all stayed
 Well, it’s the twenty first year and we’re looking ahead
 To getting a shot and stopping the spread.
 As soon as we know it’s safe to make pairs,
 We’ll grab a partner and form up a square.
 Stay safe!
