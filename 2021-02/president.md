As the vaccine becomes more available, the prospect of dancing again appears to be getting closer.  Once we have all received the vaccine, and the governor rescinds restrictions and opens up our venues, the “new normal” will still have to be worked through.  There will be some changes.  Perhaps dancing outdoors will come first.  Take time to do some proactive brainstorming about what this might look like, and plan a community event that would be a kickoff for a new beginning.  

As I write this in January, I am looking forward to the Federation Zoom meeting on Sunday, January 24.  It will be great to see the familiar faces of all the Federation officers and delegates.  We need this connection to make and share plans.  Even though there are no dance activities going on, it’s important to stay positive that our plans will make a difference in the future.  When you read this, the meeting will have already happened.  Get in touch with your Council delegates and have them share what the Federation is doing.

Some callers are doing “Zoom square dancing” for one or for a couple.  I have asked a couple of the callers to write an article for the OFN about how this works.   You might want to attend a “dance” to have fun and get some exercise for an evening.  Try it; you will like it!

I have attended some of the Zoom meetings that the Federation callers are holding in order to prepare for getting back to dancing.  They are discussing all aspects of “Callerlab’s” social square dancing.  Also, more information will be coming out on advertising using social media to reach the younger generation.  As always, we need more dancers, especially after the attrition that the pandemic is sure to have caused.  Being unified in this effort will help get our lesson graduates dancing sooner, and with other clubs. Consequently, we will all have more fun.  A lot of effort has been put into these plans.  My wish is that your club and caller will support this effort and make it happen.  New members are the name of the game.   

Swing Your Partner……..Especially on Valentine’s Day!
