 Like most other Councils, the TVC is mired down due to Covid-19 restrictions.  Eight of the thirteen TVC clubs are located within Washington County which is currently ranked at the highest risk category, "Extreme".  Until we drop to the "High" category there are no indoor activities.  So no social activities with personal contact.  
 This has not stopped all social activity, however.  The Sunset Promenaders have a weekly "keep in touch" email newsletter, open to all dancers.  Eager Beavers have their monthly Beaver Log with a new "sharing of  activities" of what members are up to. The TriSquares have monthly Zoom meetings currently discussing how to get started once it is safe to do so.  Hoedowners and the Aloha Grange completed their annual "Adopt a Family", donating Christmas gifts to a needy family.  Said coordinator Krystal Laas, "Missing was the usual camaraderie while folks are donating and then the wrapping party which was always especially fun.  I did enjoy seeing the faces of those who dropped gifts off at my house.  Social distancing was observed for the donating, wrapping, and delivering of the gifts."
