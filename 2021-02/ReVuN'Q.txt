	Good thing I got a reminder about not getting my report in on time. My fault for not getting it in as the new year was a blur of boredom.
	Our club so wants to get back to dancing and is looking for good news from Governor Brown in getting locations opened back up again.
	I continue to write a weekly (or so) email to the dancers letting everyone know how others are doing. I find this out from reading Facebook posts to keep up on people.
	Some people are doing outside stuff, others are trying to do some small family gatherings for the holidays that just passed. Others are just getting by waiting for some kind of activity to happen to get out of their homes. We will survive, hopefully sooner rather than later.
	See you on the dance floor trying to remember how to do the various steps to rhythms.
