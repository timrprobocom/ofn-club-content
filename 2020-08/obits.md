The Sunset Promenaders are sad to report the loss of their founding cuer, Ruth Canby.
After a four month battle with congestive heart failure, Ruth suffered a fatal attack on July 3, 2020.  Ruth Cued the Sunset Promenader dances for twenty five years and taught numerous couples to round dance.   Ruth was also a popular guest cuer with many clubs in the Willamette Valley and on the Oregon Coast.  She was an active member of the Capitol Callers and Cuers association and served as the TVC Cuer Advisor.  As a member of the Sunset Promenaders, Ruth not only cued dances, she contributed with decorations, potluck food and kept a series of scrapbooks for the club taking many of the photographs herself.  That was in the day when we had to take our film to be developed and Ruth always got two copies, one for the scrapbook and one to be given to the couples pictured.  She was a treasured part of the club and continued to attend club events whenever possible so even new members knew Ruth from club picnics and other events.

While Ruth was very busy with Square and Round dancing, she was also active in her church,  on several bowling leagues, winning many senior high game and high series trophies, and in her Rebekah and Odd Fellows lodges holding many local and statewide offices.  When she wasn’t occupied elsewhere Ruth kept busy with solving crossword puzzles in ink, she read voraciously and had an amazing container garden.  She would have been so upset to have missed out since her first tomatoes ripened less than two weeks after her death.

She attended many festivals and served on a committee for the 1994 National Square Dance Convention hosted in Portland, OR.
