We are now in Week 17 of the Ramblers Respite. In an effort to relieve our ennui, we had a Rambler Rendezvous in Portland's Sellwood neighborhood on Sunday, July 5. We took a two-mile Ramble through the neighborhood. Because we were outside and we all wore masks, we felt this was a relatively safe activity and a nice way to check in with other club members. We saw some beautiful and bucolic scenery along the pristine Crystal Springs Creek in the middle of the city. What a nice break from our routines!

We will plan another Ramble in August to try to maintain ties among our club members.

The square dance news is less positive. We continue to be on indefinite suspension. We have formally canceled our September monthly dance on September 12. We have also canceled our Scares and Squares dance weekend scheduled for October 23-25. 

Wishing patience and good health to all. 

Jeff Knapp, President
