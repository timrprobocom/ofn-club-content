Writing this just to let you know we are still here and still in a holding pattern (so to speak.) Due to COVID 19, we are still not dancing. We are all hoping and praying that it will not be much longer before we will be able to dance together again. In the meantime, we are putting safety first and not dancing until safe to do so.

We miss all our square dance family and hope you are staying safe and well. When we can safely dance again, we will let you know.
