 A message from the TVC President, Mike St. Clair:  "I have heard from some of the Delegates and they all agree we should cancel the Meeting and Dance in September that the TVC was scheduled to host for the Federation meeting, so  I am making the call and it will be canceled.  We donâ€™t want to put our people in jeopardy.  I am sending this to our State Delegate Josie Rosenbury, also Kathy Roberts, so they can take this to the meeting in July." 
 One of our TVC clubs, Hoedowners, have been having dances on Saturday evenings for Round dancing only.  They are limiting the number of couples to meet current guidelines along with requiring the wearing of masks.  Those who participate must have their temperature taken upon entrance.  Be sure to contact someone in the club before venturing out as space is limited to 12 couples.
 Please, wear a mask in public places and stay safe until we can meet on the dance floor again.
