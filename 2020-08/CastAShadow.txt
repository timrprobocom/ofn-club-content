We haven’t danced since February and do not expect to be dancing until there is a vaccine available to prevent getting this terrible infection.  We see that some clubs around the state and nation have tried using “noodles” cut into quarters so that there is no hand contact but that doesn’t meet social distancing requirements and most people agree they cannot dance and wear a mask.  With all the restrictions we are not going to take any chances.

Stay well; stay safe.

We’ll see friends in a square when it’s safe to do so.
