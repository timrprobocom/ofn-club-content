 August makes me think of picnics!  Back in the old days, when Bill Helms was our caller, the 3 clubs for which he called (Fun Lovers, Rose City Squares, M&M’s) would get together for a potluck picnic up in the grassy area next to Capitol Community Center.  It was always a good time with lots of food, BBQ burgers and camaraderie.  When circumstances changed, the M&M’s continued to have their own Club picnic but moved it to Tualatin Park which was just around the corner from where we danced.  We were always especially pleased to see Dan arrive with his ice cream maker - - treating us with something  yummy and refreshing and topping off a fun day.  Eventually, the yellow jackets brought a demise to our outdoor picnics, and although we tried holding the potluck in the basement of the Grange it just wasn’t the same.   We quit having picnics and instead added the “Red White and Blue” dance to our calendar - we didn’t want anyone missing out on the tradition of Dan’s homemade ice cream!   
  Here’s hoping that you get a chance to picnic outside with friends or family this August but if you don’t maybe, like us, you can at least just enjoy a little ice cream!
 We will keep you updated on calendar changes thru this OFN report as well as our website:  www.mixandminglesquares.org
