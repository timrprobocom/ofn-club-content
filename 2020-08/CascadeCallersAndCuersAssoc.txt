Our next scheduled dance is supposed to be October 31, but with the coronavirus/COVID-19 still active and growing, we will have to wait and see.

We trust everyone is doing what they can to be safe and that everyone is well and healthy.

Our hall in Springfield was closed around March 9 and will remain closed until further notice.

There is nothing at our hall for the month of July that I am aware of.  After that, we will see.  It's a little difficult to social distance with square dancing. 

You can never be too safe with this virus business.

Wishing you all good health,
Christina Corelli, Secretary
