Like others we haven’t danced since February since our last dance in February was canceled when the hall was rented to the Eugene Opera for rehearsals and then we canceled our 2nd Friday dance in March learning of how contagious this virus was and that there were cases close by in Lebanon.  We are canceling our dances for July and August and will hope something will break by September.

We normally have our club’s annual picnic at Suzanne Peterson’s country home near Eugene in July when the blueberries are ripe for picking, but our club members decided to be prudent and put it off until perhaps September.  We will take another poll to see how many want to pack their own picnic and sit out under the beautiful shade trees and talk.  The property is always lovely but many of the summer flowers will be gone of course.  Still it would be fun to see those who want to come socialize for a while.
