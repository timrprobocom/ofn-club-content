     Hello Dancers, from the Happy Hoppers. The questions we are facing these days are how to stay motivated, how to stay connected, and how to keep our clubs alive. It looks like it will be quite a while before we can gather to do social dancing. It was recently suggested by one of our board members that round dancing might be the first to come back since we can do it with a partner we live with, we don’t have to change partners, and we can keep a good social distance. And probably wearing a mask! But we are keeping an eye on the governor’s decisions and our own concerns about when it will be safe to resume lessons and dances.

     At our recent Zoom board meeting it was decided (reluctantly) that we will not have our yearly picnic in August. We will revisit the question again at each board meeting to determine if we will be able to have one at a later time this year.

     So, it seems like staying connected to our members becomes the most difficult and most important task. To this end we are trying to generate some group emails that let people share what they’ve been up to while staying close to home. So far, not a great response but we’ll keep trying. Also, one of our esteemed members has started calling people she knows that are living alone to see how they are doing. What a great contribution. Thank you, Jackie Amundson! Another great idea was presented to listen to Buddy Weaver’s videos: Square Dancing for One Couple. Not perfect but keeps the calls in our minds and we can do it in our homes.  So stay tuned. Next month we will
hopefully have a more optimistic report.
