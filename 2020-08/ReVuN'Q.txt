The club celebrated their 44th birthday on June 25 with 27 dancers and a cuer in attendance. Randy Lewis was the guest cuer and cued rounds from Phase 2-4 and did some higher level dances at the end for those who were still in attendance.

The club is in the planning stages for a Saturday round dance event for an afternoon or evening time frame. It will be for those who are unable to attend during the week. 	
There is also some planning in the works to sponsor a two- step class so after they graduate they can maybe feel comfortable to move up to an intermediate level class the following year. That will give them time to get in some floor time and have the steps mastered before attempting the Phase 3 level. Stay tuned for more details on Facebook. Marilyn Schmit
