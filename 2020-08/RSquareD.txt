 We did have a club meeting in June.  At the Kelso Senior Center we had space to social distance and most were wearing face coverings.  The turnout was better than usual.  We have missed our dancing friends so much we are even willing to attend a club meeting to say "hi".
 The difficult decision to cancel Octoberfest for 2020, was made.   As with all clubs at this time, making provisions for future gatherings seems fruitless.  We cancelled our coffee stop, one of our primary fund raisers.  A demo for the fair was cancelled...on and on it goes.
Our next meeting will be at Pat Faires' lake house.  Plenty of room for social distancing.  A Labor Day campout is scheduled at Vista Park in Skamokawa, another outdoor venue and opportunity to gather safely.
 That will wrap up our summer, until we meet again.  We hope our feet remember the moves because our minds seem a bit fuzzy. (Should say only speaking for myself)
 Reminder that any dances after September 1st will be regular schedule, 2nd Friday and 4th Saturday at 106 NW 8th Ave, Kelso, WA 98626.   Kelso Senior Center by the Rotary spray park at the intersection of Hwy 4 and W Main, Kelso/Longview.
 Regards to all,  and may you be healthy until we meet again in a square.  For current information see: www.r-square-d.info.
