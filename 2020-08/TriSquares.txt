 We are continuing with our monthly board meetings over Zoom and it’s nice to see one another, although the meetings grow shorter with not much on the agenda.  Right now the pandemic seems to be increasing around the country, but we’re still hoping to get together on August 16th for our annual picnic at a lovely park in Sherwood.  However, It may have to be a situation of bring-your-own-food, wear a mask, and space yourself six feet away from anyone else — instead of a potluck.  The park has lots of tables under the shelter.  We’ll see. 
 The board did decide that there will be no dancing lessons in the fall.  We’re looking at January as a possibility now.  Everyone please follow the CDC guidelines, stay safe, be patient, count your blessings, and tell me to do the same.
