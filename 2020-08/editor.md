Thanks for keeping the spirit alive.  Some of the callers are having discussion on Facebook on how we bring our activity back once the restrictions are lifted.  Many of us will be rusty, and square dancing will certainly not be "top of mind" for the rest of the public.

The table below shows a number of clubs starting lessons in August and September.  At this point, it is unlikely that any clubs will actually be starting lessons at that time.  I'm leaving the listings here, but you'll need to contact folks to find out for sure.

By the way, I have changed the way lessons are stored.  In the past, if you showed lessons starting in September, the system would have your lessons start EVERY September.  Now, it will ask you to enter the exact date your lessons begin.  That way, I don't display old lesson information any more.
