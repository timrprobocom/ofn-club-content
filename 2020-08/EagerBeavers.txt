  “When will this ever end?  When can we dance again?” is a heard again and again from my dancing friends.  Maybe this refrain should be the repeated chorus of a song.  I think most of our members are trying to keep themselves healthy to be ready when we get the call to “come to the dance tonight”.  That will be a happy day.  Keep your fingers crossed and keep those future dates for dances circled on your calendar.  Even pandemics come to an end one way or another.   
 Thanks to all those people who have been sharing on OFN and Face Book how to dance just as a couple or as one.  Some people are doing round dances with a limit on total number of people.  Keep all these ideas coming!
 Keep checking for our start date at www.EagerBeavers.info.
 The following message is for your information when life as we used to know begins again: We dance on most holidays.  Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 p.m. - 3:00, at the Aloha Grange, 3425 SW 185th, Beaverton, 97006
