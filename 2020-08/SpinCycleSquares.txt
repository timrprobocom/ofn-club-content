We have not had a dance since the end of February, and are dark the full month of July.

We learned that Patrick and his dog, Molly, made it to Wisconsin where Patrick has family.  Unfortunately, Molly, Patrick's dog, passed away.  She had fluid in her lungs and was in pain.  We are so sorry that Patrick lost both his big dogs.  One died here in Oregon before the move and Molly after that.

We are continuing to rent the parking lot at the dance hall for a short visit on Sundays.  We back our vehicles in a huge circle and either sit on our tailgates or bring a lawn chair.  We can visit and see each other and maintain a safe distance.  It works.

Stay safe and healthy,
