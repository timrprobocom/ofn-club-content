We were finally able to have a board meeting and now the new club officers can officially start their duties. Our new president is Teresa O’Neill, new secretary is Cheri Batterson and new Sunshine Ronda Whaley. All other officers remained the same. Of course, we are not doing any dancing. We would have been dark in August for the Polk County Fair, but that isn’t happening either!

IWW for years has supported Windsor Place (a group of homes in Salem for brain injured adults) with two coffee drives; one in July and one in December. We couldn’t collect coffee this July but still found a way to support them with monetary contributions from our club members.

I would say “see you at a dance”, but since no one has figured out how to dance and social distance, I will just say stay safe! LaVerne Bennett
