Well as I write this edition I trust you are pretty well all danced out, having just got back from Salem and a great Summer Festival!  A great big thank you to all those who worked in front and behind the scenes to make this dance a success!
 Our June 21st dance was a very special dance to raise funds for one of our dancers who was traveling to Uganda on a medical mission.  It was very well attended and the Timber Twirler’s club and their caller and cuer were there to help KC and Bev.  It was so much fun and we raised several hundred $$ for our special dancer friend JoAnne Bostwick.
 August 2nd dance theme will be “Beach Blanket Bingo” with all singing calls.  We will be handing out bingo numbers during the dance, and then at the break we’ll call the numbers, and you could be the lucky winner.
 Hope to see many of your smiling faces in a square soon.
