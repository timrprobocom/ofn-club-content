Willamette Squares’ most recent dance was baseball themed. Fans of a variety of baseball teams came sporting t-shirts, baseball caps, and other attire that represented their favorite teams. Sandy’s singing calls and Jackie’s round dance cueing gave everyone a chance to feel as if they’d made home runs, and our team captain, John, announced who won the split the pot and the door prizes. What would baseball games be without hotdogs, chips, and popcorn? Willamette Squares provided all the traditional foods associated with baseball. Everyone had a good time dancing, eating, and visiting! Jodee Howard
