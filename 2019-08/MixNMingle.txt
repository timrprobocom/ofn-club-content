Parties are always more fun when fun people come to celebrate.  At our annual Red, White, and Blue Dance the Country Cut-ups made a visitation and went home with a banner, for us to retrieve when we visit them.  We wound up the dance half an hour early to have time to enjoy Dan's home-cranked ice cream topped by fresh strawberries and blueberries, helped by Debbie.  
 This will be out in time to remind you that our traditional Root Beer Float Dance will be August 3rd.
