We are ready to welcome summer with casual attire, air conditioning, and  dances in our hall every second and third Saturday all summer.
 
We have noticed that membership in all the clubs is declining. This should be a concern of all of us. Our answer to this is to visit and support other clubs and square dance events in our area.  In July we were happy to welcome a visitation to our club from the B n Bâ€™s at our first dance. Our club went dark for our second dance in July (on July 20 ) to attend and support Summer Festival in Salem.  In August we are planning to visit Country Cut Ups to dance on their outdoor dance floor. We will be heading for Maplewood Grange on September 7 for the State organizational meeting dinner and dance.  October will find us in Seaside attending the Seaside Sashay.

We love having guests. Come visit us and we will visit you.

See you in a square
