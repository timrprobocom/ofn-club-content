This summer is a time of enjoying old traditions and experimenting with new ideas for the Happy Hoppers.  The new idea is trying out our air conditioned hall in the summer.  Although the Hoppers are normally dark in the summer, this year we are having two summer dances: one in July and one in August.  In order to keep our students dancing through the summer, both dances will be primarily at the mainstream level.  By the time this is published, the July dance which was a pizza feast dance featuring free pizza before the dance and a fun half hour of plus followed by mainstream will have already taken place.  The August 17th dance will be a time for more dancing and fellowship with friends, students and club members.  By the end of the summer we should know how successful we have been with summer dances in an air conditioned building and with encouraging our students to continue dancing.

	The old tradition, one of the highlights of the Hopper year, is a club picnic at the farm of Don and Joanne Oja on August 4th.   As square dancers, we love to eat, and the picnic is the perfect place to sample all the great food provided by our members as well as the terrific hamburgers and hot dogs grilled to perfection by our two great cooks:  Randy Amundson and Don Oja.

	September will find us back in our regular schedule with plus level dancing starting the first Saturday, September 7th.  We are excited to see if our second year of lessons in the new hall progress as well as our first year of lessons did. Classes will start September 9th with plus from 6:30 to 7:30, basic from 7:30 to 9:00, and mainstream from 9:00 to 9:30.  We are looking forward to continuing with previous students who have not completed their level and to meeting new students ready to experience our great activity.  In the meantime, we hope to square up with you at one of our summer dances or somewhere else in our square dance community.
