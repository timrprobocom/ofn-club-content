Our club held two advanced dances at the Emerald Square Dance Center’s Hall B in Springfield in the month of June.  The first held on Father’s Day featured Dan Nordbye in person.  We are so fortunate to have Dan here from Mesa Arizona for half the year.  He is calling for us once a month through September.   We normally have two squares of dancers on the floor with some left over.  We always have a great time and thoroughly enjoy Dan’s fine calling. 

We look forward to having Dan call for us in August on the 18th.  On the 11th we are hoping to have enough dancers to dance to recorded tips.  We would love to have more will join us for the recorded tips because that money helps offset what we must pay to have live callers.  Our coordinator Fred Beisse always finds top-notch callers for us to dance to whether they are live or recorded.  Please come join us and remember we dance in Hall B which is situation at the rear of the building on Yolanda and 20th.

Please visit our website at cas-sd.yolasite.com for more information about our tentative schedule for the coming months.  I see we have Dan Preedy scheduled to call for us on Feb. 9, 2020.  That is something to look forward to after Mid-Winter.  Mark your calendars.
