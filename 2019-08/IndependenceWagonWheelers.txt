As always, the IWW hall at the Rickreall Polk County Fairgrounds was dark in August, to make way for the County Fair. We continued to work at the Fair as our annual fund raiser, but our assignment has changed from the parking lots to the admission gates. We enjoyed August dancing at neighboring clubs and thank them for their hospitality and warm welcome.  

Our next IWW dance at the Fairgrounds will be September 7. Come dance with us then and on the first and second Saturdays of each month. 

Encourage friends, family, and work associates to join us for mainstream lessons at Salem Hospital on Sunday eveningâ€™s beginning in September. While singles are welcome, students are strongly encouraged to come as couples.  Keep dancing! Dee and Bert Mackaman
