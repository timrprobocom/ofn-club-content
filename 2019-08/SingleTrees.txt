In June we had our usual 2nd and 4th Friday dances, both of which were excellent.  Our first dance was a benefit dance for Greenhill Humane Society.  We hold this dance called “Reigning Cats and Dogs Dance” annually to help our furry friends in our area find their forever homes.  We raised over $250 in cash and also had donations of pet supplies and other needed items.  Jim Hattrick called and cued this dance for us; we always appreciate his cueing when Jackie Gale is unable to join us.  On June 28 we had Dan Nordbye calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  We tried out the speakers Dan Nordbye had loaned to us and found out later that the hall board had agreed to buy these speakers for he hall.  The sound was excellent.  We also saw that new LED lights had been placed around the halls and the kitchen which should see some savings on the electric bill and also should last longer and help our maintenance guys out a lot.  Dan calls a fine dance, and we are looking forward to having him call one more time in September before he heads back to Mesa.

On August 9th we will hold our Hawaiian Luau dance with Jim Hattrick and Jackie Gale.  It is always fun to see people wearing their Hawaiian shirts and muu-muus and leis of course.  Terry Halley will call our final dance of this season on Friday, Aug. 23rd.

We understand that our sister club the Boots N Sandals will hold their last dance on the 4th Saturday at the Emerald square Dance Center.  We are very sorry to see them have to fold.  They are one of the longest lasting clubs in this area.  Sure would be nice to see a big crowd gathered for their last dance.

See you in a square!
