We graduated 18 from our January class - with most of the new dancers under the age of 25.  We've had a good group of dancers for Square Dance 101 - which will hopefully encourage those participants to start regular classes in September.  
We are dark in the month of August due to the Josephine County Fair, but will resume in September with classes starting on Thu 9/5 and 1 dance on 9/7 with Phil Ramey & Sarge Glidewell. 
We will be dark for the 3rd Saturday dance to help celebrate Circle N Square birthday in Yreka with Caller Eric Henerlau & Cuer Rikki Lobato! 

Boatnik was a huge success and Joe Saltel & TJ Chadd were fabulous!!!  Next year's Boatnik will feature Bronc Wise & Peter Gomez - Memorial Weekend 2020. 
Fun starts on Friday and goes thru Sunday afternoon!! Plus we always plan a jet boat trip with the caller/cuer and dancers on Memorial Day.

Our 52nd birthday dance is set for December 7th with Michael Haworth & Rikki Lobato. 
If you haven't danced to Mike Haworth - you don't want to miss the chance - he is a great caller from Southern California!  

Although we are dark for August  - there are lots of festivals happening that we plan to attend.  

Happy Dancing
