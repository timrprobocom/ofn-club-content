We had great fun at the Mt. Angel 4th of July parade. This was our first time doing this parade and we were very well received by the crowd watching. Bruce Lowther was our caller for the morning. This was also our first time out with our trailer. Our next parade will be Homer Davenport Days parade the first Saturday in August.

Our youth are looking forward to summer festival with their concession stand. They have a great menu and low prices. This is a fundraiser for them to help with going to next year's Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival. We definitely have to work at fundraising for the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival since we are traveling again. But we are only going as far north as Auburn Washington next year. We had pins at summer festival and will have them available at each dance we visit. Hope to see you at a dance soon! Petrina Buchheit
