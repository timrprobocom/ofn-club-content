Corvallis Squares fall lessons:  Mainstream lessons will be offered through Linn-Benton Community College, 7:30 - 9:00 p.m. at the Benton Center in Corvallis, Thursdays for 10 weeks starting October 3, ending December 13, and skipping Thanksgiving. Instructor, Bruce Lowther. Cost $79.

Our club was dark for July and also will be in August, but we're happy to see there are a variety of dances up and down the valley. 

We enjoyed a club potluck in May, and at the meeting we voted to continue our successful 'yearly dance pass' for the 2019/2020 dance season. This will cover all of the Corvallis Squares dances, including the coast trip which is the 2nd weekend of March. The yearly pass will cost $80. 

We look forward to our fall lessons through Linn-Benton Community College. We've found that most new dancers have been personally invited by a club member, so we're focusing on that and also decided to hold an introductory open-invitation all-comers dance at our September 14 dance. Charlotte Jeskey and Sandy Harris have agreed to call squares and line dances appropriate for all-comers. Feel free to invite folks! 

Our club will hold another potluck in August. We hope you're enjoying summer in Oregon; some say nothing else can compare!  Karen
