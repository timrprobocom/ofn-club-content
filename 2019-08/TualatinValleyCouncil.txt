The Hahn Barn Dance on June 29th was a huge success!  Scott Zinser did a great job of keeping everyone on their toes with Ken Pratt providing a stellar performance with the rounds. Weather was perfect, and of course, plenty of good food provided by all the great cooks.  There were New dancers and many who had never been to the Barn Dance before.  Thanks to Joanne Switzer the treasurer for TVC and to Leslie Tallman and John Semm for helping at the door.  There were 7 squares on the floor for most of the evening.  The Sunset Promenaders took home the TVC Banner for the club with the highest percentage of members present with the Hoedowners a close second.  Thanks also goes to Gary and Bette Hahn for graciously hosting the event on their farm.  As usual, Tom & Janice were in the thick of things helping out wherever they could.  
 The TVC has welcomed a new club to our Council, the Oak Hills Squares.  They dance at the Oak Hills Recreation Center with club caller Lane Clem.  See report below.  The TVC now boasts 14 member square dance clubs, the largest Council in the State!
 Our next Council event is a fifth Saturday Dance, held at the Aloha Grange on August 31st. This dance will feature Daryl Clendenin calling with Connie Clark cueing.  The dance begins with pre-rounds at 7:30 followed by Mainstream with rounds at 8:00.  Every third tip will be Plus.  This dance is co-hosted by the Valley Squares.
