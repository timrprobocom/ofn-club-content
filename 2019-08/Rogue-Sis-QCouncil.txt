Rogue Sis Q Council has put out a challenge to all out there in the dancing community.  We are having a Raise the Roof Benefit dance for Beachcombers in Port Orford.  We are donating ALL proceeds from this three-day event, the first weekend in August, to Beachcombers to help repair their roof.  If any of you have danced at Beachcombers hall, it’s wonderful.  The wood floors are wonderful to dance on, and the beautiful coast line has multiple site to visit while there.  Battle Rock weekend is Labor Day every year, where we dance in the surf on Saturday morning, camp out at the hall on a beautiful grassy area, play cards in the hall during non-dancing times, and have fun with fellow dancers.  The Sunday morning breakfast is restaurant style, site down and be served. Rogue Sis Q Council would like to help them keep their hall going and are challenging anyone and everyone to have a benefit dance to help a club in need.

We have new officers in place for Rogue Sis Q Council: President- Roberta Claudson, Vice-President Phil Claudson, Secretary- Lorri McIntosh, Treasurer- Debbie Creton, Federation delegate- Garrett “Blake” Smith.

Rogue Sis Q youth dance had a great time dancing to Dean Black from Yreka, Ca on July 12.  Our next dance is July 10, 2020.  We have the dance every year in July.
