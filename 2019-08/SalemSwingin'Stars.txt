We Dance all year!  Come join us in our air conditioned hall for three dances in August.  Our regular dances are the first and third Saturdays of the month. We will also have a 5th Friday Plus dance on August 30.

July was a fun month with a demo dance on July 4 at Lancaster Village followed by great food. Our 4th of July on the 5th dance had a patriotic theme and four squares on the floor.  We went dark for July 19 so we could all be at Blanchet in Salem for Summer Festival.

Mark your calendars for our Annual Corn-n-Cluck dance set for Friday September 21. That crazy chicken has something up his wing and you do not want to miss it.  $8.00 for dinner and dancing. See you all on the Dance Floor. Sheila Machado
