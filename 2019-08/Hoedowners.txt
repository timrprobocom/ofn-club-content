 Hoedowners had a busy June.  Our Strawberry dance was well attended and everyone enjoyed the Strawberries, cake, and ice cream after the dance.
 On Movie night Cinderella and Price Charming came and danced the night away.  Dorothy and Toto got lost from her yellow brick road and stopped by for directions and after a few dances we helped them get back on the path to find the Wizard.
 Coming in August we have the Roaring 20's dance with Randy Dibble calling while Daryl is away.  We will cool off with Ice Cream Sundaes.  For our Summer's End dance Daryl will be back and Ken Pratt will be cueing.  We will serve melons and fruit at the break.
