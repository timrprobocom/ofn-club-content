Greetings from Yreka. Even though our Gold Diggers dance was "intimate" in a manner of speaking we had a great time. It was good to see Lawrence and catch up. A BIG thank you to all of the Star Promenaders that attended and made our dance. Lots of good food, fellowship, and dancing. Congratulations to Francis Ramey on winning the gold filled necklace. I hope you all have marked your calendars for our birthday dance with Eric Henerlau and Rikki Lobato. The dance will be M/S, Plus and Adv.  Please look for fliers for more info. Also be sure to check it out and look for another special one of a kind necklace to be raffled off at the dance, and like our Gold Diggers you do not have to be present to win. Tickets are now available.
We have been very busy this summer. We started a "Square Dance 101" session and have had great success going on 3 weeks now and have 3 squares including some past members who are now getting back into dancing again. I am so excited to see new, and familiar faces. Some of which are dancers from my past teachings in Etna, Seiad, Happy Camp, Mt Shasta, and Yreka. Check out our Facebook page for pics and videos. This has all been made possible by efforts of our president Marcia, one of our returning dancers Debbie and great cooperation from the Karuk Tribe. Our county fair will begin August 7th and we will have our "Pepsi trailer" there selling drinks. This is always a lot of work and fun.  It is a major boost for our club revenue. We plan on dancing Friday night and everyone is welcome. If you would like more info on anything we are doing feel free to contact Marcia, Sherrie or myself.
Hope to see you on the floor !
