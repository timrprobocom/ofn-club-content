 Our Plus classes have ended and we are enjoying newcomers who are adding to the fun of square dancing.  I hope they enjoyed us. Please welcome these newcomers when they visit your club.
 Hahn Barn Dance had beautiful weather and Gary and Bette were wonderful hosts even transporting some folks up and down the hill making sure that all had an opportunity to visit the pond.  They deserve a big Thanks!  The pot luck was excellent and the desert table overflowed with delicious treats.  Over seventy people enjoyed dancing to the calling of Scott Zinser and cueing of Ken Platt
 Planning the TVC New Yearâ€™s Dance is underway by the hosts Eager Beavers and Sunset Promenaders.  The colors this year are black, silver, and red so you can start thinking about which party outfit you will wear.  
 The good food and gentle activities are yours at our August 14th picnic at Noble Woods Park in Hillsboro from 3 pm to dusk.  Remember to bring your chairs to rest in the shade after a vigorous game of holey board baseball and mental stress of guessing how many jellybeans are in the jar.  Bring a dish to share.  
 We dance on most holidays. Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 p.m. - 3:00, at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Portland.  Please check for up to date information at www.EagerBeavers.info.
