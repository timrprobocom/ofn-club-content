It was great dancing on our outdoor floor on July 6th. Jim Hattrick did a great job of introducing some non-dancers to the activity we so love to do. Lynn Wunische, our line dance instructor, introduced new people to her favorite activity and drew quite a crowd. We enjoyed good food, great dancing, fine fellowship with other dancers, and nice weather.

August should bring more opportunities to dance under the stars. We thank Marc and his many volunteers for the hard work put into getting the outdoor floor ready this year. 

Lynn is continuing to teach line dancing over the summer on Thursdays at 6:00 PM. Then in the fall, we will begin mainstream square dance lessons on September 12th with Scott Zinser at 7:30 PM every Thursday. Hopefully, some students will come to both.

On August 9th, you will find the Country Cut-Ups serving ice cream at the Boring and Dull Day celebration in the Boring Station Trailhead Park in Boring. There are lots of activities there, live music, and free ice cream, so come check it out, from 5:00 to 8:30 PM.

It is always fun to dance at the Barn and never Boring! Come join us!  There are lots of activities there, live music, and free ice cream, so come check it out, from 5:00 to 8:30 PM.
