The Valley River Dancers dance Plus on 2nd Fridays, and Mainstream on 4th Fridays in Newberg at the Chehalem Community Center, located on the corner of 2nd and Howard Streets.  We dance ‘A’ on 5th Saturdays at the Woodburn Senior Estates Community Club.  Randy Dibble is our Caller.  Ken Pratt cues 2nd Friday; Sherri Clark cues 4th Friday. https://www.valleyriverdancers.org
 A round dance workshop continues preceding our 2nd Friday dance, led by Ken and Dianne Pratt, beginning at 6:30 pm. Come work on your round dancing moves with us.
 Our Mainstream August 23rd theme is Tropical Escape.  Some of our neighboring clubs are dark in August, and we hope you will come join us for a fun, casual night of upbeat dancing.
