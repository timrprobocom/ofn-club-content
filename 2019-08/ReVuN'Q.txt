The club had a birthday dance in June to celebrate 43 years of existence. We had chocolate cake, brownies, and ice cream with all sorts of toppings to decorate to your heart’s content. Yum!

We are continuing our summer schedule of dancing two hours and only stopping to work on a troublesome step. It seems to be working for those that make the session.

July was a short month for us since we were dark for the 4th and dark on the 18th for the Trails In dance for Summer Festival. We danced on July 11th and also on the 25th.

We hope to have had a short meeting on July 11 to decide what we are doing for the fall season and to either change our start time or to keep the 6:30 time we currently have. We’ll let you know what we decided. Marilyn Schmit
