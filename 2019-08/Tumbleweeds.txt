I will start out with the good news.  Our VP Ken Schrock is back from surgery and has danced one full dance.  He is a great inspiration in so many ways.  We love you Ken.

The news of our Club is not as good.  Our Club is small at this time, down from at least 60 at one time; however we do have four new members.  All of us are older and dance a little slower than some Clubs.  Actually this could and should appeal to dancers who have quit because their Clubs have closed or new people coming in from other places. All former dancers from wherever, come and bring friends and neighbors that fit our group.  Let's keep square dancing alive in Portland.

One other thing, we have several couples that come to our Club for Round Dancing.  We have a period of time that is used for Round Dancing (two cues between tips).  This is very popular with our guests.  Come and give us a try.  We have lunch after and air condition and lots of parking and we are a friendly group.
