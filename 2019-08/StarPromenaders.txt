Well, Diamond Lake is in the record books; at least it will be when  you read this, since it is still the week before Diamond Lake when I am writing this.  The weather was good, and not too many mosquitoes(I hope). I am also going to, optimistically, hope there was no smoke. Writing this "blurb" ahead of time, can be a challenge, so I hope I am not too far off on the information I am sending your way. 
The next "Game Night" will be on August 9. There is a lot going on in the month of July and we did not want to step on any toes. The theme will be "Sandwich Fixins." Come out and join us. It is a "Hoot." If you don't play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on or if there is some other "game" you would like to play, let us know. We are open to most any table game. We always have a potluck with a them.
Phil Ramey will pick up the "Back to Basics" dance on August 16, then on August 24 will be the annual "Ramey RoundUp."
Classes are going to start on Thursday, September 12. Remember - the First 5 lessons are "Free."
