 Valley Squares have decided to drop our first Saturday night dance starting in August, 2019.  Our only dance in August will be on the 17 with the theme "Back to School", please bring school supplies.  Our dance format will remain the same:  Mainstream or floor level from 7-8:30 pm and Plus from 8:30 to 9:30-ish pm.  
 Our classes have ended.  We are helping Hoedowners recruit new dancers for their Sept 10th classes.  
 Take care and keep dancing,
  Carolene Siebert
