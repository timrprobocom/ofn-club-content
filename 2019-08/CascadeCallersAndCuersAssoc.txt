For one of our CCCA members, Larry Dupray, who passed away, a memorial picnic and gathering will be held at Island Park, the south shelter in Springfield.  10:00 A.M. - 2:00  This was supposed to be Wolf Pack's annual picnic, but the decision was made to honor Larry in the atmosphere of fun and camaraderie.  Larry started the Wolf Pack back in 1998 on Valentine's Day.  Because of his health he had not been able to call the past year or so.  Sandy Harris and Lennie Ludiker have been calling.  Christina remains cuer.  Please attend if you are able.  It is wheelchair accessible. My late husband, Kirby Goode, helped Larry with his calling when he first started.  We miss them both.  Sharon Greenman cued for the Wolf Pack as well and is sorely missed. 

CCCA voted not to hold a dance August 31.  Too many folks are gone for Labor Day.  It's also my birthday, so I will take a friend to my favorite restaurant.

The hall board bought Dan Nordbye's new ElectroVoice speakers for the main hall.  We have tried them out, and they sound great!  Dan used them 45 minutes when he decided they were too big for him to tote around.  We got a great deal on them.  Thanks Dan!

We have meetings and dances on the fifth Saturdays of each year.   Our board remains the same as last year.  Pat Cox - President , Jackie Gale, - Vice-President, Gail Jackson - Treasurer and Christina Corelli - Secretary.

Keep on calling and cueing for fun,
Christina Corelli
