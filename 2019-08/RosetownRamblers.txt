The Ramblers have enjoyed a summer of R&R. We’ve planned a club outing to the Portland Mercado on August 17. At that time, we’ll make plans to welcome a new group of students for our fall lessons. We’ll start with a free introduction to square dancing at 7 pm on August 28, at the Bridgeport United Church of Christ, 621 NE 76th Ave., Portland. The lessons will continue Wednesday evenings from 7-8:30, at Bridgeport UCC. All are welcome!

Speaking of welcomes, you haven’t truly lived until you’ve experienced a Ramblers fall fly-in, which we call Scares and Squares. Our theme this year is Legends of the Fall. We will have three of the finest callers in square dance history: Barry Clasper (Toronto), Chris Phillips (South Florida), and Gary Monday (Seattle). The event takes place in charming Multnomah Village, at the Multnomah Arts Center, 7688 SW Capitol Highway, Portland. The dates are October 25-27.

SYIAS!
