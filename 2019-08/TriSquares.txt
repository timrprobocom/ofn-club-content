In June we visited the Chaps and Petticoats in Aurora, where our caller Terry Halley and our cuer Sandra Pinion led the dance.  Also in June we had our last two club dances of the summer, because in July and August we’re dark due to the heat.
 In August we’re planning two visitations:  to the Sunset Promenaders on Saturday the third, and to the Hoedowners on Saturday the 24th.  Also we have scheduled a square dancing demo-dance for the public at the Tigard Library on August 17th at 1:00.  To round out the summer we’re having our club’s annual potluck picnic at Snyder Park in Sherwood, relaxing up on the hill, under the shady trees.
