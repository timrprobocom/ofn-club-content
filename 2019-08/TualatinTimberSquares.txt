During our last two dances in May, our caller tried out a few new songs, including one that was suggested by one of our frequent guests.  Our cuer also did some new songs as well.  Love the variety.
 Our dances in July are on the 10th and the 24th.  And, as usual, we will be serving refreshments downstairs right after every dance.  
 Summer will be in full swing in July, and so a reminder: if the temperature on the day of the dance reaches 90 degrees or above, we may cancel the dance.  We will let everyone know when this happens.
 Our club continues to be a fun place where friends gather, have some food and practice moves they want to work on before the weekend dances.  Lots of belly laughs to go around.  We would love to have you come join us!
 See you around in a square
