Hello dancers.  Are you having the opportunity to dance with other clubs as you are out on summer travels?  Though we experience different styles, square dancing has the same moves all around the world.  Our caller, Craig Abercrombie said he and Judy danced on the Great Wall in China.  Another friend told me about dancing to an Asian caller, the accent was difficult for dancers to understand but since she had been raised around Asian speakers she was able to understand the calls so she would repeat to her square and they didn't miss a beat.
 Have I mentioned that R Square D has moved from the Washington Sou'Wester Council to the Evergreen Council?  Our closeness to Vancouver/Portland make it easier for more members to participate in Council activities.  Chris Poole and Sandy Sims are our Evergreen representatives.  We are now members of both the TVC and the Evergreen Councils.
 Hard to believe I am already writing about August dances!  And school time around the corner.  We will be collecting school supplies at our August 14th dance, if you help with this donation cause please include the sales receipt for our tax purposes.
 August 28th will be our "Last Hurrah" for summer dancing.  Root beer floats will be our treat for the evening.  For your comfort, dance attire through the summer, is casual.
 Summer news and info will be on our website: www.r-square-d.info  2nd and 4th Wednesday.  Dance times:  7pm - 8pm Plus with advanced rounds, 8pm - 9:30pm Mainstream with rounds.  106 NW 8th Ave, Kelso, WA 98626 by the Rotary spray park at the intersection of Hwy 4 and W Main, Kelso/Longview. 
 "See you in a square!",
