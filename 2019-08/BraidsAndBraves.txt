It was great to get back to dancing at the McMinnville Grange in June! We had a Beach theme with beach balls, funky glasses and beach scene panels where you could have your photo taken. Shorts and wild shirts were the costume of the evening, which was warm. We had two squares and visitors from Sunset Promenaders, Toe Draggers and Valley River Dancers. 

We'll be dark until September but camped out with the Toe Draggers in Vernonia in July. Who knows, we might show up at your dance sometime soon!  Carmen
