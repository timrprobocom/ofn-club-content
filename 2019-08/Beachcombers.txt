As some of you may know, the Beachcomberâ€™s Cove in Port Orford is in need of a new roof.

We have found a contractor and plan to have the roof finished before the first rains. So far we have raised about a third of the costs utilizing a number of local fundraisers. We have a number of upcoming fundraising events planned for the rest of the summer, including our Battle Rock Weekend during Labor Day.

Hope to see you on the dance floor!
