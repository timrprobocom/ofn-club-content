We are continuing lessons and still have 4 more before they are ready to dance SSD.  Weâ€™re hoping to start another class in June.  We are still not having much attendance at our dances and have canceled the last two.  Our next scheduled dance is June 4th but we will cancel as that is also the night of the Lebanon Strawberry Festival dance. So our next dance will be the 4th Saturday, June 25th.
