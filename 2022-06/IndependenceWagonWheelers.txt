The club had two dances in April and each dance had two to three squares in attendance. There is still lots of room for more people to come and join us. On the first Saturday of June and July, we will be dancing at the Salem Square Dance Center since the Polk County Fairgrounds has been rented out for each of those weekends.

Our cuer, Patty Hermann, has been in the hospital but by the time this is published, she should be well on her way to feeling better. Send your good vibes her way to stay that way. Our backup cuer, Molly Fairly, is down with no voice and a bad cough, so she needs good vibes also.  

We had a club meeting in May and information about what was decided concerning upcoming dances, lessons, etc. will be reported later. 

The annual Koast Krash was held in late April with 24 dancers attending. A small crowd but lots of fun.  “Rock Around the Clock” was the theme with hamburgers, hot dogs, and root beer floats being served, and, of course, the “dress” of the times included rolled-up sleeves, cuffed jeans, and poodles on outfits. Two couples stepped up to chair next year’s event, so stay tuned for more info closer to the occasion.
