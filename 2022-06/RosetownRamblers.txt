The Rosetown Ramblers celebrated our 39th graduation on Saturday, May 14, at Oak Grove Community Center. Eric Henerlau called a fun and energetic dance--we even got everyone up on the floor for a line dance between square dance tips! 

In addition to our 16 Social Square Dance graduates, we welcomed 10 dancers from Happy Hoppers (who took home a banner!) and friends from Country Cut-ups, Tam Twirlers, and B&Bs. We were thrilled to see the return of several Ramblers from pre-COVID days.

We gave special recognition to our instructor Rick Hawes, who taught this class of students and kept them coming back every week for more. We also made Daryl Clendenin an Honorary Rambler to thank him for filling in several weeks when Rick was unable to teach, for his mentoring of Rick, his encouragement of our students, and his support of our club.

We asked our students what they like most about dancing with the Ramblers, and here's a sampling of what they said:

    All the funny little things that occur during a tip and how lovely everyone is.
    Feeling accomplished after a good dance.
    Making friends with a spunky group of fantastic people.
    Snacks!
    Everyone moving in synch, moving rhythmically to create something bigger than the individual dancers in the community.
    Dancing raises my spirits no matter what my mood was at the start of the night.
    A warm and welcoming dancing community that is really fun.
   Exuberance!

You'll have a chance to see what the fun is all about at our June dance, on Saturday, June 11, at Oak Grove Community Center, with Don Wood calling. We start at 7 pm and alternate Social Square Dance and Plus tips. This is our Pride dance, so any combination of rainbow attire is encouraged. (Note, however that all Ramblers dances are casual--come as you are and dress how you feel comfortable!). 

Happy dancing wherever you may be!

SYIAS!
