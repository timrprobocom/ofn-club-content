It's so good to be dancing with our club again!  In April we had weekly refresher workshops for our members on Sunday afternoons, and we were quite surprised at how much "muscle memory" we'd lost over the past two years. 

At one of the refreshers we held our annual General Meeting and election of new officers, in person! (Not Zoom.)  President, Dale Brabham.  Vice President, Carol Roos.  Secretary, John Prouty.  Treasurer, Edith Prouty.  Dance Coordinator, Lynnea Loveberg.  And TVC Reps, Charles McAuley and Michael Smith.  Congratulations to them and many thanks to the outgoing officers! 

In June we're having our first two official dances since before the pandemic, on the 12th and 26th, both on Sunday afternoons at 3:00 at the Tigard Grange.  Our caller, Terry Halley and cuer, Sandra Pinion providing guidance.  (Please check our dance fliers for the latest on masks, cost, and refreshments.)

Come join us!  Because as you may remember, in July and August we are always dark, due to the heat in the grange.  Also, breaking news - our board has decided to return to Friday night dances in September (2nd & 4th Fridays), the time of evening yet to be determined.
