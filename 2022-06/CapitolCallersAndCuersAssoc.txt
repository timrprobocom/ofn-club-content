The club hosted the Spring Fling on April 30 with a small attendance. The three callers and three cuers did a great job of keeping the others dancing. There were door prizes available and snacks too!

We had a meeting on May 15 with the election of officers and are searching for a new Vice President since ours chose not to renew their membership. We are thinking about plans for the fall and possible workshops during meetings in the fall.

We are always looking for more members to join us so if you cue or call and are in the Mid-Willamette area, seek out one of our officers and come to one of our meetings to find out what we are about. The next meeting is on the third Sunday of September at 1:30 p.m. Marilyn
