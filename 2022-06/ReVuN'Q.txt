We finished the Jive class on April 21 and had a sparsely attended workshop/review the following week with Leonard Snodgrass as a substitute instructor. Our regular instructor was scheduled to have a hip replacement on April 27, but the doctors postponed it at the last minute, and we are still waiting for a new date. Until then, we are dancing and workshopping from 7-9 p.m. on Thursdays until then. No classes will be held until after Randyâ€™s surgery and recuperation.

Our next class will be announced soon. Options include slow two-step, bolero, and west coast swing. We will see what we come up with, but it is looking like slow two-step may win out. After the pace of the jive, something slower sounds nice.
