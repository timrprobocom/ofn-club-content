We continue to dance twice a month depending on hall availability and dancer availability.  We dance from 1:30 to 3:30 on Sunday afternoons.  Please check our website at cas-sd.yo9lasite.com to see our schedule of dances.  To be on the safe side a few days before a dance, please call Fred Beisse at 541-520-7311 if you are not on his email list to find out if we are dancing for sure.  We dance in Hall B with its entrance behind the building at 2095 Yolanda, Springfield.

Since we do not have a caller, Fred finds recorded tips for us to dance to, done by national callers like Daryl Lipscomb and, Bronc Weiss and others.  When we run into difficulty, he halts the recording and we go over the call that caused a problem.  In general he chooses recordings at the appropriate level so we can just dance and not workshop.  However, we all like to be pushed a little to improve our skills.

Right now due to the pandemic we are not sharing food or beverages, and hand sanitizer is always available.  Please come join us if you are dancing at the advanced level for a fun two hours of camaraderie and good dancing.
