We had a small dance for our Fifth Saturday Dance, but boy, oh, boy, did people have FUN!  We had our meeting beforehand and took care of a lot of business.  It'd been a while since our dance could happen. 

Janet Geiger had not been feeling well, and we hope she is much better now.  Lennie Ludiker and Sheila are retired from CCCA.  We thank Lennie for his many years of service and wish them well.  Roger and Linda Puztler were in California for a wedding and then on a cruise on the Pacific Ocean that was proposed because of COVID.  Gail Jackson had suffered a fall and cracked a bone in her leg.  We wish her a speedy recovery.  Cherie and Pat Cox, Sandy Harris, Tim Matteson and Christina called and cued.  Mike and Camille Kious could not attend, and we wish them good health.  There is so much happening these days.

Our next CCCA Fifth Saturday dance is July 30.
