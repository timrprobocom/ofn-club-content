June has come. School will wind up this month and some clubs will be finishing up their dance schedule and going “dark” for the summer. This may be the year to change that around and keep dancing because we got a late start to the dance year.

This is also the time of year that clubs look to starting their classes in September. This the perfect time to prepare for classes.  Start getting flyers made up and distributed and start talking to friends and neighbors about square dancing. We need to build our dancer base. If your club dances through the summer, bring non-dancing friends to observe the dances.  They will see how much fun we have and enjoy our fellowship and comradery. 
       
Hope to see you in a square soon and…..

Let’s Start Dancing Again
