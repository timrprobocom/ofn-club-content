Silver City Squares hosted a Teen Square Up the first weekend of May at the Waldo Hills Community Club.  Friday night consisted of dancing and an open mic opportunity for any youth interested.  We had three squares dancing and had the pleasure of listening to many youth have their chance on the stage calling.  Saturday started early with breakfast followed by competitive calling, cueing and round dancing.  Mixed in with the competition, the youth lined danced and bonded with one another.  Right before lunch, two squares earned their Running Bear fun badges and one super skilled square earned the designation of the Last Square Standing.  After lunch they danced to mystery squares, both mainstream and plus.  Even the adults on the sidelines were impressed with their dancing abilities.  Awards were given to the youth who competed in calling, cueing and round dancing.  Saturday night after dinner, the dancers randomly picked their roles on the dance floor and gave it their best shot in positions they weren’t necessarily familiar with.  From there we were dancing three squares to more youth on the stage.  The weekend was full of dancing, friendship, laughs and smiles.  A big THANK YOU to the adults who made it all happen - Bob and Lois Wachter kept us fed, Ian Craig was our energetic M.C., Don Benson and Terry Haley called a few tips and Julie Stiers cued a few rounds.  And of course, Karyn Buchheit organized the entire event.
