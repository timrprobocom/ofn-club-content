On May 6-7 C&P members helped Silverton who hosted the Teen Festival weekend.  Chaps also had a May 6th dance - we wanted to support our caller and cuer, Scott Zinser and Stephanie Lozano, so we rallied our members & friends, via email, to turn out.  We were pleasantly surprised to have two squares; some friends we had not seen (and they had not danced) since COVID.  Friends matter!

Five members of Chaps and Petticoats attended the PAC 5th Friday dance on April 29th, co-hosted by Bachelor and Bachelorettes at Abernethy Grange.  Thank you to the Glidewells, for making the long journey and sharing your enthusiasm with us - our squares had fun.

Our ‘no theme’ dance on April 15th, with just two squares, was sooo much fun with Ian Craig calling and Tom Klug cueing - also Deb Klug did a guest tip.  Lots of smiles made for lots of energy!

The Chaps and Petticoats last dance of the season will be Friday, June 3rd - our Club Caller, Scott Zinser, opens with PLUS at 7:30pm, calls MS 8 -10:00 PM and Julia Buchheit cues Rounds - come shake a leg!   Chaps have decided to go DARK for our June 17th dance AND join the ToeDraggers’ LAST dance-party, as their Club will retire!  Sad but true.

For the July and August months, Chaps and Petticoats will be DARK - we will dance with other Clubs and promote/advertise our MS lessons (introductions on Sept. 11th and 18th are FREE).  

Happy Feet,
