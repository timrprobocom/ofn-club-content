The Oak Hills squares continue to meet every Monday at the gym in the Oak Hills neighborhood.

Lessons are from 6.30-7.30 and mainstream dancing is from 7.30-8.30pm.

We currently have 9 people taking lessons and they are progressing nicely and more importantly having fun.

Our caller is Mark Wheeler, who is doing an amazing job teaching our new members; adapting and evolving the lessons to make them fun and entertaining.

On the first Monday of every month, we will have a themed dance from 7.30-9.00pm and we invite dancers from other clubs to attend.

On Monday June 6th our theme will be “Here comes Summer!” as we all look forward to some sunshine and less rain. We will be serving sweet treats and hope to see lots of dancers from other clubs.

We have really enjoyed having some visitors join our dances. It’s great to meet other dancers, make new friends and share some laughs. It feels as though everything is finally getting back to normal.

On that note however, we do require all dancers to be vaccinated and wearing of masks is optional.
