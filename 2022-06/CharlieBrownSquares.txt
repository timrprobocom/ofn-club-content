Classes are going well and we have a nice group going through the new SSD class.  We've had some fun dances with one more regular dance in May on the 21st with Chuck Simpkins & Mary Nutt. Memorial Weekend is going to be a wonderful party with our Boatnik Festival - 3 days of dancing with the amazing Eric Henerlau & Dan (Allison) Drumheller!!!  We are also doing the jet boat ride on Monday morning.  Still time to get your ribbons; or plan to purchase at the door!

We have 2 dances in June with Roger Putzler & Rikki on June 4th and Wayne Weaver & Bob Dingman on the 18th. Lots of fun!!

We hope to see you in Southern Oregon soon! 

Happy Dancing!
