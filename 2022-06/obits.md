A celebration of life will be held for Ralph Lambert on Saturday, June 11, 2022 at the Polk County Fairgrounds, located at 520 S. Pacific Hwy, West, Rickreall, OR in building “B” which is the Arts and Craft building at 3:30pm.  All are invited to come and share their special thoughts regarding Ralph’s life.

The Independence Wagon Wheelers invite anyone that would like to attend their regular dance to join them in that same hall starting at 7pm that night.  If you no longer dance but wish to visit with fellow dancers or observe square and round dancing, please join us.
