Happy Spring!

We had three dances in April. So many smiles. It is great to be able to gather and to bring food to the dances again.

Elections were held and our new officers were installed on May 14. President-Bob Whaley, Vice President-Keith Waterhouse, Secretary-Vanessa Ellis, Treasurer-Sheila Machado, Membership Chair-Terry McCarty, Area Delegate-Celinda Gourley, Sunshine-Diane Webster, OFN Reporter-Sheila Machado, Newsletter Editor-Keith Waterhouse. Congratulations and thank you for stepping up to lead our club for the next year.

Our Mainstream Beginner class of 13 students is progressing at a good clip.  We plan on graduating our students in the first week of June.

We invited our class to our 1st Friday Dance on May 6.  Seven of them attended and they did a fantastic job. Four of them are ages 8-11.  So much fun to have the young ones and their energy.

We dance year-round on the first, third, and fifth Fridays of the month. Please plan on joining us.
