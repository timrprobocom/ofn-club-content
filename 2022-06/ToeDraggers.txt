Toe’s enjoyed our first regular dance (in quite some time) on April 15th.  We had 12 visitors and 14 members attending.

The 1st TVC dance in 2 years was held at the Kinton Grange, April 30th. Toe’s hosted 44 dancers. It was fun to see so many dancers on the floor having a good time. KC and 3 guest callers kept it lively and Julie Stiers kept the rounds going around.

Because of declining membership and poor health, the Toe Draggers have made the difficult decision to close down operations.  After 47 years, June 17 will be our final dance.  It will be a free dance, with KC Curtis and Darrell Kalmbach calling, and Tami Helms cuing.  Our many decorations will be offered free after the dance to those who can use them.  Come help us say goodbye at the Kinton Grange, 5 ½ miles west of Washington Square, on Scholls Ferry Rd.
