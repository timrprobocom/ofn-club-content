The Country Cut-Ups square and round dance every 1st, 4th, and 5th Saturday nights at the Boring Barn, with Plus from 7:00 to 7:30 PM on 1st and 4th Saturdays, followed by Mainstream. 5th Saturdays are all Plus level. Come on out and join us. If the weather ever gets warm enough, we will get out on the outdoor dance floor.

If you get this in time, we are having our annual Barn Sale on May 20th and 21st from 9:00 to 4:00. If it is already past, we thank you for your support.

For our community, we are offering line dancing every week on Thursdays from 5:00 for beginners and 6:00 for more experienced dancers, but all are welcome to come to both hours for only $5. This is taught by Lynn Wunische. Don and Michelle Garwood are teaching Cowboy Two Step on Friday evenings from 6:30 PM. This is not round dancing two step, this is the one where guys learns to lead and gals learn to follow. Bring a partner and the cost is $7 for the two of you. For more information, call (503)334-8141.

If you read this in time, Robert and Young Lumsden are celebrating their 45th anniversary with a FREE dance on May 22nd at 2:00 PM at the Boring Barn.

See you in a square,
