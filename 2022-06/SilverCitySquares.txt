We have 29 students in the process of graduating and joining the club, three adults and the rest are youth.

Our Teen Square Up had a turnout of just over three squares for Friday and Saturday!!! The kids all had a lot of fun with several of them trying out the mic with some pre-written patter figures. The youth who did singing calls were all good. Benjamin, Noah, and Phoebe were all first timers performing their singing calls outside of the class situation. Petrina and Yesenia did a duet on “Colors of the Wind”, but they refused to sign up to be judged. Thomas, as the only "experienced" youth caller signed up to be judged and did both a singing call and patter as well as teaching an obsolete call. We had four couples take part in the round dance part of being judged. None of the kids wanted to be judged as squares, but they did try doing some pre-recorded hoedowns. They did well for never trying that before.

Julia was the only youth cuer signed up.  She did a memorized 2-step; hash cueing in both 2-step and waltz; and cold cueing in both 2-step and waltz. Julie Stiers tried out doing cold cueing too. Thank you for trying something new.

For the most part, our club officers will remain the same for this next year.

Karyn is scheduling some club floor time and activities for over the summer as we are officially dark in June, July, and August. We are also starting to plan for lessons in September as we are already getting calls and questions about these. 

Our youth will be running the concession stand at the summer festival - stop by and say "Hello" and pick up a snack! We will have a large variety of offerings on the menu.
