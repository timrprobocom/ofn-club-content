It seems so good to be back to clogging on a regular basis now and without masks.  We have a good-sized group regularly coming and we are now preparing for our demo season. Our first demo is at World Beat at the Waterfront Park in Salem on June 26 from 11:45 a.m.to 12:45 p.m.  We then dance at the Marion County Fair on July 10 from 2:00-3:00 p.m.  At the end of that week, we will perform for the Salem Art Fair on July 16 from 4:30 - 5:30 p.m. and again on July 17 from 2:15 - 3:00 p.m. There may be one or two others as the summer progresses.  Would love to have many of you there. 

We have hopes of recruiting several new people who wish to try out clogging for our beginner classes in the Fall.
