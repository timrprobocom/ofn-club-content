The Winona Grange finally got to celebrate their 125th anniversary!  They originally planned to have a party in September 2020 but Covid interfered. The program started upstairs with "speeches” from  the Mayor, the State Grange President and descendants of some of the founding families.  The group then moved downstairs for free ice cream sundaes, garden seeds and Grange history displays.  It was a fun morning and we even learned a few new tidbits about the place we have called home since 1985. 

Just a reminder that M&M’s are dancing June 4th and June 18th but we will be going dark thru the summer -  starting up again on September 17th.
