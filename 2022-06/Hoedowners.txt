I am still in shock for the ghastly weather we had in April. April Showers? It was a repetitive deluge with moments of drizzle.  Thank goodness we have distractions like square dancing to keep us sane and on the move. 

On April 9th we held the Hoedowner Appreciation Dance. What a spectacularly fun evening.  The dance floor was FULL of 66 dancers. It was wonderful seeing everyone dancing and catching up on months of news.  Friends seeing and dancing with friends they hadn’t seen in months/years of Covid shutdown. We had Dan Nordbye and Randy on stage that evening keeping everyone moving.  We sure hope you didn’t miss it! And with our unscientific survey, we did come to a conclusion that sweets disappear from the buffet faster than carrot sticks and cheese slices.

On April 23rd Dan Nordbye once again joined Randy Lewis to keep us on our toes. We had a bit of sound issued which turned out to be electrical which turned out to be a PGE problem.  Chet was on it and called the company and it as resolved.  Crazy!  It didn’t prevent us from dancing much and gave us more visiting and chatter time.

Our round lessons are ongoing.  Stop by and join us on Tuesday evenings at 7.

Please join us for our regularly scheduled dances in June.  The 11th Scott Zinser will be calling and on June 25th we’ll welcome Randy Dibble.  Randy Lewis will cue each Saturday.
