We are still dancing on 1st & 3rd Saturday at the Odd Fellows Hall on Saturday night at 7pm. Mike and Julie Stout doing the work.  Also continuing on 1st & 3rd Thursday's of the month same time 7pm same place with Darrell Kalmbach calling Plus, Erin on the door taking your money, and Tami Helms cueing and her partner Tim Keck making sure Candy and I do "Some Beach" correctly.  Never happens but we love it.

Sunset Promenaders have elected new Officers and they are as follows. Judy Schnase President, Ed Mickelson Vice President, Secretary Dianne Pratt, and Lalani Radford Treasurer. They  will take over June 1st. Congrats to all of them and thank you for stepping up to take on the jobs.

We will be wrapping up lessons in June and our first dance on the 4th will be a beginners dance so everyone can bring their students and Mike will call to the floor.  We should have 6 students graduate so we are excited about that.
Our normal schedule is 1st and 3rd Saturday for Mainstream, 1st, 3rd, and 5th Thursday for Plus.  We dance at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro near 3rd and Main.  We no longer require proof of vaccination and masks are optional.  See our website for further information, http://sunsetpromenaders.com.

Thanks to all who support our dances.
