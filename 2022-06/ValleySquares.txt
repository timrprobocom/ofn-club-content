We are having such a great time with our new members.  They are fun to dance with.  Our 73rd Anniversary dance is May 21st.  I'll write more about it in next month's report as it hasn't happened as of this report.  We had a Members Meeting and dinner on May 3rd.  It was great to get together for a meal again.  Our Members have decided to change our dance format  starting with our anniversary dance, to 7 to 9:30 pm, Mainstream with every third tip Plus, and to begin providing snacks upstairs.  June we have Craig Abercrombie calling and Connie Clark cueing.  Hope to see you at our dances and have fun together.
