R Square D celebrated its 69th anniversary on April 8th and had visitors from quite a few clubs.  Everyone enjoyed Craig’s calling and Susan’s cueing.  It was nice to sit and visit with other dancers afterwards as we had cake and beverages – something we had not done since before the pandemic.

Lessons are scheduled to wrap up with graduation on May 16th.  We’ll take a break for the summer and plan to host new lessons in the fall.

In June we begin our summer schedule with dances on the second and fourth Wednesday in June, July, and August.  All of them involve ice cream after the dance!  June 8th is “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” with Craig Abercrombie calling and Susan Healea cueing.  If you have a shirt promoting your favorite baseball team, please wear it.  We will have root beer floats after the dance.  June 22nd is our “Strawberries & Ice Cream” dance with guest caller George Hermann and cuer Patty Hermann.

All of our summer dances are casual and our hall is air conditioned.  Masks are not required.  We dance at Kelso Senior Center, 106 NW 8th Ave, Kelso, WA.  Plus dancing with intermediate rounds are from 7-8 and Mainstream dance with phase II rounds from 8-9:30.  Hope to see you in a square!
