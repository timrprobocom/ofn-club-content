We are a mainstream club but do include some plus tips during the evening.  We also offer rounds.  Jim Hattrick is the caller on most of our fourth Fridays and Jackie Gale is always there to cue rounds.  

Our last dance on April 26 was called by Scott Zinser.  We always enjoy dancing to Scott’s calling.  We had just over two squares dancing that night. I’m told.  As there were several clubs dancing in April, people had a good variety of dancing to choose from.  Buccaneers danced the first and second Fridays, Whirl-A-Ways danced the 2nd and 3rd Saturdays and Wolf Pack continued to offer dances the 1st and 4th Saturdays as well as ongoing lessons on Saturdays from 4 to 6:30PM in Hall A.

Masks are no longer required but of course can be worn as dancers choose.  Hand sanitizer is always available.  The drinking fountain has been turned back on, and we are encouraging our members to bring snacks to share.

In May we are looking forward to a joint dance with the Whirl-A-Ways club on the second Saturday, May 14.  This will be the annual Mexican Fiesta Dance with taco bar to start at 7PM.  By the time you read this it will have taken place.  In June we will hold our annual Reigning Cats and Dogs dance with Jim Hattrick calling and Jackie Gale cueing on the 4th Friday.  This dance is a benefit dance for our local humane society, Greenhill, and we hope dancers will consider making cash donations or bringing donations of food or toys for the animal shelter’s homeless dogs, cats and other pets.   It should be a fun night of dancing.

See you in a square,
