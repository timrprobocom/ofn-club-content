The Hayshakers are continuing to dance on the 2nd and 4th Saturdays of every month from 7 until 9 p.m. at the Pacific Grange, 90475 Hwy 101, Cullaby Lake, at Warrenton, OR.
 We’ll have square dance lessons the first 1½ hours, then dance Mainstream the last ½ hour.  We are not accepting new dancers at this point, but hope to in the near future.  Our website is hayshakers.org
