Although we previously reported that we would be dancing in June, July, and August, at a recent club meeting it was voted to instead be dark for the summer. Instead, we are planning some fun activities and visitations. We are hopefully scheduling lessons in the Fall and will again be dancing on the third Saturday of each month at the McMinnville Grange beginning in September. Norma
