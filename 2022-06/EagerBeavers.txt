Eager Beavers 47th Anniversary Dance was held on April 25th and featured our callers and cuers Darrell Kalmbach, Jim Hattrick, and Jeanine Norden.  Federation president George Hermann took the stage as well for some three-part harmony.  We had 23 guests and a wonderful afternoon of dancing, as well as a visit from founding member Paul Swenson, still spry at age 100.

As of this writing, our Memorial Day Dance will be held on May 30th, with Jim Hattrick calling and cueing.  Red, white and blue attire is welcome!

Eager Beavers no longer requires proof of vaccination at our dances.

We dance every Monday afternoon from 1:00 to 3:00. For up-to-date information see our website at www.EagerBeavers.info.
