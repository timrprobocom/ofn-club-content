The Columbia River Dancers have tried a slightly different approach to lessons this year and it seems to be working well.  We start new beginner lessons the first Sunday of the month and intensify the number of calls taught at one time.  The second and third weeks are reviews of what was taught the prior week and new calls added such that by the end of the third week all of the basics are taught.  The last Sunday of the month is our Beginners Dance.  We invite beginners from ALL clubs to attend.  Jim Hattrick takes the first part of the dance and runs through the basic calls and reviews those calls that seem to be weak.  This also gives the angels a chance to see who needs help and make sure someone with experience is in the square to help keep it from totally breaking down.  The remainder of the dance is really a dance, not lessons. 

Those who are proficient continue to mainstream and those who need help can review the next three weeks.  With the help of the angels present, the dancers get to really experience the fun and joy of what square dancing is all about.  Our last dance had five squares of new and experienced dancers. 

Hawaii calls.  Our first Friday dance of June will be to honor the great state of 
Hawaii.  Come with that Mumu that you wore on that soft Hawaiian evening or the flowery golf shirt you like so much.  

Even though it is over by 3 days, our June 17th dance will be a red, white, and blue theme dance in honor of Flag Day.
