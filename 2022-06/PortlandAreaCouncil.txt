PAC's 5th Friday dance on April 29th, co-hosted by Bachelor and Bachelorettes at Abernethy Grange was well attended. The caller/cuer were Cece and Sarge Glidewell from Klamath Falls â€“ despite the rain, three squares were on the floor (and another square sitting).  Thank you to the Glidewells for making the rainy, long journey.
