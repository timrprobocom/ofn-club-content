Willamette Squares enjoyed their April dance, April Eggstravaganza! There was a variety of clubs represented and an Easter egg hunt during the break.

Our dance in May falls on National Brisket Day so what better theme for our dance than Briskets and Burgers! Come dance and enjoy a brisket burger or slider. Check out upcoming dance themes on our Facebook page and/or the flyer in the OFN. Our caller and cuer, Bruce Lowther and Judy Russell, are cruisin’ to Alaska and again to the Caribbean. They will be back to calling and cueing when they return. 

We are happy to report that our snowbird president, John Templin, has returned to Oregon from Arizona. 

We were sad to hear that Al Felde, long-time partner of our former caller Sandy Harris, has died. Our club sends its condolences to Sandy, her family, and her friends.

Please join us for our next dance on the fourth Saturday at the Salem Square Dance Center for a rock in’ good time and National Brisket Day Celebration!
