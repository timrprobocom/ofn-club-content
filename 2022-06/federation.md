Summer Festival is only 1 1/2 short months away.  If you haven’t bought your ribbons yet or made your hotel reservations, I hope you take a few minutes to take care of it this month by mailing your completed registration to the address listed. The committee is busy planning a great Summer Festival in Salem July 15-17, at Blanchet Catholic School and you won’t want to miss it.

Our weekend starts with a Trail’s End Dance on July 14th, at the Salem Square Dance Center  7:30-10 pm.  The square and round dance will be hosted by the ReVuNQ Round Dance Club and features Randy Lewis as the dance MC.  Callers and cuers from the floor are invited to participate in the fun.  The calling and cueing will be to the floor level.

Summer Festival starts on Friday at 2:00 pm with three days of continuous dancing, including workshops, introduction to different dance levels, and open mic opportunities. Check out the weekend’s schedule at www.2022.oregonsummerfest.org.  We have a great line up of Oregon and California callers and cuers in additional to our featured caller Pat Carnathan and featured cuer Rikki Lobato.

On Saturday, there will also be a special Educational Seminar at 4:00 pm in the Round Dance Hall discussing the function of the Oregon Federation of Square and Round Dance clubs and United Square Dancers of America and how they can help clubs and the individual dancer.  The Seminar will be led by Tim Roberts, OFSRDC Parliamentarian and other guests.

On Sunday, dancing will start in the Mainstream Hall at 9:00 am with caller KC Curtis and cuer Cathy Houston.  Rikki Lobato will be conducting a Round Dance Review between 9:00-11:00 am in the Round Dance Hall.  Back in our Mainstream Hall between 11:00-1:00 pm we will have a very special Trail’s Out Dance with Featured Caller Pat Carnathan and Featured Cuer Rikki Lobato.  You won’t want to miss this special day of dancing before you start your trek home.

The Silver City Youth will be selling food in the cafeteria starting Friday.  The menu will be posted on Facebook when it is available.

Daytime dancing will be casual dress.  Evening dancing will be square dance attire.  Please remember no cowboy boots or spike heels on the gym floors in the Mainstream and Plus Halls.

If you’d like to volunteer to help with Summer Festival, please contact Cece Glidewell at sargenceceg@outlook.com.

Weekend ribbons will be available at the door for $40 per person.  If you are unable to attend the entire weekend, you can purchase daily ribbons at the door.  Friday night will be $10; all day Saturday will be $20; and Sunday will be $10.
