Yes, we are back to dancing!  We dance every Sunday from 4 - 6.  Tim is a great caller and will call whatever level we can muster.  We've been dancing for a few weeks.  We have hand sanitizers on the tables and please bring your own water.  We invite you all to join us!  We're a fun bunch and have been gathering during the pandemic being masked and socially distanced just to visit and see each others' faces!

Please call our president, David, at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are, indeed, dancing.  Once in a blue moon we give up our dance time in order for the hall to rent it out for another event.
