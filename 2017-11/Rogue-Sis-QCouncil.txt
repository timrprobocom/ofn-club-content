The last report was written the middle of September, so a report on the Sept 29th Council Dance was not given. Unfortunately, there were several other functions at the same time. Among them were, The Medford Music Festival, the first day of hunting season and MaryAnn Callahan's Round Dance Weekend. We had a fair turnout and everyone had a good time. Scott Zinser is always great fun to dance to.

Now that new classes have started, PLEASE help our clubs by angeling. Angels are very important to the future of our clubs because they are the impression the new dancers get of the club. We need to help the newbies all we can.

At our last meeting, on Oct 10, we decided to try meeting on Tuesdays instead of Mondays, due to quite a few conflicts on Monday nights. We will revisit this schedule in April and see how it is going. We will keep you posted.

Don't forget to support the Council and the Clubs in the Rogue Valley.

The next Council meeting will be December 5, 2017 at Denny's Restaurant on Biddle Road at 4:30pm.

There are still "Learn to Square Dance" t-shirts available. I have quite a few 2x's. We have found the t-shirts are a great conversation starter.
