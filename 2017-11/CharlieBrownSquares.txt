The month of October has been filled with wonderful dancing & friendship.
New classes are going well with 11 students learning how much fun dancing is!!
We had 4 squares for our 1st Saturday dance on Oct 7th. Michael Kious from Gresham called for the first time at the Charlie's!! He was so excited - as he put it "a dream come true." Pretty cool!! It was also the 1st official cueing gig at the Charlie's for Rikki Lobato.  It was nice to see so many smiles and everyone having such a great time!!
Our 3rd Saturday dance will be on Oct 21st and we are excited to have Scot & Erin Byars calling/cueing for the very 1st time at the Charlie's!! We are hoping for a great turnout and plan to have a great time.  You still have time to come down (or up) for this great dance!! Will report on the dance for the Dec OFN. We are also looking forward to dancing to Lawrence Johnstone at the Rogues on Oct 20th (as well as round dancing to Mary!)
Securing guest callers/cuers might be a challenge - but it's been a lot of fun to see different faces up on stage and we are enjoying every dance to its fullest!!!
Our Nov 4th dance will feature Phil Ramey & Elaine Funk - this is our Mainstream/Plus dance with pre-rounds starting at 730pm.  Nov 18th is a "traveling dance" - we will be "dark" at the Charlie's hall - but that doesn't mean we won't be dancing. We are road tripping it up to Roseburg to enjoy a dance with Mike Sikorsky.  Promises to be a great time!!
We are very excited to be celebrating our 50th Birthday on Dec 2nd!!!! The fabulous Charlie Robertson will be calling & Steve Murphy will be cueing. This will be a wonderful celebration and we look forward to lots of visitors!!!!  Look for the flyers!!
Lots of exciting dances coming up and we are all looking forward to them.

Happy Dancing!
