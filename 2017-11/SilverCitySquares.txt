We had bad luck with our mainstream class this year, no students at any of our open classes. So we are going to try to have a plus class and see how that goes.
We had a good dance in October - Friday the 13th and Black Cat. Everyone who came enjoyed dancing to Leonard and Frances. Floyd cued for our September dance as Frances was visiting her mother.
Our November dance is also our Ham Dinner Dance. We are having a ham dinner available before the dance, so come enjoy some good food and stay for the dance.
Remember to get your teen festival pins from one of us youth as this is your entrance to the Teen Festival in May! They will cost more at the door then. See you at a dance soon. Petrina Buchheit
