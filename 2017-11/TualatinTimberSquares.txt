Tualatin Timber Squares is having a raffle contest for one free ribbon to MidWinter Festival.  Each paid dancer gets one free ticket into the drawing for every dance they attend.  Drawing will be held December 13th at our Ugly Christmas Sweater Dance.  Must be present to win.
 We will be holding a trophy dance at our Halloween dance October 25th.  The club with the highest percentage of members attending will win the trophy and get to host their own trophy dance.  Wear your costumes!  Weâ€™ll have prizes!
