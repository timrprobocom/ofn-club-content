We had our first fall Fifth Saturday Dance the end of September.  We had a number of our callers and cuers on hand to provide a FUN dance for all. 

Last June was the benefit dance for Wildlife Safari outside of Winston which is northwest of Roseburg.  It was a huge success after having a year's hiatus.  President, Linda Putzler will connect with the Buckeroos about how we can help with the benefit dance coming in June of 2018. 

One of our members, Janet Geiger, came back with her dad, Clarence, from Florida who was not well and unfortunately passed away on the 9th. hey had left one day prior to the big panic just before hurricane Irma. We keep Janet and family in our thoughts and prayers. Clarence was the brother of Joy Pitts (Single Trees) and Melba Walker. 

Another member, Kirby Goode, remains on 'in home' hospice care. It's been a long haul, but with the help and prayers of many friends he is hanging in there. We have a great caregiver, Jake Westra, who takes care of Kirby and Christina as well. Kirby has been on hospice care since November of 2016.

Our next scheduled dance date is December 31, New Year's Eve. Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli will call and cue.  We are still debating about format, callers, cuers, etc.  It'll be here before you know it though.
 
Keep em' dancing,
Christina Corelli, Secretary of CCCA
