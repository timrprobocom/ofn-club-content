Can you believe that there are Christmas decorations in the stores already?  We haven't even had our 2nd Annual Turkey Burn-off dance!  Heck, we haven't even had our Halloween dance.  But we did have some great dancing in September.  Our Back-to-school dance was great and all of the supplies we brought in went to Danny and Carol Williamson's daughter who teaches in a rural part of Yakima.  Carol said she was so very grateful to get them.  Our second dance in September was canceled because the hall was reserved for the cloggers from this area.
 By the time this is published we will have been dark so the club could enjoy time together dancing at the Seaside Sashay.  The club even bought pizza on Saturday night for all club members that were there.
 November starts with our Veteran's Day dance on the 11th.  Darrell Kalmbach will be calling and cues will be from Julie Stiers.  Then our Second Annual Turkey Burnoff with guest caller Dan Nordbye calling and Julie cueing again.
 Remember we dance plus from 7 to 8 and mainstream from 8 to 10 with round dancing intermixed with both.  The Hazel Dale Grange's wood floors make it easy on your feet.  The CRD prides itself in making sure all get to dance.  So, if you are a single you are always welcome.
 Did you know that on April 17, 1979, the square dance became the official Washington state dance?
