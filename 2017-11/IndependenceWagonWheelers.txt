The New IWW dance year is off to a great start. We kicked the year off by celebrating George Hermann’s birthday at our first dance, honoring our caller with cake and an avalanche of cards. 

September 3 found us at Maude Williams State Park for the annual IWW picnic – a huge success. Our September dances were well attended and lots of fun. Mainstream and Plus Lessons are well underway.  Come dance with us on the first and second  Saturdays at the Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall, and be sure to put our Veterans Day special dance on your calendar (Flyer in this issue of OFN).
