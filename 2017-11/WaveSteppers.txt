The Wave Steppers’ 2018 dance schedule is finalized.  The club’s St. Patrick’s Dance Saturday, March 10th, our first dance of the year, will feature club caller Joe Wrabek and line dance coach Gwen Kiel.  Joe and Gwen will also be doing the Mother’s Day Dance Saturday, May 12th, the County Fair Dance Saturday, August 11th, and the Fall Halloween Dance Saturday, October 13th.
 The Wave Steppers’ Spring Fling Dance Saturday, April 14th, will have caller Jeannine Alexander and round dance cuer Connie Clark.  June’s dance Saturday, June 9th, will once again be a Hawaiian Dance, with caller Mike Stout and cuer Julie Stout.  And the club’s Anniversary Dance in September (Saturday, September 8th) will again be an Elvis Dance, with caller (and Elvis impersonator) Mark Wheeler and cuer Connie Clark.
 All the above dances will be at Garibaldi City Hall (107 6th Street—at Acacia).  About two-thirds of the building’s second floor is a dance floor, built in the 1940s by the Fire Department for the old Firemen’s Balls.
 New for 2018 will be a BARN DANCE (we have a member with a barn, who has graciously offered it for the event); that will be Saturday, July 14th, with caller Darrell Kalmbach and cuer Connie Clark.  Jodie’s barn is just east of Tillamook, and we’ll be supplying directions.
 Square dance lessons taught by club caller Joe Wrabek continue on Wednesday nights at the Tillamook Elks Lodge, 1907 Third St. in downtown Tillamook, and are free.  (Joe also bakes cookies.)
