Our lessons began on Sunday September 10 with an energetic and enthusiastic group of new dancers and angels. They are progressing very well under the direction of their instructor Craig Abercrombie. 

Our club is still using guest callers for our dances . Our first dance in October is October 14 with Renee Ruud calling . Our second dance will be October 21 . This will be our Halloween dance. And promises a "howling good time." The caller for that evening will be Mark Wheeler.

We dance every second and third Saturday and love having company. In September we enjoyed having guests from Country Cut ups and B'N B . We usually have a club visitation every month to visit other clubs. We still have banners from Chaps and Petticoats, Sunset Promenaders and Hoedowners and extend a warm welcome to them and all clubs to come dance with us.  The more the merrier. 

See you in a square.
