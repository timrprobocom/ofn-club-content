Fall has officially arrived here in the Umpqua Valley. The leaves are turning bright colors and the air is crisp and cool. Another clue that fall is upon us is the beginning of a new cycle of mainstream classes here at the Buckeroo Barn. We currently have 43 students registered for our fall lessons. Mainstream classes are now closed, and we are helping prepare our students for their first “big dance” at Mid-Winter. We will begin a new class in February and hope that many of the current students will come out to angel and get even more floor time to practice.

Our dances this month were a lot of fun. Our first dance was a “Farewell to Summer” dance. We all had a great time getting back into the routine and enjoying the opportunity to dance without the high temperatures. Our second dance was a “Flower Power” dance with members dressing up like they just walked out of the 60’s and 70’s. It was great to see the creative costumes and remember the good old days of our youth! Both dances were called by Chuck Simpkins and cued by Neil Koozer.

We are gearing up for our annual wreath sale. This is our largest fundraiser of the year. Our members make beautiful wreaths to decorate your door over the holiday season. We are trying to be creative and add a few more opportunities to raise money to support the barn. In December, we will have our first ever Holiday Craft Bazaar on the 8th and 9th. There will be gift wrapping, visits with Santa, and concessions on hand during the event. Plan to come shop, or if you are a crafter, contact us to rent a table for only $20! All proceeds from fundraising helps pay our taxes, insurance, repairs, and general upkeep of the barn.

See you in a square,
