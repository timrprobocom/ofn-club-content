Fall is here with cooler temperatures, crisp days and nights. We are dancing our regular schedule of first and third Fridays of the month.
We visited the Willamette Squares for their Birthday Bash on October 29.  We have another visitation scheduled for November.  We are having a blast getting together and going to other clubs.
We have the first of the New Dancer Dances on November 26 at the Salem Square Dance Center on a Sunday afternoon. A flyer will be posted soon.
Mark your calendars for our New Year's Eve Dance to be held at St. Vincent's Church in Salem.  It will be an evening of Glitz & Glamour. Dress up and join us for a delicious dinner and then to dance the remainder of 2017 away.  New Dancer to Advanced Levels will be called. The cost will be $18.00 per dancer or $35.00 per couple.  See Lanie Rickard or Sheila Machado for tickets and further information.
As always, we look forward to seeing you on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
