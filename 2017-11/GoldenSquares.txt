After being Dark for the eclipse and Labor Day, it felt like forever since we danced. We finally started up again with a bang by having three dances in October with the fifth Monday being Pie Night. 

A few of us went to visit Salem Swinging Stars on their 5th Friday which was a lot of fun.  If you’re not busy on an odd Monday, don’t forget about visiting us. We have a lot of fun and a great dance floor. Happy Thanksgiving! Teija
