Fall is here with the usual on and off rain and sun.  I am happy to no longer be watering my plants.  Tomatoes are being shared by those good gardeners in our club.  Thank you for sharing your surplus. 
 The Labor Day dance at the Aloha Grange was super well attended and we had six squares all having a great time dancing to our caller and cuer, Daryl and Yvonne Clendenin. It was a happy holiday crowd enjoying dancing and seeing friends from other clubs who had the day off. 
 Cedar Hills Market shoppers saw how much fun they could have by square dancing.  On Saturday, September 9th seventeen members of the Eager Beavers and Hoedowners showed up to demonstrate and to recruit new dancers.  Our up-and-coming new caller, Lane Clem, called for the first time to sixteen members of the Eager Beaver and Hoedowner Clubs.  We were so good we had rounds of applause.  Thanks to all who volunteered and to Lane who did not look nervous at all. 
 We were in Seaside for our beach trip this year, October 4th - 6th, which is later than usual but Kay Rogers found a good place for us.  Everyone had a great time.  We lucked out with the weather; every day was sunny and warm.
 After a very successful Plus Class earlier this year we are repeating our program starting at noon, February 5th, Mondays, running into May.  If you are thinking about learning or brushing up on Plus be ready to join us.  We will have the same three great callers giving the lessons: Daryl Clendenin, Jim Hattrick, and Darrell Kalmbach.
We dance every Monday.  Please check for up to date information at www.eagerbeavers.info or OFN website: http://ofn.club.
