Tri Squares had a terrific anniversary dance on September 22nd and we'd like to thank everyone who came and made it so much fun!  We had six to seven squares on the floor all evening, with national caller Adam Christman and our cuer Sandra Pinion.  The plus dancers even filled four or more squares. And as a special treat, dancing with us were the presidents of the TVC, the PAC, and the Oregon Federation.  Pretty cool!
 Our B-51 lessons on Sundays from 3:30-5:30 will continue through November 26th.  And on Sunday October 8th we added a Mainstream Workshop at 2:00 which is open to all square dancers for $3 a visit.  So come spend a rainy Sunday afternoon with us at the Tigard Grange, and have some fun brushing-up at the Mainstream Workshop and later angeling students, too.
 In November we will be dark for our second dance, which is right after Thanksgiving.
