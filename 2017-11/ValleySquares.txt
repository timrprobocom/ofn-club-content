Please join us for our Tailgate Dance & hot dog dinner Saturday, November 4th. Scott Zinser is calling & Connie Clark cueing.   We also have our Thanksgiving Dance November 18th. 
 September was a month where our members danced at a variety of venues.  We weren't able to capture any flags because we were short of a square, but nonetheless you may have come across us at Wave Steppers' Elvis Dance, Toe Draggers' Anniversary Dance, or the Glenn & Sharon Driscoll benefit dance. 
 Our first Saturday Back to School dance called by Scott Zinser & cued by Connie Clark had six squares.  Thanks to all our guests & to everyone who donated school supplies.
