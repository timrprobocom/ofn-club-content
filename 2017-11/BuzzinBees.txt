Since I missed the deadline for the last issue I'm including our summer recap. We had a well-attended picnic in July at Bill and Linda Lundin's house followed by a good planning session for the upcoming year. We also had a fantastic camp out at Silver Springs campground in August. I found out just this weekend that the campground was not destroyed by the forest fire that was up in that area. 

Our new president, Frank Carter, presided over his first meeting. There are several changes coming to our format. We will be starting our dances at 7 p.m. with pre rounds and squares start at 7:30. We intend to dance until 9:30 and then have a break. We have two cuers coming this year. In November, Lonnie Sykes will start queuing for our third Saturday dance. In December , we welcome Dorothy Lowder back to the Bees. She will be our cuer for the first Saturday dance of the month. 

We started + lessons on October 8th. We are doing them at 4 p.m. and the cost is $5. The lessons are at the Hazel Dell Grange and they are before our regular lessons. We could always use angels to help out with the class.

We are very much looking forward to our dance scheduled for November 4th because we are doing a black light / Halloween dance. We did a black light dance several years ago and it was a blast. I encourage you to join us and be sure to wear some white. We will have white gloves for everyone at the dance.
