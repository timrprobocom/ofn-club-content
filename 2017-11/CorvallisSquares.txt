Our fall lessons are off to a good start, with capable instructors Bruce Lowther and Judy Russell. At the end of October, we're looking forward to our traditional Halloween Dance and will enjoy the festivities.

For November, our club is dark on the second Saturday in honor of Sweet Home Squarenaders' Turkey Dance. The fourth Saturday we are also dark due to the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. We'll be back in December with our Christmas dance on the second Saturday. Karen
