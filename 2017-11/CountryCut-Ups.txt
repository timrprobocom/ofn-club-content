October is a busy month for the Cut-Ups and we will be having the annual Ham, Egg and Pancake Breakfast which you dancers so wonderfully support. It hasn't happened yet as I am writing, but the preparations are underway. By the time this comes out, it will be over and we will be thankful for you participation. This might appear just before our 4th Saturday Spooky Black Light Dance with Scott Zinser.

November will see us dancing 1st and 4th Saturdays as usual. The Barn is a fun place to dance, so come join us. We have mainstream lessons going with Scott Zinser ever Thursday evening from 7:30 to 9:30 PM and can always use angels.

Looking ahead, we will be having a 5th Saturday dance in December on the 30th with Jim Hattrick. If you are leery of coming out on New Year's Eve, then join us on the Eve of New Year's Eve, for a fun dance. Details to follow. We will also be having another Murder Mystery Dance in March. This time it is an original composition. Let your curiosity drive you there!
