September was busy for our club with our first dance of the season and our square dance classes beginning on September 17.  We now have over 12 new dancers.
  
Our club dances on the first and third Saturday nights of the month. On Oct. 21 we have our Black Light Dance, which is always a lot of fun.  Our caller is Charlotte Jeskey and our cuer is Jackie Gale. During October, being a part of the Alliance, we participate in the Timber Twirlers "Talk Like A Pirate" Dance and the Corvallis Squares Halloween Dance. These dances give our club the opportunity to enjoy dancing with our friends across the Valley. Look forward to seeing you in a square. Marilyn York
