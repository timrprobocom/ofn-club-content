The Rogue Squares classes are going great with Phil Ramey (Phil-Billy) teaching. We have 5 students on a regular basis and a couple who live in Alaska and come to the classes for 2 weeks at a time and then are back in Alaska for 2 weeks. The people who are attending, are having a great time.

The "Angel Cards" are a huge success. We have several Angels who attend both the Rogue Squares and the Star Promenaders classes, so they already have full cards and will be able to attend any regular club dance of either club for free. Good going guys, and thank you.

The Rogue Squares dance for November is on November 17, with Richard Lane from the Portland area calling. He is a great caller and we will all have a wonderful time dancing to him. Don't forget there will be Advanced from 6:30 to 7:30, pre rounds with Elaine Funk from 7:30 to 8:00 and Mainstream with every third tip Plus from 8-10pm. Come on out and have a great time and salute our Veterans.

The Rogue Squares are cooking up something for the New Year. Stay tuned to this station for further developments.

See you in a square!!!!
