The intermediate level Waltz lessons continue with several students who carried over from the summer lessons. We also have some new students to our class who have moved up from Phase 2 Waltz so this makes a nice class for all. Those of us who already dance that level are re-learning some specific particulars to the movements. Stance, frame, direction, and positions are all being corrected, slightly adjusted, or renewed in case we had forgotten something in relation to a certain step.

We have a New Yearâ€™s Eve dance coming up. We hope you will put our dance on your calendar and join us for a relaxing evening of dancing, food, and friendship.

There will be no Showcase for our club this upcoming Mid-Winter. It is time to take a rest, get the students up to par and get them interested in doing a Showcase in 2019. 

We dance on Thursdays from 6:30-9:30 p.m. at the Salem Square Dance Center. You are welcome to join us any time. Marilyn Schmit
