The turnout for the MWA Fall Festival was disappointing. Two squares danced while maybe two more squares were on the sidelines. We realize there were also several other events happening that evening so guess it was to be expected. We still had lots of fun with Leonard Snodgrass and Bruce Lowther calling and Sandra Pinion, Judy Russell and Stephanie Lozano cuing. Thank you to all who attended.
