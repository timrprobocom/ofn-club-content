With the help of all our dancing friends we are holding our own and providing some fun activities in our area. Our September dances and the one visitation to Salem Swingin’ Stars went very well. A small but enthusiastic group of us carpooled up the I-5 corridor to visit Salem Swingin’ Stars’ Corn N Cluck dance, and we sure had a lot of fun dancing to Randy Dibble’s calling and Ken Pratt’s cueing.  We missed Jeanine Norden who we hope will recover soon.  We brought back a banner and encourage them to come get it back!
 
Jim Hattrick, who calls our first dance of the month, always does a fantastic job of mixing things up and keeping us on our toes, reviewing the basics in an innovative way so we don’t get bored, but improve our skill level. Jackie Gale, our club cuer, always cues her best and gets more and more people out on the round dance floor.  

Our fourth Friday dance was called once again this year by Craig Abercrombie and his Texas friend, Al Frazier. We kept the Sock Hop theme going so there were lots of poodle skirts and pedal-pushers and white shirts on the floor. We added to the entertainment by having people bring in photos of themselves in their younger years and having people guess who was in the photo.  This proved to be a big hit.

Altogether it was a really great month to welcome in the new dance year. We are looking forward to our November dances and hope to see more of our dancing friends join us.  I am also hoping by the time this goes to publication that our president Larry Reetz, who had gall bladder surgery Sept. 25., is recovering quickly. I want to thank him for being so supportive of the visitations!

The combined lessons that started Sept. 26 are going well.  More angels to help out the newbies would be appreciated whether from our local clubs or visitors from other areas. We need new dancers to keep the Emerald Empire area going.
