There’s been a lot spoken about Fake News as of late.  As a public service, we will try to keep you informed about potential fake news.  If you hear stories such as:

(1)	The B&B’s don’t have the prettiest girls in the council
(2)	Or the burliest of guys
(3)	Or the very best snack food
(4)	Or the best callers and cuers around
(5)	Or we’re too cheap to pay a class caller
(6)	Or that we don’t have the very smartest class
(7)	Or that Lotta Fluff doesn’t exist

You can believe it is FAKE NEWS.  Come on out any Wednesday night and check us out.

Lotta (Carlotta) Fluff
