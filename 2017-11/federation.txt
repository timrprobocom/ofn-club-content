<h3>Publicity and Education</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">If you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to register for Mid-Winter (<a href="http://www.midwinterfestival.com/">www.midwinterfestival.com</a>) in Albany January 26-28, please consider taking a few moments to do so.&nbsp; They always put on a great program with outstanding callers and cuers.&nbsp; If you are an experienced dancer, invite your new dancers to attend the weekend with you.&nbsp; Sometimes all it takes is a simple invitation, and then you&rsquo;ll wonder why you hesitated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; mso-pagination: none;">Our Education Seminar during Mid-Winter this year will be &ldquo;Looking for Fun in All the Right Places&rdquo;.&nbsp; Remember when we attended a festival or a special dance and we came away with fun memories that have stuck with us through the years?&nbsp; We may not remember which festival or dance, but we remember the Outhouse Race, the Suitcase Race, the time when the delegates whose council&rsquo;s had the lowest attendance at Summer Festival had to eat cow pies (really brownies) during Summer Festival, the dunk tank, and &hellip; I could go on and on. Well, that is what this Round Table Discussion led by Dave Cooper and friends is all about.&nbsp; We will be looking for ideas on how we can work together to help make dances more fun so that our enthusiasm bubbles over and makes other people wonder what we are up to and decide they want to join in, too.&nbsp; The Round Table Discussion will be Saturday, January 27, 2018, in the Oregon State Room from 2-3:00 pm.&nbsp; Bring your ideas and share them. The ideas generated will be included in the March OFN.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Summer Festival 2018 will be in the beautiful Rogue Valley in Grants Pass, June 22-24, 2018. They are busy planning an entire weekend full of dancing and other activities that are popular throughout their area.&nbsp; They currently only have 20 people registered, so I invite you to hurry up and pre-register so that they can continue planning their fun activities.&nbsp; In addition to a great dance program, they will have tours, dances in special locations, youth activities, and a lot more.&nbsp; Plan your summer vacation around this weekend and stay awhile.
