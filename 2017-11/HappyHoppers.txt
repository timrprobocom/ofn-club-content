Now that fall is officially upon us, everything we eat comes in a Pumpkin Spice flavor option. Not sure I'll try the Pumpkin Spice hot dogs, but someone will! Our lessons have made a complete circuit now and things are running smoothly. We start over the first Monday of every month with beginner, mainstream and plus. Shout of thanks to Nick Johnson who stepped up to be our second Evergreen Council Rep. We are still looking for another rep to the PAC. Our new webpage is up & running albeit with a few kinks here & there. Take some time to check it out www.Happy-hoppers.com and view the new article from Clark County Today featuring the Happy Hoppers and our wonderful caller, Jim Hattrick. We are so fortunate to have Jim and all the members that make our club so vibrant. November 4th we will be DARK for the annual Royal Romp. If you're up for a fun & challenging Plus weekend, you'll want to get signed up for this one. November 18th is our Pies & Presents dance. If you'd like to donate toys we'll be accepting them at this dance and also at our dance Dec 2nd. And of course our fabulous New Year's Eve dance featuring the Front Porch Trio will be coming up fast. We will introduce our theme soon and tickets will available to purchase. Mark your calendars for all the dances coming and I hope to see you across a square soon! Remember, we start earlier now, 7PM Pre-rounds and 7:30-9:45 Plus!
