Timber Twirlers is in full swing for our new dance season. By the time you read this, we will have had our annual "Talk Like A Pirate Dance" always one of the highlights of our dance year. 
We have a small new dancerâ€™s class but they are having a lot of fun with our caller/instructor Bruce Lowther. Judy Russell makes up our flyers and posts them in the OFN and on Facebook every month so look for them to keep up with all the fun themes we have. See you in a square. Sandy
