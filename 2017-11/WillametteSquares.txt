Willamette Squares held their very own Oktoberfest! Gary Ohren in his lederhosen and Sandy Harris in her German attire brought some German flavor to the dance floor. Sandy called various German songs but more especially special music called the Lederhosen Polka that she ordered just for this dance. Food consisted of rye rolls, Oktoberfest sausage, sauerkraut, and as many mustards as you might want. Those of us who attended had a great time! The mood was lively and the dancing matched the mood. 
We have a good start on lessons. We can always use angels if you are so inclined. We are looking forward to our birthday dance/Halloween dance. Costumes are enjoyed but not required. Jodee Howard
