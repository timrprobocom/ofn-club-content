We were pleased to be dancing again to Kris Jensen, a national caller from Albuquerque. The Women's Retreat was the same weekend. A number of our club's women got to go and have a great time dancing, eating, etc.  

Kris Jensen had done a demo at Sheldon Oaks where her mom and Kurt's mom lives. Two residents showed up to dance with us at the hall. Tim made sure they could dance during the evening and learn moves. They had danced previously and took to it like ducks to water. We are getting more guests showing up to have a FUN time with us.

We dance almost every Sunday at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.  5:30 - 8:00 p.m., all levels.  Come join us.  It's FUN!  Please go to our "When and Where" page to make sure we are dancing. This is always kept up to date.  Thanks!
 
Happy Dancing,
Christina Corelli, Member-at-Large
