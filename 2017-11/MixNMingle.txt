With summer over, we should make it through the next months without having to go dark because of the heat.  Because of Royal Romp, it's time to remind everyone that we will be dark November 4th.  We will be back with all the lights on November 18th.  We look forward to dancing with our long time and newer friends once again.
 This month the news from Jeanine is that she needs more healing time before she is able to return to cueing.  We all wish her a speedy recovery and hope to see her back on our stage as soon as she's ready.
 In the meantime, stock up on food for our canned food dance December 16th.  Now is the time to check for sales of nourishing and tasty nonperishable goods.  We have a place for it if you bring it early, too.
