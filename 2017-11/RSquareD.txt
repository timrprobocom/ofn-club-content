September we returned to our 2nd Friday, fourth Saturday dancing schedule.  The 2nd Friday dance was a crazy t-shirt dance.
 Our annual camp out was held at Vista park in Skamokawa WA.  Members enjoyed camping in their RV's and yurts.   What a fantastic weekend.  The weather was perfect, the company was excellent, the bon fire was hot, and the food was delicious (as always). 
 On the 23rd we did a demo dance at a local assisted living home.  Seven couples attended to entertain the residents.  The residents particularly enjoyed watching their activities director participate in a square.  Later that evening was our regular 4th Saturday dance.   We danced to the calling of Craig Abercrombie and Al Frazier with cueing of Lonnie Sycks.
 In November we will dance on the 10th and 25th.  On the 10th we will be honoring our veterans with free admittance to the dance.  The 25th is a Gospel dance, come and dance away your Thanksgiving dinner.
