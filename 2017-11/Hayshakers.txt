If you are reading this in mid October, you still have time to join us at the Seaside Sashay, October 27th and 28th, in Seaside Oregon.  The dance features Dan Preedy and Darrell Kalmbach calling with Debbie Taylor cueing.  A fun and eventful weekend with dancing on the turnaround, weather permitting.  Also, do not forget the mud wrestling competition!
