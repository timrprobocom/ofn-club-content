Cherry City Cloggers have wrapped up the demo season and are now into our Fall beginner class. We have about 8 attending. Not a real big class but they are enthusiastic about learning to clog and doing a great job. We have some in the class who are going through a second time to refine what they learned last year.  

Several of our members attended the Northwest Clogging Workshop in Vancouver the end of September and had a wonderful time. We are still searching for someone who would be interested in instructing classes. At the present time our more advanced members are doing a great job at keeping the club going, reviewing some old favorites, and teaching new ones as well. Georganne Pfnister
