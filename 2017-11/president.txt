<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Many of our clubs will be holding dances this month celebrating autumn.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to encourage all of you to visit at least one other club this month, either on your own or as part of an&nbsp;official visitations with your club, a neighboring club, or your council.&nbsp; All of our clubs are struggling to retain members and remain financially solvent and we need to work together to help each other. One of the best ways to do that is to visit another club and encourage the dancers from your club to go with you.&nbsp; In the TVC about 4 years ago, we started encouraging clubs to visit all of the anniversary dances.&nbsp; It was a slow start, but people started to respond.&nbsp; Last year, promoting the anniversary visitations using social media, email, published schedules, and encouragement, the visitations really took off.&nbsp; Delegates encouraged their club members to go along on the visitation.&nbsp; After the first anniversary dance, clubs started really participating and the hosting clubs had from 10 to 13 squares at each of their anniversary dances.&nbsp; This year (September-August) the attendance has been even better, with clubs reporting attendance from 89 to 111 dancers!&nbsp; These numbers are thanks to the clubs in the council supporting each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; The PAC will be setting up their own visitation schedule for all of their clubs&rsquo; anniversary dances in the near future, and I am looking forward to hearing about their success. If other councils or clubs are initiating a regular visitation schedule, I&rsquo;d like to hear about those, too.&nbsp; Well-attended visitations may make a difference on whether or not a club continues to exist.&nbsp; Remember to let the club you are visiting know that you are coming if you are bringing a group with you.&nbsp; If you are visiting a small club, consider bringing items to share during their break.&nbsp; Remember, visitations being return visits, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;is a definite win-win!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Several of your OFSRDC Board members are interested in starting an official visitation schedule where we can come and visit your area for your council dances or special area dances.&nbsp; During this month, please send me information on your area&rsquo;s special or council dances so that I can make and publish an OFSRDC Visitation Schedule.&nbsp; I hope to attend at least one special dance in all of our councils sometime during the next year and a half.</p>
