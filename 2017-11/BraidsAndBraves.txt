We really enjoyed our first dance in our new venue, the Palmer Creek Lodge! The wooden dance floor is lovely and there are lots of seats along the walls! There's also a gathering area with chairs and a table outside the entrance door where the elevator comes up. It has a nice kitchen and dining area downstairs as well. Bruce Lowther and Judy Russell visited to help make our evening even more fun. We hope to see more visitors in the coming months. 

We also enjoyed the Mid-Willamette Area Fall Festival at the Salem Square Dance Center. There were two squares on the floor, lots of round dancers and nearly two more squares visiting on the side lines. Our great caller, Leonard Snodgrass emceed and Bruce Lowther also called several tips. Sandra Pinion cued as well as Judy Russell and Stephanie Lozano. Happy Fall, everyone! Carmen
