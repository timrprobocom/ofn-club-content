I so welcome Fall, rain and all.  Our Anniversary dance was a complete success.  So much fun with 116 dancers.  Thanks everyone for coming out to support us and dance to the Wildcards.  The next night was the State Dance with our own Kathy Roberts getting installed as the new State Federation President.  She is a busy girl and we thank her for her dedication to square dancing.  A week later was our Dance for the Cure.  We still are counting the donations to see if we beat last year’s amount.  The square dance community is a wonderful support group.  We thank everyone for coming and supporting our friends with cancer.
 Visitations kept us busy dancing with our Newberg and Tri Square friends.  We enjoyed the TVC dance where the Wildcards called their last dance together.  We wish you all well.
 We hope you’ll all come out to the Kinton Grange Fall Feast on Oct. 29th from noon to 4 p.m.  Dinner in or take outs.  This is our biggest money maker for the year for our grange.  www.kintongrange.org for details.
 The Toes are looking into a winter retreat this winter.  It’s a time of relaxing together as a club and just enjoying time off with one another.
 November is our dance month where we are collecting canned food.  Bring your donations and dance with us November 3rd for the Boot Scootin Boogie Dance with your western outfits and spirited dance moves.  November 17th is our Thankful Dance and November 26th we decorate the hall for Christmas and go out to dinner when we are done.  Oh how the Toes love to eat together, visit and just enjoy one another’s company.
 The holidays are fun to get ready for and we continue on with our food drive so hope you will continue to help us feed the folks in need during this holiday season.  See you in a square.
