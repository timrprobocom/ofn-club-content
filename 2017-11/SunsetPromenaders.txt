Unfortunately the Annual Hahn Barn Dance was canceled because of 97⁰F heat and Eagle Creek wildfire smoke and ash.
 We have been busy lately doing several visitations, including Valley Squares, Toe Draggers, Tri-Squares, and Hoedowners.  The Club did a “demo dance” at the “Blooming Junction Nursery” near Cornelius, and it was fun even though it was outdoors and dancing on gravel.
 Thirty Seven dancers went to our beach campout this year at Devils Lake RV Campground in Lincoln City; we socialized, put prizes together, square and round danced, went out to eat, and stayed in and had a potluck taco-bar.
