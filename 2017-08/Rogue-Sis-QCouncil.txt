Well, summer is finally here. BIG TIME!!  We must remember these sunny days this winter when it is raining and the snow is falling and everyone wishes for more sunshine. We are in a place where there are 4 seasons. Thank GOD.

The Council's "Fountain of Youth Dance" was a success. Chuck Simpkins did his usual job of keeping the dancers having a great time. We had a nice treat — Rikki Lobato was on hand to cue rounds for us. Great Job — Both of You.

The Council Dance on September 30 will be in Grants Pass at the Fruitdale Grange — see the flyer for the address. The dance will be called by Scott Zinser and cued by Elaine Funk. Come on out and join us in a lot of fun and good dancing. This dance will be good for your newer dancers.

Don't forget to support the Council and the Clubs in the Rogue Valley.

The next Council meeting will be August 7, 2017 at Denny's Restaurant on Biddle Road at 4:30pm.

There are still "Learn to Square Dance" t-shirts available. I have quite a few 2X's. We have found the t-shirts are a great conversation starter.
