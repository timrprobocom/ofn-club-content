We are now in the middle of the lazy days of summer and I hope everyone is enjoying the beautiful sunshine. 

If you want to dance in an air conditioned hall, come join us every Friday between 11:00am-2:00pm. Lunch after the dance. 

It was an honor to be able to celebrate our 100 year old member, Dell Uptegrove's, birthday in June. Hope to see you in a square soon.
