Our club is dark for July and August, but we're happy to see there are a variety of dances up and down the valley, including Summer Festival in Salem where we can dance.

We enjoyed a club potluck in June and have another one planned for August. Then we are looking forward to our fall lessons. We've found that most new dancers have been personally invited by a club member, so we're focusing on that approach and also making business sized cards with lessons information to hand out. We also hope once again to dance a demo at the Corvallis Farmers' Market.

We hope you're enjoying summer in Oregon; some say nothing else can compare! Karen Karplus
