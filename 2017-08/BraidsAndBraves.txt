Braids and Braves are dark for July and August. Hope you enjoyed the Summer Festival. 

When the new dance season begins in September, we'll have a new location for our dances: Palmer Creek Lodge in Dayton. It has wood floors and an elevator. We will still have our dances on the third Saturday of the month beginning September 16 with Leonard Snodgrass calling and Sandra Pinion cueing. A flyer will be coming out soon with directions to the new location.  

We are trying something new for our new dancer lessons this year. They will be on Sunday evening beginning September 8 from 6:00 â€“ 8:30 p.m. They will again be held at the Yamhill Valley Heritage Farm Museum. Carmen
