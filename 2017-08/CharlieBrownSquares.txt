The Charlie’s will be dark thru August for the County Fair. On Tuesday, September 5th we will be having a Dust The Rust Off workshop to help our Angels get ready for new classes starting the following week on September 12th.  Chuck Simpkins will be teaching our new beginner’s class starting in September. We are actively recruiting new dancers, so we hope to get a good size class and plenty of Angels to help out!!  We will not be having any club dances until Oct 7th. We are dark for both Labor Day and Circle N Squares birthday dance in September.  Since we no longer have a club caller, we are going to be contracting guest callers for our dances on the 1st & 3rd Saturdays of each month. We will have Michael Kious & Rikki Lobato calling & cueing our first dance back on Oct 7th & on Oct 21st we will have Scot & Erin Byars as our guests!!!  Keep an eye out for our other guest callers – we’ve got a good lineup started and are very excited about who will be visiting Grants Pass!!!!
 
We only had 1 dance during the month of July – it was a small dance, but it was Ray Holmes’s last official dance for us and those that were able to make it wished him well!! The Charlie’s would like to wish Ray the best on his new adventure and extend our thanks for his last 2 years of calling and teaching for the Charlie Brown Squares!! 
 
We hope to see everyone in a square soon. Lots of our club members travel, so although we are “dark” for a couple months – we are still around!!  We will be celebrating our 50th birthday on Dec 2nd and have a wonderful guest caller Charlie Robertson from the LA area as well as cuer Steve Murphy from Klamath Falls. Mark your calendars now!!
 
Happy Dancing!!
