Thomas' lessons are progressing. He has varied between no students one week to up to 8 another week. It seems to be a little "hit or miss" on attendance due to summer activities for families.

We are planning on dancing in the Homer Davenport Parade in Silverton on Saturday August 5. 

We are starting planning for coming back to dancing in September. See you then if not before!  Petrina Buchheit
