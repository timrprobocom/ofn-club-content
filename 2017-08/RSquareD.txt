A memorial luncheon was held at the Canterbury Inn for long time member of R square D club, Joyce Cole.  She was 92.  Her husband, Harley Cole, had been a long time caller for the club.  Several square dancers that attended shared many fond memories of her.  Joyce was a very active member of the club until the recent years, she was know for her silliness, giggles, her bag lady antics along with her “Kool aide” jug for special events at our club.  Her favorite ribbon was using toilet paper for decorating new RV's and also dressing up callers.  She will be missed by all of us.
 We had three squares for our strawberry dance at our Wednesday night dance; it was also a celebration for our high school graduate, Kindra Hammers.
 Dick and Sandy Sims represented our club at the state festival in Spokane; they spent several days taking in all the activities.
 Our Monthly meeting was held at Ron and Lynn Waleizers back yard, a short meeting in a beautiful evening setting.
 June 28th, Wednesday night dance was “take me out to the ball game” theme with Polish sausage served at break. Our caller, Craig, being a baseball fan was pleased with the theme and kept 4 squares moving on the floor.
 August 9th will be our Hawaiian Dance, remember to dress casually.  And, on the 23rd we have our Back to School dance, also casual.  Please bring school supplies for those less fortunate in our community.  Come dance with us.
