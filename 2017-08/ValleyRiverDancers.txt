Our DBD Plus Lessons are going well and everyone is having a good time.  We went dark for Summer Festival, which most of our club members attended and had a great time. 
It’s not too late to plan to come and dance with us on July 28 for our “Dance Under the Stars”.  It is always a fun dance and you can come early and enjoy the food and festivities of Newberg’s Old Fashioned Festival. Hope to see you in a square soon. Jan Amerson
