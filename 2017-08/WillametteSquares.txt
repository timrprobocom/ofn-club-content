Willamette Squares is thankful that its members are currently free from health issues which have not been the case in the past. Our president, John Templin, is back from a seventeen day trip to Cincinnati. He drove with his ninety-six year old mother to Baltimore and Washington D.C. and enjoyed visits with family. 
If you attended our most recent square dance, you would have seen dancers sporting favorite baseball caps. The theme was America's greatest pastime of baseball, and what would be a baseball game without crackerjacks! An assortment of balls decorated the tables, and of course, there were plenty of other snacks besides crackerjacks to satisfy our palates. The dancing was lively and fun, the result of a team effort. In baseball terms you might say our dance scored a home run!
Willamette Squares is looking forward to the summer festival where when we aren't filling various volunteer jobs, we will be dancing up a storm, enjoying watching other dancers, and connecting with friends! We are also preparing for square and round dance lessons in the fall.  Jodee Howard
