We have been using guest callers since Les Seeley moved to Arizona. Each of these callers are candidates for the position of permanent club caller. They are doing an outstanding job of calling and we have been enjoying dancing with each of them. We hope to make our selection of a club caller by  November. From what I have seen of the candidates we can not help but end up with a wonderful caller . We love them all !! 

Our club is going dark July 15 for our club visitation to summer festival . August 12 Les Seeley  will be back to call a dance for us , and August 19 our guest caller will be Darrell Kalmbach. 

We have been having club visitations to other clubs each month and have a nice collection of banners from other clubs. We have banners from Tumbleweeds, Chaps and Petticoats, Valley Squares, R Square D, and Hoedowners as well as Charlie Brown. We dance all summer  and welcome all dancers. We love having company so come dance with us .
