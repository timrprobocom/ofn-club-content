What a busy month here at the Buckeroo Barn! We have been visiting clubs up and down I5. This has been fun for our members and given our new dancers plenty of floor time to practice their new dancing skills. We had 23 members who went to visit Spin Cycle Squares in Springfield. We all had a blast! It was fun to practice dancing from both positions.

We also had 10 members who went to Medford’s Fountain of Youth Dance. 
Everyone had a great time and enjoyed meeting up with friends from other clubs. In addition to visitations, we continue to offer “FunShops” on Monday nights to provide more floor time for our members and new dancers.

We are doing a demo for “Relay for Life” on July 22 at 1:30 am. Yes, am!!! We are also joining the Charlie Brown Squares to celebrate at the Canyonville Parade. We are gearing up for another summer tradition…the Douglas County Fair . We will dance August 9-12, from 7 to 9 pm. The Umpqua Area Council sponsors this dance each year. We have a great wooden dance floor that we use, and we are easy to find since we are located by the main entrance. Check out the UAC flyer and join us. In order to dance at the fair you do need to wear square dance attire!

The Buckeroos welcomed new president Bruce Knotts on July 1st.  Bruce has danced for more than 40 years. He dances both the mainstream and plus programs, and  he is looking forward to helping the Buckeroos grow. 

Here at the Barn, we dance all summer long. The barn is air conditioned, and we are just a short drive south from the Portland area, so plan to join us in the near future. We dance the first and third Saturdays and always enjoy having visitors. We have members of all ages and are a family friendly club.

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
