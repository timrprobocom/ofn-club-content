There’s a sign in the Boring Barn about three types of people (1) Those that make things happen (2) Those that watch things happen and (3) Those that wonder what happened.  I confess I usually fall into the last category.

On the other end of our council (from the Barn) is the Silver Stars.  Here is a club that at one time was so big it even had its own weekend dance festival as a fund raiser.  Eventually, over a period of time, the festival went away, the door prize tickets went away, the food went away and the dance nights went away.  Now they will only dance once a year.  According to the Federation, they have 19 members.  What happened?  I don’t know.

Contrast this with the Tumbleweeds, in the middle of our council.  They also have 19 members, dance each week and have one of the finest weekly lunches you’ll find anywhere.  What’s the difference?  I don’t know.  What happened?  I don’t know.  Maybe you can let me know at semichasse@gmail.com

One thing for sure: it is good there is a council so that ideas can be shared on what works and what doesn’t.  We can all learn new things.
