<h3>Federation Meeting</h3>
<p>The Federation held its quarterly meeting at Summer Festival on July 16. &nbsp;This was a spirited meeting, with lots of things happening. &nbsp;There was a good discussion about our background check procedures, although there is more to be said. &nbsp;We do not have a Summer Festival scheduled beyond 2018, and it is getting harder to find councils willing to put one on. &nbsp;The Emerald Empire is also finding it hard to find chairmen and volunteers for Mid-Winter.</p>
<p>A parliamentary board meeting is not a good place for round-table discussions. &nbsp;A suggestion was made that we create a web forum or bulletin board system on the Federation's web page to enable rousing discussions. &nbsp;That is likely to happen very shortly. &nbsp;Watch here for more information.</p>
<p>The next Federation meeting will be September 17 at the Kinton Graonge in Beaverton, where we will install our new officers.</p>
