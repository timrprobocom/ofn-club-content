    Late June we had a couple of hot Sunday nights as the air conditioner went down.  Apparently, a squirrel had touched a live wire which took out the air conditioning in Hall A.  Nonetheless, we had a super group of dancers from the Buckeroos of Roseburg come down to dance with us.  Twenty-three dancers!  Wow!  Laura and Bruce Knotts had made the arrangements.  This was their anniversary celebration.  Chuck Simpkins, their caller, told Bruce and Laura he and Carla would come up to Springfield if they got at least 16 dancers to commit to come up.  There were 23 total.  Needless to say, Chuck and Carla came too, and it was so good to see them.  Chuck called a tip for us.  We are looking for a time for us to visit them down in Roseburg. 
 
    In July, Wendy and Alex came to talk to us about square dancing and take some photos of us having the time of our lives.  Wendy works for the Eugene Weekly magazine.  We look forward to seeing  the article and photos.  Tim Matteson, our caller, got Wendy and Alex out for a tip of beginning square dancing.   With all of those angels, Alex and Wendy did well and had a great time.  FUN for sure..  A seed was planted! 
 
    We are so grateful for the Emerald Dance Center where there is air conditioning, a cushioned wood floor, built in speakers, a closet, a cupboard and a great kitchen.  We've been here a few years now and appreciate all of the work people do for this wonderful venue. 
 
Happy dancing!
