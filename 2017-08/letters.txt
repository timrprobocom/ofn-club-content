<li><a>River City Riders -- Thank You</a>
<div>
<p style="clear: right;"><a href="content/2017-08/t300/2017-RCD-Thanks.jpg"><img class="right" src="content/2017-08/t150/2017-RCD-Thanks.png" /></a></p>
<p>The River City Riders rode into the 66th National Square Dance Convention in Cincinnati, OH, and put their action into the hearts of 3,600 dancers. &nbsp;"Mr. Ed" and his herd put on 6 perfect performances, providing joy to all. &nbsp;Not only did they do this, but also danced with and helped earn the Guinness Record for largest square dance, with over 1,600 dancers.</p>
<p>The Riders that put forth their right foot were Jolene &amp; Ed Cumming as lead horses, Lois Manos, Gil Shoemaker, Carol &amp; Danny Williamson, Norma Rice, Dale Smith &amp; Anna Easton. &nbsp;Anna was the new horse in the paddock and made the single-foot look easy. &nbsp;Our stampede was just plain awesome! &nbsp;Our caller, Jim Hattrick, put together a new 4-couple program to "Long Tall Texan" with A1 moves that flowed like a race track.</p>
<p>As we performed, dancers came to us wanting pictures and congratulating us for the great performances! &nbsp;As for the future, 2018 Kansas City is ready for us, 2019 Atlantic City wants and will help raise funds, and 2020 Spokane is a close one! &nbsp;The head of Exhibitions, Nancy Hendrickson &amp; Ken Roberts, set us up with action that we all enjoyed and a spacious room with water and snacks. &nbsp;Nancy met us out on the street as we circled the Duke Energy Convention Center, and took us to unload and transport the horses. &nbsp;Thank you Nancy &amp; Ken for a job well done.</p>
<p>A successful story is always due to those that help, and we, the River City Riders, want to acknowledge as many as we can over the past year. &nbsp;Making our trip to the National Convention&nbsp;was possible because of meny helping hands. &nbsp;</p>
