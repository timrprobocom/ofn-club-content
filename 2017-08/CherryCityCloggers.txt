The club is still going strong, although as you probably already know, our beloved instructor of many years, Cheri Posedale, resigned in the Spring. There was some concern as to whether the club would be able to continue and if so what that would look like. Since that time, some of our long time members have rallied to the challenge and began to learn to cue and teach. While they may not have totally perfected the art yet, they are doing a great job and our club has remained strong. We had our annual summer meeting on July 16 and decisions will soon be made as to the future.  At this point, we are still planning on offering beginner lessons September through December at the Square Dance Center. 

We are now in our demo season and have danced at World Beat, the Marion County Fair, at the Bush Barn Art Fair in July and also the Silverton Art Fair in August. Georganne Phnister
