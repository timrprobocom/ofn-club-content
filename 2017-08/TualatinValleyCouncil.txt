Since the OFN is published mid month, you still have time to plan on attending the TVC 5th Saturday “Round Dance Party” on July 29th at the IOOF Hall, 267 E Main St. Hillsboro, OR 97123.  Ken Pratt will be the Cuer MC.  Round dancers will enjoy Phase II through VI cueing.  Cuers from the floor will be welcomed to participate, time permitting.  The dance begins at 7:30 and continues until 10:00 PM.  For additional information please contact Kathy Roberts, (503) 590-4187, kathy@4roberts.us.
 Our next Council event will be our annual Hahn Farm Potluck and Dance on Sunday, August 27th.  Potluck by the lake begins at 5:30 followed by dancing in the barn from 6:30 to 9:30 PM.  This year our caller is Janienne Alexander with Mark McDonald from Central OR cueing.  In case of high temperatures, we will still hold the dance unless it is over 90 degrees that day, then check the Oregon Federation Facebook or the TVC website for our decision on whether or not we will hold the dance.  Last year, it was about 85 degrees when we started the picnic.  We kept cool at the pond where there was a nice cool breeze and everyone was comfortable.  By the time we went to the barn to dance, the temperature had dropped lower and it was quite pleasant.
