First I must make a correction to last month's report.  Our members Wallace & Roberta Prowell celebrated their 67th anniversary in June, not their 50th.  They were married in 1950.  Congratulations again!
 Because our club is going dark in July and August, it was upsetting that the weather report for our last dance in June was in the 90's, indicating we should cancel the dance.  But instead we tried something new and moved our dance to the downstairs break area in the grange.  It worked great, with our visiting caller Scott Zinser, and we had a "Berry Sundae" good time.
 However our mystery trip for the next day (100 degrees) was postponed.  To keep dancing over the summer we are visiting four clubs with air conditioning and encouraging our members to attend the Summer Festival and the TVC dances, too.  Should be fun!
