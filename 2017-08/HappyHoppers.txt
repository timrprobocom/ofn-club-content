Happy Hoppers may be dark for the summer but we have lots going on!
At the PAC Dance Fri June 29th, we had several members in attendance and even won the drawing for stealing the PAC banner. You can look for it hanging at our September dances until we return it to the Tri-Council dance Sept 30.

The next night, July 1st, we had a joint visitation with the Columbia River Dancers to the Country Cut-Ups at the Boring Barn for their Picnic BBQ. I’ve lost count of how many of us were there but it was at least 2 squares. And we brought back on of our banners. This club visitation thing is sure fun!

 We are looking forward to our Annual Club BBQ Picnic on August 6th.  We get to see old friends and make some new ones while enjoying yummy food and fellowship.

Our new dance format this fall will kick off on Sept 2nd. We will dance our Pre-rounds from 7-7:30 and dance Plus from 8-9:45. Then we’ll do refreshments and announcements. Be sure to come join us as we swing back into dance season. We welcome visitors at all our dances and hope to see YOU there!
