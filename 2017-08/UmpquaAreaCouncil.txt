This is a last minute reminder that we will be dancing at the “Douglas County Fair” 7:00 – 9:00 pm during Fair Week. We would love to have out of town dancers join us dancing.  Please check out our flyer for more information.   Our fabulous line up of Callers is:
August 9th, Wednesday, Scott Zinser   
August 10th, Thursday, Chuck Simpkins,  
August 11th, Friday, Dale Roberson 
August 12th, Saturday, Chuck Simpkins.
Neil Koozer will be Cueing each evening. 
The Douglas County Fair is always a fun place to dance and because we are located at the front gate we are easy to find.  Just listen for the sounds of a Caller or Cuer, and look for the swish of
petticoats and square dance skirts and you will find us.   
Hope to see you at the Fair!
