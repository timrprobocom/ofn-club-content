As I write this, the weather forecasts are for two days of upper 90s, although those aren't our dance nights.  We hope for more moderate temperatures for our summer dances, weather suitable for our root beer float and watermelon dances.  The weather cooperated for our Red, White, and Blue dance with Dan's superb ice cream.  It always helps to retreat to the basement to enjoy the refreshing cold treats.  We hope that thermometer will cooperate for the rest of the summer. 
 It's always fun to welcome people back from Arizona after our unusually moist winter turns rapidly to spring and on to summer.  Even the most ardent sun lovers decide that 119 degrees isn't their favorite comfort zone.  Of course, what makes our dances really great is our delightful duo, Randy Dibble with his lively calling and Jeanine Norden's excellent cuing.  Check out our dances for top-rated fun.
