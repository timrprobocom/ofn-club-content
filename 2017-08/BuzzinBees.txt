Who can believe that I am already writing about August? We have had a quiet summer as a club but August will start the ramp-up. Our caller, K C Curtis, will be doing square dance lessons at Lakeshore Athletic Club in Vancouver every Friday. The address for Lakeshore Athletic is 2401 NW 94th Street, Vancouver. The class starts at 11 and goes until 12:30. Angels are welcome.

The Bees summer camp out is coming up August 11th and 12th at Silver Springs State Park. Mike and Debbie Combs are camp host at that Park so we will be visiting them. Last year, a good time was had by all.

Lessons will start in September - more information next month. Enjoy the rest of your summer.
