If this reaches you before the last of July, make sure to hit our 5th Saturday all Plus dance at the Boring Barn. We have making our 5th Saturday dances a special event, so don’t miss this Surf’s Up beach theme with oldies music. Our 5th Saturday dances are $6 at the door and starting September 1st, all of our dances will be $6.00 per dancer. Most clubs have already gone there, and this year’s insurance bill on the Barn rose enough to send us down that path also.
 
    We will participate in the Boring and Dull Day again this year, serving ice cream. It is August 9th from 5 to 9 PM at the trail head park. Come out for a sweet treat to beat the hot weather. It is a chance for our club to get our name out in the community and tell them about our fall lessons coming up.

     Our current mainstream class will be finishing up as this comes out and we will take the month of August off and then start some new lessons September 14th. Scott Zinser will be teaching every Thursday evening from 7:30 to 9:30 PM. Let everyone know about this great activity!

     Come and dance with us on 1st and 4th Saturdays, 7:00 PM to 10:30 PM. We start with the first half hour of Plus level, then dance mainstream with intermediate rounds. We look forward to the cooler August nights. Come join us as it is always fun to dance with the Cut-Ups!
