Columbia River Dancers continue dancing at the Hazel Dell Grange in Vancouver on the 2nd and 4th Saturdays year-round with Jim Hattrick calling most of our 4th Saturday dances with guest callers on the 2nd Saturday.  We start at 7 pm with Plus and rounds till 8 pm, them Mainstream from 8-10 pm or so.  We have our break at the end of the dance.  We only go dark for certain festivals and when holidays coincide with our dance night.  These will be announced in advance.
 Square Dance lessons continue year-round on Tuesday evenings from 7-9 pm as well.  Jim Hattrick teaches on a 4-week rotation schedule. New students may start on the first Tuesday of any month. We generally have 4-5 squares of students and angels on the floor learning and having fun.  We only cancel lessons if the temperature is above 90Â°F in Vancouver at 5 PM.  So check the radio or TV for the local temperature.
 We have picked up 7-8 new members from lessons in the last 2-3 months - all ladies! (or right-hand-partners, if you desire).  Dale (our President) said that he would offer a $5.00 bounty on any new male students that anyone brings to lessons that stay through basic and $20 if they make it through Mainstream!
 On August 7th we will be having our Luau Dance featuring Darrell Kalmbach calling and Julie Stiers cueing.  See flyer below.
