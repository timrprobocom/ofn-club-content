The one element of square dancing that I love, with the Toes during the summer, is casual clothes are welcomed for dancing.  What a busy summer for our club.  Bev is cueing up a storm for us and we are thankful.  KC and Linda were gone to the Washington State Summer Festival in June, calling and entertaining many happy dancers, while George Hermann came to help us out for a dance, in their absence.  Thanks George.  June brought the best ever club Progressive Dinner.  We had almost 30 folks dressed as Roman citizens on one of the hottest days of this year, eating and solving a murder mystery.  Great food and great fun.
 Hope you were able to get down to Oregon’s Summer Festival.  So many fun choices to pick from and to do.  Also hope you are free to come on August 5th and visit the Kinton Grange for their 100th Anniversary Celebration with ice cream, carnival games, dance lessons and lots of great information on how we use our grange for community activities.  It’s a free event and runs from 2 to 5 p.m.  2 pm square dance lessons, 3 pm round dance lessons and 4 pm English dance lessons.  Come join us at 19015 SW Scholls Ferry Rd., Beaverton, OR.  We love our Kinton Grange.  We have two themed dances in August.  On the 4th Hot August Nights and on the 18th is Tropical Paradise Dance.  Bring your casual outfits and enjoy some fun summer dancing.  Our campout is at the end of the month down in Lincoln City.  We are looking forward to unwinding and loafing with our square dancing friends and family. 
 As we look ahead into September, it’s the 13th that our mainstream lessons start from 7 to 9 p.m.  Come bring a friend and join us.  We also are looking forward to our Anniversary Dance and putting on the State Dance later in the month.  We’ll see our own Kathy Roberts starting her new presidency position for the year.  She is a busy girl.  See you in a square.
