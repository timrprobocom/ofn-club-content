It will be another crowded night for us, Aug 9, as Mike Sikorsky once again graces us with his presence.  Come early so you have a good place to park.  Parking patrol supervisor Bruce Bruiser will be making sure you don’t park where you don’t belong.  Or, have your parking done by our friendly valet, Parker Parkit.  This will be our luau dance, so I’ll be there with a skimpy short skirt made of grass – like Mike Sikorsky, only he doesn’t have the legs for it.

The Back to School dance will be Aug 30.  Come join Mike Kious and Tami Helms, and don’t forget the school supplies, pretty please.

Our new kitchen chef, Cal Amari, says he will be serving surprise treats at all our dances this month.

We’re going to borrow an idea from our Country Cut-Up neighbors.  We, too, are going to have an open house.  Ours will be each Wednesday in August, 7:00 --7:30, with basic square lessons in September.
