With the upcoming retirement of Caller, Ray Holmes, the Rogue Squares decided in March to go to one dance a month with guest callers. The club is dancing on the 3rd Friday of the month.

The format of the Rogue Squares dances is: 6:30 to 7:30 — Advanced, 7:30 to 8:00 — Pre Rounds, 8:00 to 10:00 — Mainstream with every 3 rd tip Plus. The club felt this format would give all the dancers an opportunity to dance to the out of town or guest callers.

The Rogue Squares will be starting a beginner class on September 11 with a new and up-coming caller by the name of Phil Ramey. He is not new to square dancing, but he is new to calling. He is also extremely excited about teaching the class. He feels teaching will help him learn to call better as well as teaching new people square dancing.

The schedule of dances is as follows:

July — Club will be dark because the 3rd Friday is in the middle of the Star Promenaders' Diamond Lake Festival

August — on the 5th, Rogue Squares will celebrate their 2nd Birthday with Jim Steele from Bend calling and Mary Nutt cueing

On August 18 will be our "Raid the Garden" dance with Craig Abercrombie from Portland area calling and Elaine Funk cueing.

There is no one scheduled as yet for September and October.

November 17 will be our "Salute our Veterans" dance with Richard Lane calling and Elaine Funk cueing.

December 15 will be our Christmas Potluck & White Elephant Gift Exchange. The caller will be Wayne Weaver and Rikki Lobato will be the cuer.
