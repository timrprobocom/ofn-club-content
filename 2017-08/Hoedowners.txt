The sixth month of the year has come and gone but the Hoedowners took the opportunity to celebrate the great outdoors at both dances held in June.  The dining room was redolent with the sweet smell of freshly sliced strawberries on June 10th when we celebrated Oregon’s best with fruit fresh from the fields.  Don’t you love making your own strawberry short cake; as much whipped cream as you like and can anything match a Hood strawberry in June?
 On the 24th we held our first ever Camp Hoedowner Dance and it was a great success.  It was scorching hot but Aloha Grange remained cool and comfortable all evening.  A multitude of bears lurked, a campfire burned, and tree stumps and tents were visible.  The question of the evening was, “Did you go away to camp for a week or camp out with friends and family in tents?”  A genius named Debbie Olson decided we should have S’mores as part of our camp experience and everyone loved toasting their own marshmallows and hoping the chocolate melted.  It was a first S’more for some and there was quite a line at the S’more toasting table and the majority went back for seconds!
 August 12th will be the Hoedowner’s Here’s the Scoop Dance with ice cream sundaes.  We love enjoying summer, its heat and the excuse for an obligatory summer treat.
 August 26th, we’ll hold our Cool & Sweet Dance with melons and fruit.  Occasionally you have to plan a healthier menu.  Join us to dance with some cool and sweet dancers.
