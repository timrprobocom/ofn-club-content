The new IWW Board members have taken office and the club year is off to a great start.
We are hoping that by the time you read this news, we will have enjoyed gracious Hoedowner hospitality on a July 8 visitation to the Aloha Grange, will have had a blast dancing on the Capitol steps to The Crew, and will have enjoyed what promises to be a memorable Summer Festival. Kudos to the Summer Festival Committee and the many Summer Festival volunteers. 
The Hall will be dark in August for our usual dance times, but IWW will host a demonstration square dance at the Polk County Fairgrounds on August 19 as part of the Total Eclipse Celebration. All dancers are welcome, and urged to come.  We hope for a large turnout. Please wear your club outfits and, in honor of the occasion, sunglasses. See the flyer in this OFN issue for details.
Our regular dance schedule resumes on September 2, with George Hermann calling and guest cuers. Mainstream lessons begin September 10, 4-6 pm and Plus lessons begin September 24, 6:15â€“7:45. George Hermann will be teaching. Happy dancing! Dee and Bert Mackaman
