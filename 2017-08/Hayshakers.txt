We have been able to keep four new people coming faithfully for every dance.  Also, the new members from Wave Steppers have come to dance with us which really helps everyone.  We thank them.  Right now we are dancing the 1st and 3rd Saturdayâ€™s from 6 to 8.  This will probably change in the fall so you need to call before you come and visit.
 You need to be thinking about the Seaside Sashay which will be coming October 27th and 28th.  We would like to see you come and enjoy the dancing.  Our callers this year are Dan Preedy with Darrell Kalmbach and of course our cuer, Debbie Taylor.
