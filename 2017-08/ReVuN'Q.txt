The club celebrated 41 years with fun, friendship, camaraderie, and topped off with cake to celebrate. Thanks to all who came and partied with us.
We are finishing up some Rumba movements and then getting floor time for the rest of the summer. We will be putting together fall plans really soon and getting the flyers out for prospective students and returning students.
We welcomed guests from Utah that had been to Circle 8 Ranch in Cle Elum and were on their way home. It was lovely to have them with us. They are sticking around to attend Summer Festival also. Hope we see them again soon.
Jeanine Norden subbed for Cheryl in June and Christina Corelli will be subbing for Cheryl in July. We were dark for the second Thursday in July due to the Trails In Dance for Summer Festival. Gladly gave our dance night to the Capital Callers and Cuers so they could host the dance.
We also welcomed two new members to the club, Shari and Mark Schonbrun. Welcome aboard!  Marilyn Schmit
