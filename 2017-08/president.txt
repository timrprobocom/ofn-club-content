<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow, the last month has flown by real fast. But then, considering I was gone to national convention for a week and combating a messed up computer since I got home, I can relate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The convention was fun and there were 22 Oregonians in attendance. I have a list of 19 of them at home that I knew were there and two of them I introduced myself to in the Showcase of Ideas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are represented on the Executive Committee of United Square Dancers of America again with the election of Dale and Kathy Worthington to the position of Western Region Vice President. Please wish them well on their travels through the 13 states they represent as they share the vision and goals of the association. Their publication rack will be on display at Mid-Winter and I will try to get mine up for Summer Festival.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of Summer Festival, as I write this, it is a week away. By the time this prints, it will all be over with and the chairpersons are breathing a sigh of relief that their work is done and just need to finish up last minute things. Congrats on a job well done Neta and Ronda.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am spending the early parts of August getting the directory proofed and ready to take to the printer. The clubs and councils have been some good and some slow on getting their information submitted. There have been phone calls from Sylvia to some and emails and Facebook private messages from me to others to get information so the directory will be as correct as it can be at the time it is printed. Of course, something will be wrong with it as soon as the ink hits the first page. Just remember to let us know when you get your copy of any corrections that need to be made so the Master Copy can be fixed for the next printing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See you soon in a square, or a round dance.</p>
