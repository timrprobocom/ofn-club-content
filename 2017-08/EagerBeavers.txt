BIG NEWS! A Guinness World Record was broken by square dancers at Nationals in Cincinnati, OH.  Five Eager Beavers with seventeen other Oregon dancers participated in breaking the record for the greatest number of people dancing at one time.  Dancers had to go through turnstiles to be counted.  The earlier record was just over 1,000 but this one was close to 1,600.  There were judges on each of the four floors watching that everyone was dancing at a set time.  Everyone had a grand time and the River City Riders were a big hit.  
 Noble Woods Park is the site for our annual potluck picnic August 2nd at 3:00.  You can bring a friend.
 On Memorial Day we thanked our members who are veterans - all thirteen of them.
 We dance on most holidays.  Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 to 3:00 pm, at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
