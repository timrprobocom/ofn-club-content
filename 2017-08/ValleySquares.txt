Please join us August 5th for our Summertime Fun dance called by Scott Zinser and cued by Connie Clark, Aloha Grange. 7 p.m.  We begin with Plus followed by two MS tips.  Then it is every 3rd tip Plus.  We know many of you love root beer floats, so come to our Root Beer Float dance August 19th, same place and same time.
 We started the month of June searching for ripe strawberries, and most of us had to resort to supermarket strawberries instead of our delicious Oregon Hoods, which weren't ready for another week.  Craig Abercrombie called a lively, fun dance, and guests and club members had a rollicking good time.
 Renee Ruud dressed in Hawaiian garb and came up with creative ways for us to dance to Hawaiian-themed music at our Hawaiian Luau Dance.  She and Connie overlapped on a couple of songs, which just goes to show that there isn't a lot of Hawaiian music set up for square dancing.  Renee entertained us with her lovely voice and interesting tidbits of information about Hawaiian culture, words, and customs.
 If the Trophy Dance would have been held a couple of months later, we might have taken the trophy, as our membership numbers will be lower for 2017-18.  As it was, we came in second to the Tualatin Timber Squares when we visited the Rosetown Ramblers.  It was fun for me to talk with guest caller Don Wood, whose sons went to Timberline High School where I taught.  Don and his family lived on the other side of Long Lake from me.  
 Some of us ended the month by hopping on the Mystery Bus with Sunset Promenaders.
