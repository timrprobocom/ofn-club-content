Beachcombers danced on October 25, the day of the big storm that hit early that morning.  Our hall weathered the storm, but the dock in Port Orford suffered a lot of damage including the loss of a great little restaurant on the dock.  We had about 1 1/2 square of brave dancers that turned out in spite of high winds and power outages in some parts of Coos and Curry counties. Coleeta and Cathy did a great job of calling and cueing for us. We now have an official  club cuer, our long-time friend, Cathy Houston.  We look forward to many great dances! We will be dancing again on Saturday afternoon at 3 o'clock on November 22.  We will be hosting South Coast New Year's Eve Dance at 6 p.m. at the Beachcombers Cove.  Come join us for an early dance!
