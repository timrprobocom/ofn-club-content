 Welcome autumn, time for meeting new dancers and putting the dog days of a beautiful summer to rest.  R Square D had a full September.  We entertained four squares of rail riding hobos on the 12th and enjoyed a chili feed after the dance. Best dressed Hobo's were Mary McDaniel and Marv Pope. We enjoyed the calling of Craig Abercrombie who kept the floor rocking.  The next day we had a visitation to the River City dancers and collected a banner.  Our monthly meeting was held at Dick and Sandy Sims home with lots of good Mexican themed food. Thank you to our Hosts.
 The clubs yearly camping trip to Vista Park in Skamokawa WA was on a beautiful weekend with good fellowship and great food for all.  Over 30 people camped, stayed in yurts, tents, trailers and motor homes.  A good time was had by all. 
 November 14th brings us a Veterans Day dance with guest caller Steve Noseck and on the 22nd we welcome all to join us in our Thanksgiving dance.
