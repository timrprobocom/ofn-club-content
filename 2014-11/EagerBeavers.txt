 Our visitation to Tri-Squares was a good opportunity to visit with dancers that we do not often see.  We certainly enjoyed their great hospitality.  Thank you. 
  The longest active square dancer in the state has to be our own Genevieve Churchill who has probably served on every local and state committee that exists.  She has received many honors over the years but this time she was honored by the callers at Dance a Rama for the many years of service to the square dance community.  I think I speak for many people when I say: Thank you for all the years of hard work, Genevieve.  Speaking of Dance a Rama, it was terrific, well organized, and enjoyed by those attending. 
  Happy Thanksgiving to all. Give extra thanks to all our wonderful callers and cuers who make our dances special.  And thanks to all those great dancers who make it an event. 
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:15-3:15 p.m., at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.  Please check for up to date information at www.eagerbeavers.info.
