 The Club Campout was at Devilâ€™s Lake RV Resort in Lincoln City and was attended by 46 people from the Promenaders and several other clubs.  The weather was awesome and everyone seemed to have a good time.  We put together puzzles, sang songs, danced, visited, ate, and much more.
 The Promenaders celebrated our 29th Anniversary with a dinner and dance on October 4th.  Thanks to several clubs and independent dancers we had a big success with 97 dancers filling our dance floor as Chuck Garner called and Ken Pratt cued.  We also had Harold (Barbara) Kleve call a tip, he was our former caller and we enjoyed having them participate.  Prior to the dance we had a ham dinner with all the trimmings and everyone seemed to enjoy the meal; the Club worked hard to make this a special event.  Thank you all for coming and your support.
