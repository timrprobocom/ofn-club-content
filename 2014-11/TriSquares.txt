  It should be noted that TriSquares are auditioning for a new permanent cuer to replace our beloved Jackie, who has moved so far away it is impractical for her to travel to Tigard regularly. While we are missing her greatly, we will be using guest cuers until we find one that fits in with our club. Cuers interested in visiting us should call Frank Collett at 503-686-9835 (his cell).
  We also want to thank Duane Cope of Sign Scope Signs of Tigard for his original production of our sign about our lessons and his annual changes (so far) of the lesson dates on the sign. The changes have been gratis, and that is a big help. Thanks, Duane! Now, if we can just get him and his wife to the lessons.....
  Our Anniversary dance was a great success, with 62 people in attendance. The Halley brothers, Mike and Terry, were our callers, and Jackie Gale and Helen Halley shared cueing calls. Three clubs won banners from us. The picture board, with TriSquares members at the age of sixteen, provided much puzzlement and delight at trying to place names with pictures. At least one poodle skirt made its way to the dance.
  November themes are Saints, Sinners, and Scarecrows for November 1; and a Greatful Harvest and Pie Party for November 21. Sure hope to see YOU in a square!
  Anita Woodside
