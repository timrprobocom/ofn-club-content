  In September Toedragger's celebrated our 39th Anniversary with black-berry and blueberry dessert's and lot's of visitors.
 On September 14th, at our "Pink Dance" for the cure, we were able to donate $1284.00 to the Barbara G Kolman foundation.  Thanks to all the Toe's, visitors, callers and cuers who supported this endeavor by donating baskets, buying tickets for all the goodies, and giving time and money so generously. We collected about a third more than last year.  Whoopee!
 Also in September several of us along with KC and Bev went to dance at two assisted living care facilities.  We had a great time talking to the people and giving them some fun entertainment,  We met two people who said they had square danced many years ago, also one guy "Bob" who had danced with the Eager Beavers until fairly recently.
 On November 7th and 14th we will be travelling to Australia for Outback dances.  We have lots of great decorations for each place we visit.  So come get your Passports and join the trip.  These dances are also our annual food drive to collect food for those less fortunate.
