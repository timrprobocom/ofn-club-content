On the last Sunday of September, the Tualatin Valley Council held our annual Hahn Barn Dance.  With mildly warm temperatures we had enthusiastic dancers having a good time in the loft.  We started the evening with a pot luck dinner by the pond with Mother Nature being very kind!  After trying to finish all of the desserts, the 11 squares of dancers enjoyed the calling of Chuck Garner and Mike Stout with cueing provided by Julie Stiers and Julie Stout.  The Sunset Promenaders won the TVC banner for having the highest percentage of their club in attendance.  The TVC was well represented with 8 of the 10 clubs having members present.  We wish to thank Gary and Bette Hahn for their gracious hospitality.  Their contribution to this event is truly outstanding.
The next Council event will be a 5th Saturday dance on November 29th.  This will be a mainstream dance featuring the calling of the Wildcards and cueing by Helen Halley.  It will be held at Aloha Grange from 7:30pm - 10:00pm.
