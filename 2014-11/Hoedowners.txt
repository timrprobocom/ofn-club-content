 What a spectacular September we enjoyed this year, spectacular weather, spectacular sunsets and spectacular activities.  We kicked off the month with our Knobby Knees dance and it was certainly warm enough for short, shorts.  Everyone was casual and cool.
 On Sunday the 14th we had our kickoff event, the annual Fall Dinner Out at the Old Spaghetti Factory.  We had a chance to catch up on summer activities before lessons began.  September 17th was the first fall lesson and it’s an exciting class.  We have four charming youngsters taking with us.  Two boys and two girls who are all pros at learning dance steps as they take a mix of ballet, hip hop and jazz too.  
 Our Indian Summer Dance was the 27th.  The Running Bear Badge was available to earn.  That song is 55 years old and although performed by Johnny Preston was written by The Big Bopper.  Remember him?
 Fourteen Hoedowners attended the Hahn Barn Dance and once again it was perfect weather for a potluck picnic and dance.
On the 29th, ten of us had a great evening doing a wine and paint event.  Every painting was different and maybe a Rorschach test as well.  We had a mini art show at the next Wednesday lesson.  Was it a juried event? No, but you could see the artistic flair of each artist.
 What is a more iconic image than that of the American West?  It is so much a part of our lexicon in movies, music and mythology.   Please come and celebrate this part of our heritage on November 8th at our Wild, Wild West Dance.  Then, to continue our month of Americana, we’ll be having our 7th Annual Turkey Toss on November 22nd.  It’s a madcap combination of Thanksgiving and the carnival midway where a lucky toss can win you a turkey for your table.
