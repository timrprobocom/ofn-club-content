 The Wave Steppers are dark through the winter months.  We will resume our normal schedule in May of 2015.
 We’re only semi-dark, though, remember.  Winter is Class Time.  Round dance classes, which started September 7, will continue until about Christmas.  They’re at the Rockaway Beach Community Center; on Sundays, 3-5 p.m.  The Community Center is on the north end of town, just before you get to the high school.  Classes are taught by veteran cuer Connie Clark, and cost just $5 per person per session.  
 And square dance classes, taught again by caller Joe Wrabek, will happen again in January, and like this year’s classes, will be free.  Square dance classes will be held on Wednesday nights at the Elks Lodge in Tillamook, and begin at 6 p.m.  We’ll still be dancing at the Tillamook Elks on Wednesday nights through the fall and early winter; since the last class’s students have learned just about all of the mainstream program, what we’re doing is mostly practice.  If you’re in the area, do come.  There are usually cookies.
