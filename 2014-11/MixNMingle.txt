 Our Trophy Dance is this first Saturday in November.  It will be mainstream dance, a time for people to have their ambassador cards signed.  It will also be the time for the trophy to be passed along to the club with the highest percentage of members attending.  All of this will be celebrated with cake and ice cream for our 30th Birthday Dance.
