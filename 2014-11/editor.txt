This is the first demonstration issue of the online OFN.  I only received 
flyers from the Rogue-Sis-Q Council and the Tualatin Valley Council, and I 
haven't received any club news at all, so this is mostly information from 
the state directory.
<p>
If your dance information is incorrect, you can fix that by going to the
<a href="/ClubInfo/">state directory club info</a> area.  Use the "Dance" page 
to update your regular dance information, and use the "Edit"  page to edit 
specific dance information and update flyers.
<p>
For now, please send your club and council news articles directly to me.
<p>
Please be patient as we try to make this a useful resources for dancers 
both within and outside of the Federation.
