  As fall settles in, Valley Squares has filled our dancing days with autumn themes.  At our Back to School dance we collected school supplies to donate to local children.  The notebooks, pens, crayons, and pencils served double duty as table decorations.
 Our Goodbye to summer dance was called by Craig Abercrombie, who provided a fun evening for us and our guests from Rosetown Ramblers, Tri-Squares, Toe Draggers, and Hoedowners.  We appreciate the support of the dancing community as our membership is smaller this year.  We also enjoyed supporting our fellow clubs with official visitations to Wave Steppers and the Hahn Barn Dance.
 Our Mastering Mainstream/Beginning Plus lessons have been fun and challenging.  Come join us Tuesday nights at 7 p.m., Aloha Grange.  
 Please join us for our dance on November 1 and our Tailgate Party November 15 where hot dogs and tailgate snacks will be served before the dance at 6:15.
