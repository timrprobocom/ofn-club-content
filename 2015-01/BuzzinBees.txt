	Greetings and Happy New Year from the Buzzin' Bees. WOW! I just finished the uploading I needed to do for the new electronic version of the OFN. Very cool! As I write this I am a little sad at the close of an era for the OFN. It has been a publication I have looked forward to every month. Thank you to all who have contributed. 
	In November we had our first Elvis dance. Thank you, Mark "Elvis " Wheeler for a great dance. In December we decided to do a theme dance of Honoring our Seniors. We will collect items to donate to low income residents of local assisted living facilities for Christmas.  They can use stationery, shampoo,  socks, slippers, large print puzzle books,  writing items, lotion.  This is a population I work with in my job as a physical therapist so I see the need daily.  I want to thank the Buzzin Bees for contributing. It will make a difference in the lives of many.
	We hope you had a great holiday season and are ready for a fresh New Year.  Some of our upcoming dances include our Pajama dance, Sweetheart prom, Pie eating contest, Honey time, Legends, and our end of the year summer BBQ dance. But first, we are looking forward to Oregon mid-winter in January.  The Bees always gather for dinner on Saturday night and the last few years we have gone to Bo-Macks BBQ in Albany. Nothing better than good food shared with good friends.  Hope to see you there.
