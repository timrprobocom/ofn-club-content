Thank you to all the new dancers and club dancers who attended our first MWA New Dancers Dance on November 23. We had 11 squares of enthusiastic dancers and there were very few breakdowns. Yah!
For the MWA Fall Festival on November 29 we had a disappointing turnout of 31 dancers and almost half of them were from the hosting club. However, everyone had a good time and there were a lot of yummy refreshments. Thank you to the dancers who did show up.

 Editor's note: Due to the editor's short stay in the hospital, the December reports did not make it into the OFN. Therefore, I am including both the December and January reports from some of the clubs.
