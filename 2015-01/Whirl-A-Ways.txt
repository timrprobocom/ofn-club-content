Our New Dancers Dance on November 22 was attended by 7 squares with dancers from 7 of our area clubs, also dancers from 2 clubs outside of our area, and many New Dancers!
Our caller, Mike Kious gave everyone such a fun time-especially the New Dancers, what a great evening.

At the recent elections to the Hall Board of the Emerald Square Dance Center our members Marilyn Howard continued as Secretary and Carolyn Pape continued as Treasurer.  We appreciate their doing these positions.  Then on December 6 club members helped with putting up the Christmas decorations at the Emerald Square Dance Center.

Coming up our business meeting in January, and our regular dance on January 10.
Whirl-A-Ways will go DARK on January 24 for Mid-Winter Festival; where we look forward to dancing and re-connecting with friends from all around Oregon once again.
