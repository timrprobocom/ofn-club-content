     What can we say but "WOW!!!!!!"  This fall we had a great turn out of enthusiastic and fun-lovin' people ready to call themselves cloggers. We had over 20 people pre-register for our beginning class this September. This summer we danced at many fairs, markets, churches and picnics in order to enlighten people to the wonderful world of clogging. People saw us having a blast and they wanted to be a part of it. And now they are, and they are loving it! 
     Every Tuesday night at the Salem Square Dance Center in Salem, we have an eager group of new dancers intermingling with our regulars, and we are rocking!  We have two instructor/cuers, Cheri Posedel, who teaches the beginning and intermediate class, and Lori Buckley, who teaches Intermediate plus and advanced classes. This keeps the Square dance Center hopping for four plus hours.  
     We start at 4:00 p.m. with a group of enthusiastic intermediate dancers who just want a little slower pace to dance and a bit more repetition when learning new steps.  The pace is a bit slower but the laughs and giggles are right on cue! This hour of fun is followed by our beginner's class. This year we have more families participating, including some pretty awesome Dads. They are picking things up really fast. We already have a couple of songs under our belts! 
     We then move right into our intermediate class where our dancers are working on their style and their clogging know-how. We wrap up the evening with our Intermediate plus half hour and our half hour of advanced classes where our dancers are working on learning some of the more challenging styles of clog dance.  We all go home exhausted, inspired, and anxious for Tuesday to roll around again. CLOG ON!
