     Happy New Year! Every year is unique. Many things seem the same, and many things change. As dancers, we have to adapt to different callers, different venues and floors, different people in our squares, and new music to dance to. If we can apply that flexibility to the changing times, and adapt as the culture changes, as younger dancers come in, as our friends stop dancing for one reason or another, then we can keep square dancing alive. If we lose that flexibility, the culture will pass us by and we will be alive only in rare pockets and the pages of history. Even the OFN has to adapt to the changing times, becoming an online publication.
     Looking back, we are grateful for all those who have attended dances or other events, like the spring Barn Sale or the fall Pancake Breakfast. Without your support, we could not keep up our rustic, aging barn.
    Looking forward, 2015 will find us starting another mainstream class. January 15th we will kick off a free introduction to square dancing in a party atmosphere to bring in potential students. Scott Zinser will be teaching on a Thursday evening at 7:30 at the Boring Barn. Many Cut-Ups will attend the Mid-Winter Festival. We look forward to visiting other clubs, and welcoming them to come visit us. We hope to see many of you at the Barn this year!
