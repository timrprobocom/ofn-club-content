 Our visitation to the Hoedowners was well attended, 22 members, even though some came for a chance to join in their annual turkey toss.  Don't panic, no turkeys were harmed; bean bags were used. Four member's names were drawn and two of them won a turkey.  Yes, we also had a good time dancing.  
 Holidays are for celebrating and hope you all celebrated in your own special ways.  Hopefully some dancing was included. 
 Remember, dancing is an excellent way to keep warm so all plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:15-3:15 p.m., at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.  Please check for up to date information at www.eagerbeavers.info.
