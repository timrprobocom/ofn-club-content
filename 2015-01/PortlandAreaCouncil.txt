	It's our obligation to help our member clubs in whatever way we can.  And one of the ways is in the money department.  It's no secret that the Bachelor 'n' Bachelorettes netted $3,752.19 (along with the Salem Swingin' Stars) for hosting the Dance-A-Rama in August.  The Portland Area Council also netted several thousand for hosting two summer festivals in three years.  This goes to show that one of the surest ways to raise substantial sums is by holding a dance festival.  Other ways that have proven successful are having a food booth at a summer fair, selling fireworks at roadside stands, and even serving breakfasts.  By far, the most lucrative seems to be holding a weekend dance festival.  They Hayshakers did it by themselves for years!
	Few non-profits can go indefinitely without fundraising activities.  It's also a great way to build camaraderie and unity within a club.
	Our council is also looking for a webmaster and a special events person.  Apply with us.
	The State Federation is again offering youth scholarships.  Apply with us.
