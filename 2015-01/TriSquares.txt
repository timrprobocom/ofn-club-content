 TriSquares dancers are enjoying our time of auditioning and recruiting a new cuer.  We've heard some good ones so far, and I can't wait to listen and dance to the rest of the list.
  We had more pies than we could eat at our Grateful Harvest dance in November, and the ice cream and whipped cream toppings put it over the edge.
  Lined up for January, we will have Frosty's Waltz, a black and white ball Saturday, January 3. The third Friday, January 16, we will be celebrating Summer Down-Under. I guess I'll find out what the Aussies wear in summertime. Please join us.
  Don't forget - the big Mardi Gras dance will be coming up February 21.
