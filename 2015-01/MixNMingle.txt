 Our much-anticipated 30th Birthday and first mainstream dance proved great fun with Randy Dibble's lively calling.  Chaps and Petticoats went home with the trophy prize for the highest percentage of club attendees.  
 Now we hope for a winter without weather cancelations.  Be sure to check our website if in doubt.
