We had a well-attended Christmas Dance on December 20th.  The Whirl-A-Ways joined us in hosting this dance.  Roger Putzler and Mike Kious called, and Christina Corelli cued.  We had guests from a number of clubs.  The Single Trees had several members attending.  What a wonderful prelude to Christmas!
We look forward to 2015.
We graduated fifteen new dancers from the beginners' lessons!  Several angels from the different clubs were on hand Tuesdays and Thursdays to help out and have fun with the beginners.  Roger Putzler is the teacher, and we anticipate starting another new dancers' class in February.  Here's another chance to bring more people to the square dance fold.  The fun and camaraderie of square dancing is unique and for everyone of all ages!  Bring a friend or two or even more.
