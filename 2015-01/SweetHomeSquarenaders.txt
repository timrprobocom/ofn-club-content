Our Turkey Dance has come and gone.  It was a wonderful dance thanks to Jim Hattrick and Jackie Gale and our many visitors!  Thanks also to all our members who helped to produce ands serve a delicious turkey dinner.
We are excited to announce that our next dance will be our Big Foot dance on January 10th.  Big Foot has been hiding out in the woods for many years, but he has promised to attend our dance, and he will even bring his family!  You won't want to miss this exciting event.  The fourth Saturday we will be dark so we can all attend the Mid-Winter Festival!  In February we will be dark the second Saturday so we can attend Corvallis Squares' Birthday Party.  We will hold our own Birthday dance on the 4th Saturday, February 28th.  Come and help us celebrate.
