When we take a look back and reflect on the articles in the different issues of the Federation News over the years it brings back many "warm and fuzzy" memories.  Some clubs are still going strong while other clubs have quietly disappeared.  
It is interesting to take a stroll through the last 63 years of memories for the Buckeroo's  and think about the history of our Club.  The Buckeroo Barn in Roseburg was once a skating rink located near the Umpqua River and in the mid 50's the skating rink was taken apart by countless volunteers and moved piece by piece to its current location where it was reassembled by those same volunteers to become the Buckeroo Barn. We are very grateful to the dedicated volunteers who worked so diligently sixty plus years ago to see that our local square dancers had a place they could call their own.  We are proud to own the Barn and we love the beauty of the maple dance floor.
Like so many Clubs, our membership is only a fraction of what it was when it was first formed in 1952 but our members still believe that square dancing is truly friendship set to music and we honor the friendships that are made through square dancing.  Because we are the only square dance facility in the area, we encourage and appreciate folks who visit us at the Barn to dance.   We always feel fortunate that folks make the trip to Roseburg to dance with us.  Life goes on and things change so as we say "goodbye" to the monthly Federation News publications that have greeted us each month in our mailboxes for the past 58 years, it's time to look ahead to a new and exciting online publication that will be waiting for us on our computer screens. 
Keep us in mind whenever you are heading north or south on I5, and drop in and dance with us on a Saturday night!

Hoping to see you on the dance floor,
Rita Schuchard
