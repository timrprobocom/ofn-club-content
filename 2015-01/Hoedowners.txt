 No one knows where November went!  We kicked off the month with the toe of our cowboy boots on November 8th at our Wild, Wild West Dance.  We were twirlin' dancers not ropes and rounding up hot dogs instead of "little dogies" But we enjoyed the fun and flavor of the old west.
 November 19th was our annual New Dancer Spaghetti Dinner.  We had a beautiful candlelit dinner of Italian favorite's right down to the tiramisu.  Volare, Mambo Italiano, and a little Italian opera serenaded us as we dined.  
 The infamous Turkey Toss Dance was held on the 22nd.  Several techniques were used by potential winners.  We had the bowling delivery as well as the horseshoe and slow-pitch styles.  I think the bowlers tended to win.  The crowd was cheering the winners and losers.  Nine lucky dancers left with turkeys for their holiday tables.   
 January for the Hoedowners always begins with our Black and White Sparkle Dance on the 10th.  Most of the dancers will come dressed in black and white and the ballroom will be sparkling with mirrors and twinkling lights.  It's a great dance to begin the New Year.  Please join us!
 The 23rd, 24th and 25th will find a large contingent of Hoedowners in Albany for the Mid-Winter Festival so we will be dark on the 24th.  We have club activities planned as well as a memorable dance weekend.  Hope to see you there.
