	Welcome to the New Year!  May we continue to support one another in reaching out to all those "don't-yet-know-it-but-wanna-be-square-and-round-dancers"!
	Be sure to read the transcript of an on-air interview with our caller, Mike Halley, on KOD Radio.  For a copy of the transcript click on the "December 2014 Newsletter" on our newsletter page of the Oaky Doaks website:  www.oakydoaks.com.
	Our Oaky Doaks' new year opens with our "Poor Man's Dance" - a fundraiser for Annie Ross House.  This is the only emergency family shelter in Clackamas County serving those currently experiencing homelessness.  But Annie Ross House is more than a bed.  They connect families to the information and support services that help them move from a crisis of homelessness to stable and secure lives in permanent and affordable homes.  Donations of non-perishable food will go to their 'pretty bare' food pantry.  These donations will reduce your door fee to just $4.  If you are unable to attend the dance consider making a cash donation to Northwest Housing Alternatives, Inc earmarked Annie Ross House.
It's January and that means Mid-Winter Festival.  We're looking forward to dancing together down in Albany.  See you there!  With our dancing shoes on and ready to go!
