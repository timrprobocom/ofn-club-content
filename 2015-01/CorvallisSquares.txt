     (December) We had a festive and well-attended Halloween Dance on October 25. Jim Voll called, and he has a history with our club that goes back many years when he and Joyce taught lessons for us. Our cuer for the dance, Sandra Pinion, is newer to the scene and did a great job also. 
     Our mainstream lessons are going well under Bruce and Judy's excellent guidance, and we have about 14 enthusiastic new dancers. We're planning to carpool to the Area New Dancers' Dances to encourage as many as possible to attend these fun dances. In December we're looking forward to our Christmas Dance, and then will be dark the fourth Saturday in December. Wishing Happy Holidays to all!
      (January) Our mainstream lessons continue this month, with Bruce Lowther instructing. We've attended some of the New Dancers' Dances with our students and it's been a fun and festive time. Our club is hosting a New Dancers' Dance on January 10 and we look forward to it. Coming up in March is our annual Coast Trip, March 13 and 14, when we'll be dancing both nights at Gleneden Beach Community Club. All are welcome!  Karen
