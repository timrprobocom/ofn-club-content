 As we begin the New Year 2015, we also begin this new adventure with our online magazine.  Personally I shall miss my paper version of the OFN coming in the mailbox.  It has been something that we have looked forward to year after year to plan all of our square-dancing activities.  But, as we say goodbye to the old and hello to the new, I would like to say a big thank you to all those who made the OFN possible for all these past years.  Also thank you Tim Roberts for taking on this new endeavor, the online version.  A year from now we will be use d to it as the norm.
 Toedraggers begin lessons on January 4th.  Squares start at 2:30 pm followed by Rounds.
 Don't forget to come get your Passports stamped as the Toe's continue their journey around the world dances, first and third Fridays at Kinton Grange.  In January we will tour France with a Topsy Turvy theme on the 2nd.
 A Happy and Blessed New Year to all our dance friends.
