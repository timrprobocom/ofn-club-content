	The Squaws and Paws will be dancing their last 2nd Friday dance on December 12.  Mark Wheeler will be calling in place of our regular caller Jim Hattrick, who we all know is unable to do so.  Our club held a meeting a decided to cancel all future Friday nite dances except for this last one.  We will have our 4th Saturday dance on December 27.  We will continue to have our Sunday (round, plus, mainstream) lessons in December and January in partnership with Chaps and Petticoats.  The Beginner Jamboree held last night was a great success and we would like to give a great big Yellow Rock to Betty Chipps for her great ability for ambassadoring this event.
	We will be dark for our January 24th Saturday dance due to the Mid winter Festival.
