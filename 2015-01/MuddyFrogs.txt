The Milton-Freewater Muddy Frogs have completed the cha cha social ballroom lessons and will begin waltz lessons in February.  The square dance class continues and is going well.   Class members have been joining us for regular dances, which are called at class level and made fun for everyone.

By the time you read this, the Frogs and Family-a-Fair will have celebrated the New Year with a joint dinner, dance and games at the Frog's hall.  This is always such a fun event! 
 
Best wishes to all of you for health, contentment and much dancing in 2015!
