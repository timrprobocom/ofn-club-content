	The Silver Stars will have many people attending Midwinter Festival in Albany at the end of January.  We are looking forward to renewing friendships formed in years past as well as making new ones.  Our club will be dark on this Saturday so we are able to do this.
	We have our calendar full through June with guest callers--please watch our ads to see who is on our schedule.  Dorothy Lowder continues to be our cuer--we appreciate her so much.
	Mainstream lessons continue on Tuesday evenings with George Herman doing the teaching.  We had a well attended New Dancer Jamboree in November with 7 - 8 squares on the floor most of the night.  What a fabulous evening with George calling and Dorothy cueing, showing the new dancers what a fun time can be had when all are working(dancing) to a common goal--fun.
We continue to wish Jim Hattrick well as he continues his recovery.  Warm wishes and thoughts to Judy as she continues to care for him.  You both are in our prayers and thoughts.
	Heres to a fabulous January.  Stay safe and Happy Dancing.
