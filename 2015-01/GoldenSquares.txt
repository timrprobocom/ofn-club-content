     BIG NEWS: Golden Squares will be holding advance dances every 5th Saturday, with the club money going to Jim Hattrick. The first dance will be held January 31 from 7:00 to 9:30 PM. The club took donations at our November dance and raised $325.00 for Jim.
     We celebrated Christmas with a dinner on December 1 with 25 attending. Following dinner, we had our annual game (exchange the Christmas ornament). Five different clubs attended our dance later that evening.
