 We are planning on having our square dance lessons starting on Sunday January 4th, 2015 from 4 to 6 pm.  We hope to get a good and big class this year.
 The Promenaders have started a Thursday evening Plus dance featuring Darrel (Erin) Kalmbach as caller, and Ken (Dianne) Pratt as cuer.  The times are Intermediate Round Dance from 7:00 to 7:30 pm.  Plus dance from 7:30 to 9:30 pm with a finger food break after.
 We followed Mike and Julie Stout on a visitation to the Chaps and Petticoats at Maplewood Grange; our own Mike and Julie called and cued for the dance.  The weather was terrible for driving with rain and wind but the dance was fun and everything turned out fine; Aurora is a long way from Hillsboro. 
 We are planning to put on the Seaside Sashay next year with the Hay Shakers and we are starting our planning now.  This year's event was quite successful and we hope to have an even better program next year.   
 The Sunset Promenaders hope that everyone had a great Christmas, and now a happy new year; wow that was a fast year.  Now to get going in 2015, God bless!
