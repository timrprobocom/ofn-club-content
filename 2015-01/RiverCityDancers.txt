	Our New Dancer classs is progressing well toward a graduation on January 11.   Les and Renee have done a great job.  We have also had an enthusiastic committee co-chaired by Janet Johnson and Ira Evans, as well as LuWana Hansen and Gary Rodacker.  They will graduate with pomp and circumstance, and maybe some other props.
	Our dance hall will host a New Dancer extravaganza  on January 18 from 2:00-4:30 PM.  It will feature the calling of THE CREW.  This is intended as a warm-up for Mid-Winter.
	See you at Mid-Winter, if not before.
