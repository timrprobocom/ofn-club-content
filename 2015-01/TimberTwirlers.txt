     Our club is having a very fun year. We will be holding our New Dancers dance at a new location, the United Methodist Church at 1115 28th SW in Albany. We hope to make that our new home for dances. We will try it out for a couple of dances and if all works well we will let everyone know. Happy Holidays and hope to see everyone out dancing and having a holly jolly time this season..
