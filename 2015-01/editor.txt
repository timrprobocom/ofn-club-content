There has been a lot of confusion about what information you can include
in the online OFN, and how you get that information presented.  I'm going
to try to summarize that as best as I can.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Club and Council News:</b> I would like you to continue to handle club 
and council news just like you have been handling it all along.  Club 
reps should send their news items to their Area Editors.  The Area Editors
will gather them all up and send them to me. The deadlines will be up to
the Area Editors.  As long as they are to me by the 10th, all will be
well.
<li>
<b>Pictures:</b> For now, please send your pictures directly to
<script> shroud('timr','probo','com','me by email'); </script>.
I am in the process of adding a method for you to upload them directly,
but it's not there yet.  Please include a few lines about the picture
that I can use as a caption.
<li>
<b>Changes in Caller, Cuer, or Schedule:</b> You are in control of the
dance information that gets displayed in the main section down below.
You can change the callers and cuers, you can set a theme, you can make
a dance go dark (or not).  You can even add additional special dances.

To do any of that, you need to go to the 
<a href="/ClubInfo/">state directory club info</a> area.  Use the "Dance" page 
to update your regular dance information, and use the "Edit"  page to edit 
specific dance information.
<li>
<b>Dance Flyers:</b>
You can update your flyers on the same page where you change the themes
and callers.  Flyers should be full page (8.5" x 11"), and need to be either
JPEG or PDF.  The web site will make a small thumbnail to go in the 
flyer collection just below.
<li>
<b>Lesson Information:</b>
You can also update your lesson information on the state directory
page mentioned above.  Use the "Lessons" tab.  Contact 
<script> shroud('timr','probo','com','me by email'); </script>
if you have trouble.  Note that you can add both square and round
dance lessons.
<li>
<b>Available Callers and Cuers:</b>
The "available callers and cuers" list is now included in the online
OFN.  If you are a caller or cuer who wishes to be included, please
send your contact information to the editor.  The cost is $12 per year.
<li>
<b>Non-Federated Advertising:</b>
We are just about ready to include advertising from non-Federated
sources.  The tentative pricing will be $15 for a one-time flyer,
$30 for three months, or $100 for one year.  All ads will need to 
be full-page PDF or JPEG files.  We will include a list of thumbnails,
just like we do for the Federated club dances below.
</ul>
<p>
Please be patient as we try to make this a useful resources for dancers 
both within and outside of the Federation.
