Happy New Year!

Our turkey raffle at our November dance was very successful.  Preston Clement won the turkey!

Our caller, Sherm Welch and his wife, Carol, are traveling across country by train to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.  Congratulations to you both!  He will be back this month to continue on with our class.  Cheri Cox will be substituting for him until then.

Mid-Winter is coming up and many club members will be in Albany for some great dancing.
See you in a square!

We are sorry to see that the hardcopy of the OFN is going away. It was always nice to receive it in the mail each month and then sit down and read about all the club activities around the state.  Hopefully the online version will be successful in keeping us up-to-date on current events in the square dancing world.

Happy Dancing!
