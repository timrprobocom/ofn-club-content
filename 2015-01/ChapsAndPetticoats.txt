	On November 23rd we hosted a New Dancer dance and served a Turkey dinner after the dance -- we had nine squares on the floor!  If you want to have a crowd - serve food was the conclusion. Thank you to all who attended and kept our New Dancers smiling. 
	Can you believe it is January 2015?  We are viewing our last "news-print" published OFN magazine. I, for one, will miss the paper version.  While I do business via the internet, approximately 40% of our Club members are not internet savvy.  We will need to tag-team to ensure they continue to be informed. 
	Our January dances will include food served after the dance. On Jan 2, Scott Zinser and Jackie Gale will call/cue, so help us bring in the New Year.  Mike and Helen Halley will entertain us on January 16 -- no theme - just dance.
	Our February dances are theme dances!  February 6, Chaps will host the Tri-council "win-the-TROPHY" dance:  the club with the greatest percentage of membership in attendance wins the TROPHY, and thus hosts the next dance.  February 18, features Les Seeley calling our "Flintstone" dance.  We hope you will attend - we'll make it a memorable time.
Have a happy 2015! Happy Feet,
Betty Chipps
