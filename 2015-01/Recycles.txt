	The excitement and festivities of the Holiday Season are past us now, but you can put some "additional" fun into the New Year by dancing "Plus" with the Recycles at our dance on Friday, January 9th!
	Our dance will be a great way for new Plus dancers to get in some more practice before going to Mid-Winter Festival, and Scott and Jeanine always provide a wonderful evening for veteran dancers, too.
 	Thanks to faithful donators, we are amassing many pounds of aluminum tabs for the benefit of the Ronald McDonald House.  Thank You for taking the time to collect for a good cause!
