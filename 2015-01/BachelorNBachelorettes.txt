     It's been said that morality is never back and white, but our dances certainly can be.  We'll prove it on our January 28 Black and White Ball.  So come with your black suits and white ties, or your black dresses and white petticoats.  Ohhh, we'll have a time of it!
	But even before that, we'll be primed up after having been to Mid-Winter.  There's something for everybody at Mid-Winter.  If you can only make one festival a year, Mid-Winter is the place to go.
     January 31st, we'll be at the Evergreen Council Dance, as our long tenured member, Jack Grauer, will be honored for 45 years of dancing.  Wont you join us in tribute?
