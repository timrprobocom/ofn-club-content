 Valley Squares starts 2015 with our new set of Basics lessons beginning Tuesday, January 13, 7-9 p.m. at Aloha Grange.  
 Football playoffs are filling the air waves, and our Tailgate Party Dance featured hot dogs, salads and beans for the dancers to work off on the floor.  Decorations of Ducks and Beavers eyed one another across the floor.  Hoedowners walked off with one of our banners.
 Our Welcome Fall dance was small, low-keyed, but fun.  Chuck puts passion into his songs and has a great voice.  Connie keeps folks circling in the Rounds. 
 A few of our mates donned pirate attire and raided the Pirates Dance at Chaps and Petticoats.
 Hope to see you at our dances January 3 and 17, Aloha Grange.
