      We had a great dance for our Turkey Dinner - thanks to everyone who came.  Upcoming dances include our New Dancers dance in January which will also have a baked potato dinner at 7:00 p.m. Our birthday dance  will be in February and our youth will have their fundraiser dance on March 8 from 2:00 - 5:00 pm. 
     Our youth are already starting to fundraise for their trip to the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival in May. They have festival pins and raffle tickets and they will also have a silent auction at their dance in March. We have some of the kids interested in competing in the rounds this year as well as the squares! See you at a dance soon.
