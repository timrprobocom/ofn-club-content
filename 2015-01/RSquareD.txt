 We saluted our veterans with a rousing dance on November 14th, Thank You to our Military. Steve Noseck was our caller with a little help from Bill Luadine, Lonnie Sycks did the cueing.  We had visitations from Buzzin Bees, Cougar Squares, Harbor Haylofters, Happy Hoppers and Hoedowners.  Everyone marched to the music and enjoyed the evening of honoring those who serve. 
 The 17th of November found us gathering for our monthly meeting hosted by Charlotte and Cliff Houghtlen, thanks to them both. 
 On November 22nd we hosted our Thanksgiving dance, Craig Abercrombie gobbled his way through the evening and provided an enjoyable time for all. Lonnie Sykes provided additional cueing and cackling, we trotted the evening away. Visitations were from Stardust, Ruff and Ruffles and Cougar Squares. 
 R Square D lost a friend and dancer this month.   Bill Lammi was put to rest on the 17th with many attending his service. We will miss seeing him come through our dance hall entryway. 
 Please join us for our Snowflake Frolic on January 9th, hot soup to feed the body and good fellowship to feed the soul. R Square D will be dark on the 24th. 
 New square dance lessons start January 7th, Ya all come!  For more information about the R Square D club please visit our website at www.r-square-d.info or friend us on Facebook. 
 Stay warm and Happy Holidays.
