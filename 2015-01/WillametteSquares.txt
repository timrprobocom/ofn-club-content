      (December) Willamette Squares held their jack-o-lantern themed 20th birthday dance. Many dancers came in costume, which made for extra frivolity. Accompanying the birthday cake and ice cream, there was the usual fine spread of finger foods and a cauldron of fizzy blood red punch which was kept chilled by a random icy hand floating just beneath the surface. Everyone enjoyed dancing to Sandy's choice singing calls and recognizing Willamette Squares' twenty years of existence! Scrapbooks and photo albums brought back pleasant memories of people and dances gone by. We are looking forward to our lovely traditional Thanksgiving dinner in November. Thanks to all who made our birthday dance memorable. 
      (January) Willamette Squares held their annual Thanksgiving dance the end of November. There was an air of thankfulness as everyone danced and partook of a traditional Thanksgiving feast so ably organized by Nancy Baker and helpers. The fall decorations shed a festive light on the square dance center as memories of previous Thanksgiving celebrations came to light. We were all thankful that we could gather our square dance family together once again.
