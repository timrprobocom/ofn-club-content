We were so lucky to have Kris Jensen call our lessons/dance in late November following our special dance the week previous.  Kris did a fantastic job calling all levels for the special dance.  Spin Cycle Squares had their famous potluck and an incredible silent auction.  Guests from the Portland area were in attendance and all had a grand time dancing to Kris.
We are now looking forward to 2015 with hopes for a new dancers' class starting January 11th.  We dance Sundays from 5:30 - 8 p.m., so there is plenty of floor time for all of the levels.  Please be thinking of people to invite to lessons.  Folks just have no clue how much fun they are missing.  We dance in Hall A at the Emerald Dance Center at 2095 Yolanda in Springfield.  Please call our president, David Lajoie, for information, (541)520-7311.  Tim Mattieson is our very capable caller and teacher.
Happy dancing!
