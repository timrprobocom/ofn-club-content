Happy New Year!! It is hard to believe after 2 years of planning Mid-Winter 2015 is 3 weeks away.
Jet Roberts (featured caller), Peter and Chama Gomez (featured round dance cuers) and Shane Gruber (clogging instructor) are all very excited to be coming to Mid-Winter 2015.  Our committee has worked very hard to get a great party planned.  It sounds like all we need is YOU!!!  If you have not registered yet, be sure to do so ASAP as the price increase goes into effect January 16th.  There are some great values in nearby Hotels.  There will be a sewing clinic, lots of vendors, two dance demonstrations, trolley service to restaurants and hotels, after parties,  Showcase of Rounds and much more. So come early and stay through the entire festival -- you don't want to miss a thing.
