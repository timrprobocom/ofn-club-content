The Ramblers will be ringing in the New Year in style at our annual Black and White Ball on Saturday, January 3, 2015 at the Milwaukie Grange. Although our title suggests formality, formal attire is by no means required. We encourage dancers to dress comfortably and be creative with the black and white theme. We'll have a potluck from 6 to 7 and alternate Mainstream and Plus tips from 7 to 9:30. Our caller will be Stephen Cole.

We'll be kicking off our winter session of Mainstream lessons with a "free taste" of square dancing on Wednesday, January 14 at the Ankeny Street Studio, SE 9th and Ankeny, in Portland. Admission is free for all dancers. We'll dance from 7-9 pm. No prior experience is necessary, and singles and couples are welcome. Casual dress.

 

Our lessons will start the following the Wednesday, January 21, and continue on Wednesday nights from 7-9 pm at the Ankeny Street Studio.
