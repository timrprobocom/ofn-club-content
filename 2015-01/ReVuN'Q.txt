     (December)The club has waded into West Coast Swing with about five to six couples in class. Much too small, but we will persevere and keep on going. Many things to remember and keep track of in order to be in the right place and ready for the next step "1". And yes, we have learned that "and" can be considered a number also, 
     Ray missed class on October 30, due to some back issues. Hope he is feeling better as of the writing of this article. Virginia celebrated her birthday on Halloween and Ray celebrates a birthday on December, a momentous one, to boot. We look forward to celebrating many more with both of them. 
     We encourage Phase 3-4 dancers to come and join us as we get floor time every Thursday working through the various dance styles for practice and getting the steps down through repetition and fun. 
     The holidays are rolling around and the ReVuNQ dancers wish our friends and neighbors a Happy Thanksgiving and a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Come and join us on Thursdays and work some of that food off the waistline. 
     (January)Our club is small in attendance for classes but we are having fun anyway. We were dark for Thanksgiving as we will be for Christmas. We are planning a Christmas party for December 18 for something to make the season what it is.
     There was an open house at our instructor's house on November 29 for Ray Walz's 80th birthday in early December. Have not heard how it went as I was ill and had to miss it. Drat!!
     We are having a meeting after the first of December to discuss future lessons and what we can do to bring the class attendance back up or to discuss what we are doing wrong and driving them away. I will let you know what we find out. Happy Holidays and Happy New Year!
