It was a great dance June 17th, with about four squares (our usual amount).  Among our visitors, we had some from the Charlie Brown’s and Dancing Friends (from down south), on their way to the dance festival north of Seattle.

Disposable masks were offered, but no takers; in fact, there wasn’t a mask to be seen!  Most claimed to be vax’d.  Or, it may have been in deference to a physician report saying that exercising with a mask was not a good thing.  Other clubs are opening in July, but the B&B’s have always been a forward-thinking club.

One highlight was learning our club cuer (Tami Helms) has signed up with us for yet another year!
