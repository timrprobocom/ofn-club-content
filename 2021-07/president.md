As I write this July report in June I’m aware that dancing activity is picking up across the state, due to the relaxed Covid restrictions.  The buzz from those that have danced is that they have had a great time and are thrilled to be back on the floor.  Keep in mind all of the current CDC guidelines as you make plans to start dancing again.  Be sure and check with your dance hall’s limitations and policies to get approval to open up.

Post your flyers on the OFN and the Federation Facebook page with any restrictions listed, along with door fees.  Continue to have club meetings with Zoom or in person to communicate plans for the startup activities.  Plan for classes in September and get the word out.  Discuss the possibility of using the Caller Lab approved Social Square Dancing format.  Let’s get this activity started again and have some fun this summer.  

Enjoy some summer campouts with your club.  Outdoor activities and dances are fun and should have fewer restrictions.  Advertise everything you are doing for a bigger turnout.

Swing Your Partner……………Happy 4th of July!!
