We are tentatively planning to hold our July 17th dance, but a final decision has not yet been made. Watch for a flyer and update.

We are so looking forward to classes starting back up in September and getting back to normalcy. Weâ€™ve missed dancing and look forward to seeing you on the dance floor!!
