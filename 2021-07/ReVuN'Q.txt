We had a very good dance on May 15 with nine couples in attendance. The music flowed and the dancers had an enjoyable time with no masks for those who were fully vaccinated. We have another dance scheduled on July 17. It is titled “Mid-Summer Nights”, so come and enjoy another relaxing evening of phase 3-4 round dancing to the cueing of Randy Lewis.
We finished Bolero at the end of May and started West Coast Swing in June. It will be interesting to see how much of that we all remember from previous classes. Come and join us to refresh your dance movements. 
We are still processing plans for a phase 2 dance in early August for the beginning dancers to get their dance feet back in shape. We hope that things work out for that. Stay tuned.
Hope your Independence Day weekend is filled with family, food, and lots of safe activities. Marilyn Schmit
