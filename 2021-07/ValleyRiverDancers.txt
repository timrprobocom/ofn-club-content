Valley River Dancers have begun dancing again!   In July we will be having mainstream dances on the 2nd Friday, July 9th, and our Dance Under the Stars on the 4th Friday, July 23rd,  These will be mainstream Dances.  We will also be having an A-Dance on the 5th Saturday, July 31st.  The locations for these dances are still to be determined.  Updates will be posted on our Facebook Page:  Valley River Dancers.
 Some of our club members have been dancing in Salem and at Abernathy Grange with clubs there.  We are looking forward to seeing everyone again and re-polishing our dancing skills.
