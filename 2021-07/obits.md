Marshall Lee Thorsen

Feb. 13, 1942 - June 6, 2021

Born in Seattle, Wash., to Carsten and Alice (Nelson) Thorsen. The family moved from Seattle to Fairbanks, Alaska and then to Lake Oswego, Ore.

Marshall graduated from Tigard High School in 1960 and then attended PCC, receiving his degree in manufacturing engineering. He was set up on a blind date by his best friend, and later fell in love with the former Barbara Bonebrake, marrying her 2 years later.

Marshall was an extremely enthusiastic square dancer and spent decades "angeling" new dancers into the pastime he loved. Marshall spent endless hours with wife, Barbara, volunteering time and effort collecting and distributing food donations to Meals on Wheels and the Tualatin Senior Center. He was extremely hard working and could fix almost anything. It wasn't necessarily pretty, but it worked!  

Preceded in death by both parents; and brother, Richard Thorsen, Marshall is survived by his wife of almost 54 years, Barbara Thorsen; his daughter, Lisa and son-in-law, Greg; his granddaughters, Taylor (Robert), Ashleigh (Michael), Whitnie, and Sophie; sister, Linda (Pat), sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law, Lucille and Jim (deceased), Charles (Brenda), and Robert (Carolyn), and Melinda; and many cousins and friends here and in Norway.

He will be remembered for his kindness, sense of humor, enthusiasm for life, and I am sure he would want us to add, what a handsome boy he was. Marshall was baptized in the Spring of 2013, and we are comforted by the knowledge that he is in the presence of Our Heavenly Father. Services are planned tentatively for July 18, 2021, in Oregon at a location, TBD.

Marshall was a Vietnam Era Veteran Army Cryptographer.
