The May TVC meeting was held via Zoom.  New COVID rules were discussed along with the news that four TVC clubs have resumed dancing, Eager Beavers, Hoedowners, Sunset Promenaders and Valley River Dancers.  All four are using caution having face masks optional with proof of vaccination.  See individual club flyers for more information.  
 Very little discussion on SSD.  It was reported that Callerlab voted to add Social Square Dancing (SSD) to the Program Policy Statement as "an alternate entry-level destination dance program, intended for use without requiring any change to any other dance program."   At Mid-Winter SSD will be offered either in the Mainstream or the New Beginner Hall in 2022.
 The TVC Picnic has been scheduled for Sunday, August 15th at Noble Woods Park in Hillsboro. Everyone is welcome, and details will follow.
