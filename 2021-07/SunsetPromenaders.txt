Important notice!   Since the maximum occupancy for the Odd Fellows Hall at this time is 60, the Sunset Promenaders are requiring participants to register for our Saturday night mainstream dances.  To reserve your spot, please contact Joyce Clark by text at 503-310-0272 or by e-mail at Joyceaclark007@gmail.com.  To be able to dance mask-free, you will need to provide proof of vaccination (Covid-19 vaccination card, original or copy, or a picture of it on your phone); for convenience, weâ€™ll be keeping track of those that present proof of vaccination so you need to do it only once.  Please bring your own beverages as there will be no refreshments available.  As state-mandated restrictions change, these requirements will be adjusted accordingly.  Thank you for your patience!
