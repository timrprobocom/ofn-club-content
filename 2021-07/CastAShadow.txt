Good news!  We have started up our advanced program to recorded music once again.  Only vaccinated dancers can dance with us at this time and proof of vaccination must be provided and a waiver form signed the first time a dancers dances with us. 

We had our first dance on Jun 13th and perhaps another one on June 27th depending on response from a survey to be taken after this article was submitted.  If all goes well we will try to dance two times a month on Sunday afternoons in Hall B at 2095 Yolanda, Springfield, from 1:30 to 3:30PM.  Please check our website (cas-sq.yolasite.com) and perhaps call to make sure the dance is onâ€”obviously without a square of dances we will hold no dances.  You may call Fred Beisse at 541-683-2522 or Gaynor Hintz 541-741-4149.  If you wish to be placed on a notification list, please contact Fred.

Please come join us if you are an advanced dancer, live in the area or are passing through.  The recorded tips are always to national callers, and we even have a few national callers come call for us on occasion.

See you in a square,
