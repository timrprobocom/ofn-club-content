We went to a square Dance!! Hallelujah! Oh, what fun we had @ the Sunset Promenaders!
 It brings such promise of getting back to the dance floor for all of us. The Toe’s are tentatively starting up on September 17th, which will be our 46th Anniversary dance. Then we will have one dance in October and that will be on the 1st.  More news of the Toe’s to come as things progress.
 Happy 4th of July everyone!
