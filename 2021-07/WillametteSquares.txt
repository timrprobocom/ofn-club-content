After not meeting for so long because of the pandemic, and with so many people now vaccinated, Willamette Squares is ready to get back to hosting a dance on June 26, starting at 7:00 P.M. with pre-rounds and continuing at 7:30 with mainstream squares and rounds. The dance will end at 9:30. Masks are required unless you have been vaccinated. We will no longer be serving food but will have individually wrapped hard candies and mints, and water will be available in disposable cups. There will be hand sanitizer available between tips.

Judy Russell is our clubâ€™s new cuer. Many thanks to Jackie Gale for all the cueing she has done for us in the past. Please note the earlier time as we resume our regular dances. If a square happens to break down, Sandy Harris, our caller, will stop and reteach any moves that are needed. Many of us have not danced for so long we may require a little extra help now and then. We are so excited to be back on the dance floor and seeing so many of our friends. So get your square dance duds out of the closet and join us for a fun time! Jodee
