The Country CutUps are excited to announce that they are back to square dancing effective July.  The CutUps dance first, fourth, and fifth Saturdays.  Our first full dance will be Saturday, July 3rd with Scott Zinser calling and Leonard Snodgrass Cuing. This has been way too long of a pause and are ready to see all the familiar faces back in our barn.
