May 2021 is in the history books, and it was a transition for all of us.  The state began to open-up, Washington County was one of the first.  Thank you to all our residents who got their shots, did their best and Hoedowners are back in business.
 We loved having our round dances with our Cuer Randy Lewis but we will be transitioning back to our more traditional dance schedule with squares and rounds.  We thought we could all use a brush-up so we had a Square Dance Refresher class on May 18th.  I hope you joined us.  It was so exciting seeing all the dancers on the floor SQUARE DANCING sans masks!
 It was a mighty big ask,
 To wear an approved facial mask,
 Did we want to dance?
 And not take a chance?
 And prove we were up to the task?
 
 And suddenly we’re here today,
 We now can do a twirl and sashay.
 We’re not taking a chance
 When we square up and dance.
 And we’ll give all those darn masks away.
