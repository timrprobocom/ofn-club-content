So, here it is June and masks are finally starting to come off and we are getting to see some peoples smiling faces. It does look strange to see someone with a sunburn on their forehead only.
 The CRD’s are looking forward to opening in September. We have been dark the last two summers and will remain so again this year. Hopefully, with all of the vaccinations going into dancer’s arms we will be able to resume dancing with some sort on normalcy.
 Please be safe this summer and if you are not vaccinated yet it is not too late,
