As you know by now, Single Trees started dancing May 14 with an enthusiastic group of dancers, happy to be dancing again and to see one another.  We are holding our second dance on June 25 and hope to see at least three squares of dancers come join us again and dance to Geore Hermann’s calling and Jackie Gale’s cueing.  Not everyone is vaccinated but those who are not follow the Governor’s advice to continue to wear masks and sanitize their hands between tips.  With such a large hall there is plenty of space for squares to spread out.  We have air-conditioning for those hot evenings and casual dress is fine during the summer and when temperatures are high.  At other times square dance attire is admired but not required..  At this time no food or beverages are being allowed to be shared, but we are hoping this will change once we reach the 70% vaccinated mark statewide.  We are just happy to be back dancing.  Thank you to all who love to dance and are willing to travel from out of town to dance  with us!
