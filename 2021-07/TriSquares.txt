Our monthly virtual board meeting isn't until next week, so I don't yet know if we'll have any "breaking news" to report.  But we did secure a date for our club's annual picnic, at Snyder Park in Sherwood on August 22nd.  Imagine that, a potluck picnic once again!  And with the improving pandemic situation (as of now anyway) I imagine we might even be able to have our club members doing square and round dance workshops this fall...maybe...maybe!  That's our hope.
