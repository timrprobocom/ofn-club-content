A quick note to let our dancing friends know we are here.  Busy as many of you have been clearing out those things that have accumulated over the years, our primary sorting had to do with clothing that had been donated from past dancers.   Once sorted into 1) thrift store, 2) keep for our club to gift to our guest and beginning dancers, 3) make available to dancers...somehow.  We were so fortunate to take #3 to Lac a Doâ€™s sale that very weekend.   Thank you to the 7 ladies that participated,  we accomplished a very good thing, and the storage is very tidy.
 More work is being done to the Senior Center by John Poole and Dick Sims.  Walls removed have created space for more meeting areas.
 So, while R Square D is not dancing, neither are we idle.  We are preparing, and looking forward to our future.  May you all enjoy your summer.
