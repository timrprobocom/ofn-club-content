We were able to have our first dance June 6 with our caller Tim dancing to make a full square.  We had one new dancer but were able to do more than one lesson rolled into one with 7 angels.  Everyone had a great time.  We are now dancing from 4 - 6 Sundays at the hall in Springfield with casual dress always.   Our capable caller, Tim Matteson, will adapt and call to the floor.  This was our first chance to dance since March of 2020.  Here is a link to our website. There have been changes to our website since last month. Here is the phone number of our president, David Lajoie. 541-520-7311.  Please call David or check out our website to make sure we are, indeed, dancing.  We are admitting fully vaccinated dancers at this time.  No food or drink is provided, but dancers may bring these for themselves.  We are using hand sanitizers between tips.  You are all welcome to join us.  Please bring proof of vaccination as we are keeping a signed waiver for each dancer.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.  There is a light at the end of the proverbial tunnel!

Yay to dancing again,
Christina Corelli
