Our next scheduled 5th Saturday Dance will be July 31.  We should know by then if that date is a go.  We are hoping that it is.  Protocols may certainly be different at that time as well. 

Thank you for your continued vigilance regarding the pandemic.  

Can't wait to call and cue for you,
Christina Corelli, Secretary
