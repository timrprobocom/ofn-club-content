The Oak Hills Squares currently have 7 students taking lessons. They are doing great and progressing at quite the pace. 

November 12th we will be doing a demo and introduction lesson in Lake Oswego.

We plan to visit some clubs over the holiday period and welcome any other dancers to come visit us.

We meet at the Oak Hills gym on Monday evenings. Our lessons are 6.30-7.30 and then we dance mainstream until 8.30pm.  The amazing Mark Wheeler is our caller.
