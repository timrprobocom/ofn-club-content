The club will start Tango lessons on the first Thursday in December. Randy Lewis is healing well from his September hip replacement and is looking for some new students to take the class. Look for a flyer in this issue of the OFN.

We are hosting a New Yearâ€™s Eve dance at the Salem Dance Center with Randy and David Vomocil sharing the cueing duties. It should be a good evening of various rhythms and phases of rounds. Hope you will come and join us. Look for a flyer for this dance in this issue.
