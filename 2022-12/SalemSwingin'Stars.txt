It is the official time of year to give thanks. We are grateful for all the dancers that support not only our dances, but dances throughout the state. 

It was nice to be together at the Seaside Sashay. There were 20 Stars that attended. Loads of fun.

We are sorry that we had to cancel our November 4 dance due to illness. Our November 18 Dance will be our Thankful & Grateful Dance with Randy Dibble calling and our own Sherri Milling cueing.

December 2 is our New Dancer Dance including a Resale Clothing Area, December 16 is our Christmas Dance, and December 30 is our New Year's Eve Eve Dance. Come join us as we ring in 2023 a bit early. We are getting dressed up and will toast the New Year. 

Check our Face Book page for all the latest news. Dances are posted on the Thursday prior to the dance.

See you on the dance floor. Happy Thanksgiving.
