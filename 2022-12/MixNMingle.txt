M&M’s are dark December 3rd but up and running on December 17th for our Christmas Dance with Randy and Jeanine.  At the end we’ll join hands and sing Silent Night together - always a special moment.  We may be small but we are a square dance family.  Sadly, one will be missing from our circle this year as charter member Patty Bonney has passed away just after her 92nd birthday.    We love you Cookie Patty.   You’ll always be in our hearts.
