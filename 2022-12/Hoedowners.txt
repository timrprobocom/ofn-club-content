What a transformative October it was! Weeks of warm, 80-degree weather and then BOOM, the rains returned! I guess it was mother nature telling us although we loved the lingering fall days, sometimes it’s best to get back on track which is exactly what the Hoedowners have been up to.

We had Scott Zinser calling on October 8th for our Pirate’s Booty dance. Randy Lewis is back waltzing and two stepping dancers around the dance floor and making a miraculous recovery from his surgery.

We were dark for our 2nd dance of the month so we could head west for the Seaside Sashay. It was their 20thAnniversary! That festival is always so much fun and Hoedowners don’t like missing any fun. Lots of lovely prizes, great decorations and Steve Noseck and Randy Dibble calling while Debbie Taylor was the featured cuer.  Sixteen Hoedowners dined together Saturday night at our favorite restaurant, Finn’s. Oh, and don’t forget the post party at Laas’ beach house. There was something about jalapenos and limes in a bottle?

December is just around the corner.  I hope you join us for our Dancers in Toyland dance on the 10th with Scott Zinser calling and Randy Lewis cueing. We’ll be dark on the 24th because it will be Christmas Eve!  

Hoedowners would like to send their best wishes to Ferrous Steinka who so faithfully reminds us to get our report in each month. He’s hurt his back and we’re praying for a quick recovery.
