We normally go dark for the Thanksgiving through New Years holidays as many of our members are traveling or are having relatives visiting.  Since our membership is small we need almost all of them present to have a dance.  This, in addition to our caller having January commitments, we will be dark through January, resuming on February 7th.  For up to date information see: www.wavesteppers.org. (see above link)
