Can you believe it's December?  It is hard to think that Mid Winter Festival will be here in just over a month.  I just wanted to introduce you to our Featured Callers so you can be excited to meet them in January.  

Justin Russell hails from Memphis, TN and has been calling for 18+ years. He currently is on the CALLERLAB Board of Directors and records with Royal Records.  He loves to travel and has called in 20+ states and multiple countries.  He just got back from a calling trip to Sweden and Denmark.  

Steve Edlund hails from Surrey BC and has been calling for over 35+ years. Steve currently calls for 4 clubs and is a former PNTSDF Champion.  He records with Elite Records.  Steve has also called more than 35 states and 8+ countries.  He is also a proud new grandpa to a beautiful baby girl, who we hope will be on a square dance floor in a few years.
 
These are 2 amazing callers who are going to keep the floor lively and moving.  And if you still don't know what to get that special someone for a present, never fear cause Mid Winter ribbons make a great gift that everyone will love! Look forward to seeing everyone in a Square. Have a Happy and Safe holiday!
