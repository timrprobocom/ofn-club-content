The Cherry City Cloggers are well into our beginner’s class at this point and many of our veteran cloggers have now returned. We have thirty-five active members in two different classes that clog with us every Tuesday. 

We were thrilled to have seventeen people in our Beginner Class which started on Sept 20. Since then, two have dropped out; one due to moving for the winter and the other due to personal reasons. The other fifteen are doing well. Those fifteen should be graduating just before the Christmas holidays and we look forward to many of them returning in January. 

We would like to take this opportunity to wish all the Clubs an incredibly Happy Holiday Season! Georganne Pfnister
