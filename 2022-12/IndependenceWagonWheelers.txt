The club was dark for the first Saturday of October to join other clubs in dancing at the final club dance for the Oaky Doaks. There was a carpool of members who attended, including George Hermann, our club caller, who used to be their club caller for many years, and our current President couple, Eugene & Bonnie Ivy, long time members of the club.

Our second Saturday dance was about three squares of dancers working on keeping up with the moves and music from George.  Our first November dance was at the Fairgrounds and the second Saturday dance was at the Salem Square Dance Center since the Fairgrounds was rented out.

Our new dancer dance is December 10 from 7-10 p.m. It is also our Silent Auction and Christmas dance. We hope you will come and support the many new students that are taking lessons this season. They are doing well and can use the encouragement from all of us regular dancers. There are twenty-two students in the class at IWW.
