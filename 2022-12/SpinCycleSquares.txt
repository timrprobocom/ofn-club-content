We had a very special Halloween Dance with the fabulous caller from Albuquerque, Kris Jensen , on October 30. Costumes were optional but also a lot of fun!  Kris had an authentic looking red chili pepper on her head along with her chili t-shirt.  Other dancers showed up in costume too.  Always FUN!
 
We dance every Sunday from 4 - 6 at the dance center in Springfield on Yolanda.  Tim Matteson is a great caller and will call whatever level we can muster.   We have individually wrapped snacks on hand.   We invite you all to join us!  We're a fun bunch--that's for sure! All dances are casual.

Please call our president, David Lajoie at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are, indeed, dancing.  Once in a blue moon we are dark.
