We had two dances in October, each one of which was just shy of two squares.  The last dance on Oct. 30 featured caller Kris Jensen from Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Kris is an excellent caller, and it was such a pleasure to dance to a live caller who could see what was happening on the floor and address it to keep us all dancing.  We hope she comes back this way soon.  We were happy to see Kaynor Heineck join us again after her foot operation laid her low for six months or so.  There is a group photo in the photo section of those who attended the Oct. 30 dance.

In both November and December two dances have been tentatively scheduled, on the second and fourth Sundays.  We dance from 1:30 to 3:30 in Hal B at the Emerald Square Dance Center.  Please check our schedule at cas-sq.yolasite.com but always call before driving in from out of town if you are not on the email list and donâ€™t get the word as to whether we are dancing or not.

Tea and coffee are always available and at times snacks are furnished by dancers.  We are always happy to see visitors and would love to have two squares dancing on the floor again.  As no lessons are available in our area, it is doubtful that we will see two squares again but one never knows who might move into the area.  Fingers crossed!  Call Fred Beisse at 458-221-3564 or Gaynor Hintz (541) 741-4149 for further information.

Happy dancing, everyone, and a wonderful New Year,
Gaynor Hintz
