Our lessons continued in October with 13 Mainstream students and ten for Waltz.  On two of the Sundays our new grange at Kinton was already booked up but fortunately one of our students, Greg Moravan, connected us to another venue at the Twin Oaks Air Park on River Road, only three miles west and for free!  And although we could schedule only one dance in October, it was the Halloween dance and so much fun!  Plus we visited the Hoedowners in Aloha, too.

The executive committee has decided to upgrade our December 4th lesson into a New Dancers Jamboree.  So, please join us for our "B45 Jamboree!" on Sunday the 4th, from 3:30 - 5:30, with our caller Terry Halley and cuer Sandra Pinion.  Also our two Friday dances are:  December 9th, "Rat Pack Reflections" (music of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin) and December 23rd , "Sounds of the Seasons".  We begin earlier this year:  7:00 Plus and PreRounds;  7:30 Mainstream and Rounds (with 4th tip Plus);  9:30 break at the end.  (Masks are optional -- please check our website for any masking updates.)  And of course we're having our annual Christmas party December 11th at the Royal Panda in Tualatin... Will we play that White Elephant game again?  I hope so!

Happy Holidays, everyone!
