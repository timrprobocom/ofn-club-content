Several of our members attended the Seaside Sashay last month and enjoyed the festivities over the weekend.

We continue to hold both square and round dance lessons on Sunday evenings. Our students are doing well and will graduate December 18. They will be ready to dance at Mid-Winter.

Our dances are every second and fourth Saturday of the month and all are welcome to join us. 

We River City Dancers wish you all a happy holiday season.
