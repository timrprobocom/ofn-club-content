October 1st was our 37th anniversary dance party with lasagna before the dance.  We had a nice turn out of about 6 squares and lots of people came early to enjoy dinner together.  The Seaside Sashay Square dance festival 
was held over the weekend of October 21st.  The Sunset Promenader's co-hosted the dance.   There were 220 dancers in attendance, and it was a great time.

In December we'll have a mainstream dance on December 3rd with guest caller KC Curtis and guest cuer Sherri Milling.
