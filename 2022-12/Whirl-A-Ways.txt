It's been a long two years for Whirl-A-Ways!  We are happy to be back dancing at the hall in Springfield!  We dance the second and third Saturdays. Mike Kious, our caller was in a car accident a number of weeks back and is still recuperating.  His truck was totaled. Mike was rear-ended while stopped at a light.  You just never know!  

Mike's grandpa, George Hermann, called the October 15 dance.  Mike learned how to call from George.  They are both incredibly gifted, and we are so blessed to have them both on our stage calling.  Christina's got a number of dancers up for rounds and knows people's favorite rhythm and/or dance. 
 
K.C. Curtis did our annual Veteran's Day dance November 12.  Veterans were given a free dance and a big thank you from everyone.  We are so blessed and wanted our Veterans to know that we appreciate them. 

We pray Mike is back with us for November 19. 

A number of the Whirl-A-Ways members have been attending Tuesday night square dance lessons, encouraging the newbies and brushing up on their own dancing skills.  It's amazing what we managed to “forge”' in two years.   Jake Westra is still attending lessons and doing a great job.  Learning to make mistakes is part of learning as a lot of us angels are experiencing as well!  Fun!
 
Happy dancing!
