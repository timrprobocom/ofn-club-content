In October we held our annual Halloween Dance on the 4th Friday, Oct 28 with Mark Wheeler calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  Jim Hattrick, our club caller, was unable to come down to call for us so he sent his protégée in his place.  Mark did a fine job of calling for us, and we were happy to have him with us again.  There were some fun costumes as well as elaborate ones, especially that worn by Melba Walker, a new member who danced with us some 30 years ago.  She won best costume (see photo in photo section).  We were happy to have visitors from Roseburg, Lebanon and Corvallis there.   We hope our dance on Nov.  25, the day after Thanksgiving, will see Jim Hattrick able to join us.  We will be dark in December and January because OF Christmas and Mid-Winter Festival.

Keep on dancing and please come join us if you’ll be in the area.
