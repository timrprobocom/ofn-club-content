## Keeping Your Club Healthy

Almost all of our clubs have begun dancing again. We have a new sense of what is normal. Old habits have been broken & new ones are being formed. We are all social beings, some more than others. I believe that the people who come to your dances want to socialize. Dancing is one way we can do that. It is your goal to see that it happens. All we need to do is hire exciting and interesting Callers and Cuers. That is the easy part.

We also need to administer our club, taking care of the details, establishing our goals and purpose, finding and keeping members, oh and taking care of the money to name a few. All of that is sometimes not so exciting, but it still needs to be done to keep our club healthy.

How do we make and keep our club healthy? **Communication is one of the keys.** 
Presidents, talk to your members. find out what strengths each of your members have.  Use that information to help with club activities, pairing people to tasks that they will enjoy doing and can do well. 

Do you have anyone who is great at sales? Is there someone who has good attention to detail? How about someone who is an accountant? Those people might be perfect for positions of Publicity, Secretary, and Treasurer. You also need to understand that some people may not fit any task. That is ok too.

Try to make the tasks that need to be accomplished a pleasant experience rather than a burden. We are all social beings, some more than others. Social interaction is the primary reason that we congregate to square and round dance. Part of that interaction is the praise & recognition of the people helping with the clubâ€™s administration; definitely do not forget that.

Is this a guarantee that your club will thrive and prosper? It may or may not be, but I certainly believe that it will help.

Sharing is caring.
