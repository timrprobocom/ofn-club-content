We are back to calling, cueing and teaching squares and rounds.  It's been a LONG two years, and we've all managed to get through it!  Whew!   We are finding that dances are being canceled due to the lack of dancers though.  That's disappointing, but some dancers are still gun-shy when it comes to COVID, or out of practice or have found other things to do to occur their time. We hope, in time, that dancers will once again be attending dances and classes.

 Roger Putzler is teaching square dancing Tuesday evenings.  It started with seven squares and has firmly settled into five which is not bad.  Everyone is having a great time including Jake Westra, Christina Corelli's new husband.  He was surprised how much fun it was and is sticking with it.  It is a lot of fun, and nobody knows what anybody else does for a living.  We are all there for one thing, FUN!

The Fifth Saturdays in 2023 include April 29, July 29, September 30, and December 30.  December 31 of this year is a Fifth Saturday, and Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli will be doing a Buccaneers dance so dancers can come and dance and bring it the new year when it hits Chicago, Illinois where Roger grew up.  That means we'll start Pre-Rounds at 7:30 and Squares from 8:00 - 10:00.  At 10:00 we'll bring in the new year with the fine people of Chicago.  Then we can go home and bring in the new year at midnight with family and other loved ones.  We'll miss the crazy traffic as well.  

We are continuing to stay safe with our members being vaccinated, etc.  We continue having hand sanitizers available as well and individually wrapped snacks.  Our water fountain has been turned back on, but we some opt to bring their own water.  

Welcome back to calling, cueing, teaching and dancing! Continue being safe everyone!
 
Keep on calling and cueing!
Christina Corelli
