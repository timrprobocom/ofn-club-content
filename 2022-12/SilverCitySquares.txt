We have had a busy fall season. We have both mainstream and 2-step lessons going on. Mainstream has an average of forty students at class each week and eight or nine squares on the floor. 2-step has about fifteen students.

In October, the club pitched in and helped Waldo Hills Community Club with a clean-up/workday. Dusting, sweeping, mowing, and taking care of some downed branches. A lot of hands make it go faster.

Our ham dinner dance this year was a lot of fun. A good dinner and lots of fun dancing to Ian Craig and Julia Buchheit. Ian Craig and Julie Stiers did an excellent job at our Saturday dance in November.

Look for our flyer for our New Year's Eve dance! This will be a regular dance up until 10:00 pm, then it turns into an overnight party for the youth!
