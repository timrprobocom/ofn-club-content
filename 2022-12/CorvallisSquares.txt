Fall lessons are going well for the first Corvallis Squares class in a few years! Taught at the SSD level by wonderful Sandy Harris, the students are hoping to attend some of the new dancers' dances to hone their skills.

We had two dances in October, including our Halloween dance, where some super creative costumes were featured! We were dark in November, but we are planning a holiday dance the second Saturday of December with Craig Abercrombie calling and cueing. It will be a treat to gather again. Happy Holidays to all!
