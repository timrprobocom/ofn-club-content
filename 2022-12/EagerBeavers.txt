We were very happy to welcome Jim Hattrick back on stage in October, calling three dances including our Halloween Dance on the 31st.  Several of our members attended the Seaside Sashay, where they experienced the joy of having a large number of squares on the dance floor.

Take a break from your holiday preparations by joining us in December when we will have Jim Hattrick calling and cueing on the 5th and 19th, and Darrell Kalmbach calling with Jeanine Norden cueing on the 12th.  Our scheduled dance on the 26th has been cancelled due to proximity to Christmas.  

We dance Plus with Phase II and III Rounds every Monday afternoon from 1:00 to 3:00, including holidays.  Most of our dancers are vaccinated.  If you are not feeling well,  please join us when you are better.  For current information, please see our website at http://EagerBeavers.info. (see link above)
