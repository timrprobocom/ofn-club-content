Our recent Octoberfest was well attended and great fun for all. Craig Abercrombie, Adam Christman and Susan Healea were top-notch, as always, and the dancers thoroughly enjoyed their time at Catlin Grange. The German dinner was delicious and we were entertained by River City Riders just before the Saturday evening dance.  Many thanks to all who helped make this a fun festival, including those who traveled quite a distance to support us. Ursula was even spotted helping with cleanup in the kitchen Saturday night!

R Square D has only one dance in December and thatâ€™s our annual Toy Dance on Friday, December 9th, at Kelso Senior Center. Craig Abercrombie is calling and Susan Healea is cueing the dance.  New, unwrapped toys will be accepted and later donated to our local Salvation Army.  We will be dark on December 24th.

Our plus and mainstream classes are expected to wrap up on December 14th and the club will soon make a decision about starting new lessons in January.

After a two-year absence, we will have a club Christmas party on Monday, December 12th, with a pot luck and gift exchange. This always promises to be great fun!

We wish everyone a blessed, safe Christmas and Happy New Year!
