The Ramblers dance at the Milwaukie Grange on the first Saturday of each month. On February 7, we hosted Palm Springs caller Terri Sherrer. On March 7, we hosted Albuquerque caller Kris Jensen. We will be dancing on April 4; caller TBD. We look forward to welcoming back Chuck Garner, who taught our Mainstream class for several years, to call for our Mainstream graduation dance on May 2. We also plan to dance on June 6; we will be dark on July 4. Solos, couples, and families are all welcome at our monthly dances. We encourage visitations from other clubs.

We’ve just confirmed the dates for our club’s annual three-day dance festival, which we call Scares and Squares because it takes place around Halloween. We will be dancing October 23-25, 2015 at the Multnomah Arts Center, 7688 SW Capitol Highway, Portland. Callers will include Mike DeSisto (Enumclaw, WA) and Chris Phillips (Ft. Lauderdale, FL). This is a great opportunity to dance to different calling styles and diverse musical selections with some superb callers. Solos, couples, and families are welcome.
