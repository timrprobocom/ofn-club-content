Nothing as sweet as the sounds of feet tapping, and laughter in anticipation of what kind of fun is about to happen when the caller steps up to the microphone.  February brought the club out in lots of red and pink for sweetheart’s day with a dance on the 13th. We continue the month with our benefit dance for the Emergency Shelter on the February 28th.  
We had a busy month of visitations starting with 5 couples going to Buzzin Bees to retrieve a banner and on the 21st the club made a good showing at the Anniversary dance at Ruff and Ruffles in Kelso.  Congratulations to them.  In turn we will celebrate our 62nd Anniversary dance on April 10th followed up by a Western dance with guest caller Renee Rudd on April 25th. 
We’ve had amazing support from the club on lesson nights and most of the time the floor is moving with 3 squares.  Thank you to Vic Roberts and Toni Carroll for hosting the monthly meeting.
