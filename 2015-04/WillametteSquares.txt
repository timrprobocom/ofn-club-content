     February was the Willamette Squares' sweetheart dance and there was a good turnout of visitors from various clubs. The caller was Sandy Harris, and the cuer was Sandra Pinion. 
     We are glad to report that member Brice Baker is recovering from recent surgery. Get well soon, Brice.
     We are looking forward to our March dance. No matter how big or small, our dances are always FUN so we hope you will join us for an enjoyable evening of dancing and friendship!  Jodee Howard
