The last couple of months, I wrote about clubs in trouble and when it may be wise to merge with other clubs.  I wrote about clubs who cannot consistently get an average of four squares per dance night.  But another symptom of a club in trouble is not being able to get anyone to serve on its board of directors.  Of course, this is no problem for caller run clubs, but is a problem for a federated club.  An advantage about merging is that talent that can be pooled: one set of officers would be needed rather than two sets.

Many things change.  Back in the day, the square dancer norm was to sell the family home, buy an RV, and travel the country going to regional and national square dances.  For a variety of reasons (mostly having to do with HMO plans and the cost of running an RV), that was not practical.  But you can still have a lot of dance fun locally, but only if there is proper staffing for these events.
