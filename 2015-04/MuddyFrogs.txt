The Milton-Freewater Muddy Frogs waltz social ballroom classes drew a crowd of two dozen dancers having a good time one-two-threeing around the hall, under the instruction of Neva Reid.  On April 12, a six-week session of jive/swing social ballroom classes will commence from 3:45-5:00.

The square dance class has entered the final weeks of classes under the able calling of Bill Reid, ending with graduation at our April 19 dance.

The Frogs will have their regular third Sunday afternoon dance on April 19 from 3:00-5:00, with a potluck following.  Our own Bill and Neva Reid will be calling and cueing at our regular hall, the Community Building at 109 NW 5thin Milton-Freewater.

We are a lively group who love to laugh and would love to have you join our fun!

Keep on dancin’!
