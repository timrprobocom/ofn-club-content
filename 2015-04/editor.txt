We are finally ready to accept non-Federation advertising in the online OFN, for $10 
per month.  Send a full-page PDF to your editor at the link below,
and send your check to the Federation treasurer, currently Marilyn Schmit.

The Available Caller and Cuer listings will be $12 per year, as before.

We have an article this month with an interesting fun activity for your next dance,
by having a "bingo" game for door prizes.  New numbers get called after each tip
until someone gets a "bingo".
