     The club is going through some changes as our cuer, Ray Walz and his wife, Virginia, are retiring from active cueing due to medical reasons. They will stay with us for a short time while we look for a replacement to teach and cue Phase 3-4 lessons and dances. They put their house up for sale on a Friday and had an offer on the following Tuesday and are in the midst of moving out and putting things in storage until they find a smaller house closer to their son in Keizer.
     We have finished West Coast Swing and are now working on dances and then work-shopping a step in the dance if we mess up. Not sure what our hours are going to be until we hire a new cuer and set up a schedule that will work for them. We have interviewed one potential candidate and will make a decision in the near future in case we hear from someone else who might be interested. You can call President Marilyn Schmit at 503-508-0539 to see what we are doing each week until a new schedule is set. Marilyn Schmit
