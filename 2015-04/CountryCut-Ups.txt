Spring has sprung and new life is showing up all over! New dancers are learning their moves and getting ready to graduate into full fledged mainstream square dancers by summer. Old dancers will need to learn new names as they join our club.

Speaking of spring, we hope all of you reading this, and many more, will come out to the annual Barn Sale. This year you can find some of yesterday’s treasures on sale on April 10 and 11, 2015. We are sure you need something that we can sell you! The proceeds of this sale help us with out beloved old Boring Barn’s upkeep and repairs.

Elections were held March 8, 2015 and we are pleased that most of our officers were willing to keep serving. Doug and Kathie Femrite stepped into the president’s position in January to fill a vacancy and have agreed to serve for the coming year. Tom and Katie Cassatt and Donna Krossman-Darling will continue as our vice presidents. Dan and Debbi Ragland will continue as treasurer. Incoming officers, Josh and Crystal Thomas will now fill the secretary slot. A big thanks to all who are willing to serve and a special thanks to all the members who have served on the board in the past.
