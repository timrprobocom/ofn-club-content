     Special thanks to all who joined us on Valentine's Day for our Birthday Dance! Later that month, we had a festive graduation party for our eleven graduates from our mainstream class. Two of our members, Bob and Luella, supplied freshly cut daffodils for all the grads. Some of these new club members, along with others, headed west for our annual coast trip at Gleneden Beach in March. In April, we look forward to more dancing and are encouraging new dancers to get their "floor time" in!  Karen
