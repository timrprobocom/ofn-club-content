 It's always a treat when we have KRIS JENSEN,national caller from Albuquerque, New Mexico to call for us.  Kris is Kurt Jensen's sister.  Kurt and his wife, Lorna, are members of Spin Cycle Squares and round dancers with Christina and Kirby.  Tim Matteson got to have a night off from calling and enjoyed dancing to Kris.  Kris also called advanced for Cast-a-Shadow earlier.
    We encourage dancers from all levels to attend our Sunday evening sessions which begin at 5:30.  Tim calls and teaches all levels.  This is a great chance to give yourself floor time and have FUN!
 
Happy dancing!
Christina Corelli
