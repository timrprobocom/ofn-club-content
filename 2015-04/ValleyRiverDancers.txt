The past few months have been busy! Following great turnout for Mid-Winter Festival, we rallied the troops to win the Mid-Willamette Council Trophy Dance in February followed closely by a fantastic anniversary dance. Our trophy dance will be May 22, for those of you who plan ahead. Our caller, Randy Dibble, and cuer, Julie Stiers, promise to keep guests on their toes.

While you have your calendar out, add Valley River Dancers’ wildly popular “Dancing Under the Stars” dance which will be held on Friday, July 24, during the Newberg Old Fashioned Festival. Watch for our flyer in a future edition of the OFN.

Mainstream and advanced students are deep into lessons and having a blast. Randy teaches every Tuesday, with mainstream at 6:30 and advanced at 8:00. Drop-ins are welcome, and our lessons and dances are still just $5.00 a person.
