      Braids and Braves graduated four new dancers at our January dance, with several more new dancers that could not attend the graduation. One of our new dancers, Lynnette Wiesner, was awarded an Ambassador Badge for her attendance at new dancer dances. Congratulations, Lynnette! We are pleased to have all of our new dancers dancing with us. We also began a Plus level class in January with two squares of dancers and Leonard Snodgrass teaching. We are having lots of fun and learning too!
     At our February business meeting, the club decided to ask our visiting callers and cuers to contribute the regular admission price at our dances. We are also busy planning our demos and visits for spring and summer: a demo at Willow Place in Newberg on March 28, Farm Fest on April 11 and Harvest Fest on August 15-16, both at Yamhill Valley Heritage Center in McMinnville. Club members are looking forward to another summer camp-out at Flying M Ranch in the hills outside of Yamhill August 28-30. Looks like a fun spring and summer!  Jennie
