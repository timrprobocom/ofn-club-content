What a lovely month of dancing we had in February.  Not only did we have a “hearty” lot of fun at our Valentines Dance, but we also celebrated the graduation of 17 new students at our combo potluck & graduation night.  Chuck Simpkins led the graduates through a tip danced to the Chicken Dance while the students wore chicken tail feathers and yellow beaks.  Before receiving their diplomas the students also danced a tip with a balloon between their knees.  We also had a few additional folks who came out for lessons and received their Refresher Workshop certificates.  Thanks to a small group of hard working volunteers our annual February Barn Sale was a success.   We are looking forward to our 63rd Birthday Dance coming up April 4th.  Our fabulous local Umpqua Valley Boys will be calling and Neil Koozer will be cueing.  Birthday cake is on the “agenda” so mark it down on your calendar and join us!
