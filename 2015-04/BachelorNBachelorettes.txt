I love dancing, especially with the B&B’s.  So, to get to our dances, I drive with a heavy foot on the gas and a hand on the horn.  I mean, there’s more to life than dancing, but not much more.  And I want big bang for my buck.  I don’t like to sit out, which is why I take as many of our lessons as possible, so that no matter what is called or cued, I can dance it. That goes for the cha lessons we are starting this month, before our Wednesday dances.

Dances this month, where you can particularly get big bang for your buck, are our “Early Days” dance on April 1st.  No foolin’ this will be a pretty sentimental dance, designed to bring up great memories, especially when dancing was the pastime norm.  You can bring pictures of your early childhood.  You should see me in my cute pigtails and flouncy white dress.

And then our big 50th Aniversary gala on April 15th, with National Caller DAN NORDBYE from Gilbert, Arizona.  Our club got started because solo dancers were not necessarily welcomed at many clubs.  But we showed ‘em; and now we’re tootin’ our horn!
