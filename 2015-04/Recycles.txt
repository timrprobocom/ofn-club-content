It's April Showers time of the year---but at the Recycles' dance on Friday the 10th, you'll be showered with lots of Fun and Good Times instead of rain!  Scott always calls a lively dance and tosses in some twists 'n' turns on the usual, and Jeanine is sure to treat us to many levels of enjoyable Rounds.  Bring your "A" dancing friends along with you, and we'll even have an "A" tip at the end of the evening.  Something for everyone!

Many thanks to all of our faithful guests who make our dances possible!  We've had an excellent turnout the past couple of months and truly appreciate our loyal supporters coming out to Plus dance with us.  As long as our tiny club continues to have lots of guests, it looks like the Recycles will still be around for everyone to enjoy for quite a while! 

See you soon---
