We experienced the skinniest attendance ever at our club anniversary dance, the “Flintstone” dance on February 20th.  Our lesson learned is not to host the Trophy dance, ahead of another major theme dance – and certainly not back-to-back.  The logic being:  it takes energy to do a visitation, if a club has just been to your hall, it is not likely that visit will repeat with your next dance, and thus low attendance the result.  So trophy/banner winners…choose wisely your Trophy dance date.  We were thankful for those who attended our “Flintstone” dance - you made it fun!   Costume prizes were awarded to these dancers:   Adult Male/Female was Les Seeley and Vicki Pounds (C&P), Youth Male/Female:  Ethan and Madison (C&P), and the winning couple was Robert and Young (Country Cut-ups).
 
The Chaps & Petticoats enjoyed the Silverton dance demonstration on March 8th where the Silver Knights and Silver Dragons exhibited their styling to be seen at the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance competition.  Chaps had six dancers present at the Silver City Squares fundraiser to wish our youth “good luck”!  
 
 Won’t you wear your Easter hat/bonnet and come support Scott Zinser and Jackie Gale, caller/cuer on our April 3rd dance?  April 17th is a regular dance with Leonard Snodgrass and Ken Pratt as caller/cue – please join us.  
 
Happy Feet,
