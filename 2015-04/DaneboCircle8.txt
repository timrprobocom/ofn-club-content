   We celebrated our birthday March 7 -  65 years!  We are the second oldest club in Oregon.  Ivan Midlam was the first caller/teacher.  The club first met in Sadie Bertlesen's kitchen in the Danebo (pronounced Dane' uh Bo) area of Eugene.  Five couples from Danebo Circle 8 bought Prairie Hall in west Eugene where we danced for many years.  We now dance at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield. 
    We will again host DAN NORDBYE, national caller from Mesa, Arizona April 14, 2015.  The dance will begin at 7:30 with squares and go until 9:30.  We have had people comment that beginning and ending earlier would be beneficial to those having to go to work the following day.  So, no excuses, we'll see you April 14 for DAN NORDBYE.  This is a Tuesday and will be at the Emerald Dancer Center in Springfield.
    We are enjoying Wednesday night beginner square dance lessons with up to ten squares dancing!  We have angels from all of the area clubs and encourage you to attend.  The beginners are having a great time as are the angels and Jim Voll, our instructor. 
 
Keep on dancin!
