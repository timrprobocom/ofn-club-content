The youth have been working hard on practicing and fundraising. Thank you to everyone who came to their fundraiser dance on March 8. We currently have 21 youth planning to go to the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance competition in May. This gives us two teams of squares, two callers and two couples in round dancing. 
     We added something new to the fundraising this year. One of our parents has had some experience with the “GoFundMe” system and volunteered to set one up for us. If you are interested in checking it out, please go to gofundme.com/mv2274. 
     For our superstition dance on March 13, we had a lot of fun researching superstitions and decorating the hall. See you in a square soon. Thomas Buchheit
