If this report comes out early and before the end of March, please plan to attend the fund raiser for our hall, Milwaukie Community Club,  on Sunday, March 29.  World reknown story-teller Eric Foxman will be entertaining from 3:30-5:00 PM.  This performance will have an Easter theme.  Suggested donation is $12.50 per person.  Hope to see you there.

Our mystery trip is this month, April 25.  Maybe we will be coming to dance with you, and, then, again, maybe not.  Frank and Cathy Betzer are sure to plan an exciting evening.

 Our April 18th dance is a Hobo Dance and Canned Food Drive.  Come in your comfortable duds.  We decided to have our food drive in the spring as there is a need year found, not just during the holidays.
