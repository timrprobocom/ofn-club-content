Wow, we have been having a great time of dancing at our new location. Seems like the attendance has been up which I attribute to having better parking and a larger dance floor and, of course, a great caller and cuer (wink). 
     Our Chinese New Year dance was a big success with three tables of auction items and some great Chinese food and fun dancing. 
     We have several dances with fun themes coming up, so come join us. We always have a good time. Sandy
