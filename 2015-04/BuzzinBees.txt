Happy spring from the Buzzin Bees.  February was fun with our sweetheart dance and a mystery trip where we ate at a Vietnamese restaurant  (New experience for some of us ) and danced to Chuck Garner with the Valley Squares. We just had our Pie Eating contest and dance where we had a visitation from River City Dancers. For the second year in a row, the winner is ...Marvin Shaw from the River City dancers. We danced to our guest caller, Mike Combs. I just love the Irish songs he does.

Our next big dance is our anniversary dance. We will be celebrating 57 years as a square dance club on April 18th. Please join us. We have elections coming at our dance on 4/4. See you in a square.
