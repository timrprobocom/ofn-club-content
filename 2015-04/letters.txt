<li> <a>Beach Bingo Dance</a>
<div>
<p>
Bingo cards can be issued at the door. Give out one card for every
dancer. Have the dancers put their name on the back of the card just in
case it gets misplaced.
<p>
The bingo cards come in a Bingo game purchased at any toy store or even
Fred Meyers.  Purchase the cheapest one possible because you will only
be using the cards. Place the cards on a copier. You should be able to
get 4 cards per sheet of paper. Copy all the cards and then cut the
copied cards out. These will be the ones you give out at the door.
Keep the original cards to be used for future dances.
<p>
On the back of the cards you will need to attach a strip of transparent
dots using Elmer's glue. The transparent dots come in rolls and are made
by Avery. They can be picked up at any stationary store. Use only the
transparent dots. They are available in Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow. Do
Not Use the Yellow. Cut out strips of 15 dots and attach them to the
back of the cards.
<p>
Have a Called Number Board set up on stage. This can be a large sheet of
paper or a dry eraser board. On the top of the board print out the word
BINGO. Under the "B" put the numbers 1 - 15 in a column. Under the "I"
put the numbers 16 - 30 in a column. Under the "N" put the numbers 31 -
45 in a column. Under the "G" put the numbers 46 - 60 in a column. Under
the "O" put the numbers 61 -75. As the numbers are called, circle the
number with a marker.
<p>
After each tip choose 1 person in each square to give a number. This
can be the #1 gal in each square, or #4 guy in each square, or whoever
the MC chooses. You will need a minimum of 5 numbers. If you have
less than 5 squares, choose another person in each square to give a
number. Individuals who are chosen to pick a number can pick any number
they want, even if it is a number on their card. After a number is chosen,
the number is circled on the Called Number Board. All individuals that
have the called numbers will place a transparent dot over the number on
their card.
<p>
Choosing numbers will continue after each tip until BINGO is called. At
that time the numbers will be checked and the winner will choose from
the door prizes. Play will continue on the same cards until a second
BINGO is called and so on until all the door prizes are awarded.
<p>
It is best to keep the number of door prizes down; otherwise it might go on for a long time.
