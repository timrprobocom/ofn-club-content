  Please join us for our 66th Anniversary Dance April 18, Chuck Garner calling and Connie Clark cueing.  
 We hosted our annual Soup Dance to celebrate the Super Bowl.  Guests sampled lentil, beef barley, lemon chicken, French onion, and taco soups.  We had so many fine guest callers and cuers to accompany our own creative artists, Chuck and Connie.  Daryl Clendenin, Darrell Kalmbach, KC Curtis, George Clark shared the calling mike and Julie Stiers, Bev Hardin, Yvonne Clendenin the cueing honors.
 Our Mardi Gras Dance was humming with a visitation from Buzzing Bees.  Colorful beads clacked as dancers twirled and a few folks hid their faces behind masks of various hues.  A couple of toucans alit in the form of Julie and Pete Cooper.  Dancers sampled King Cake during our Open Break in the Quilt Room.
 We ended the month with a visit to Hoedowners' 65 Anniversary Dance.  What a nice crowd of celebrants from the dancing community!  We recaptured one of our club flags.
