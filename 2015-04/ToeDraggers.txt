 KC Curtis, Bev and Harlan Flint, set their alarms early to arrive before sunrise on Feb. 20th, to dance, call and cue, as Channel 2 News filmed the dancing live, for the early news.  Folks are working hard to advertise square and round dancing in our area.  Thanks to everyone who participated.
 In February our Italian Spaghetti feed and chocolate desserts were a great hit.  We had to dance hard to work off those calories.  March found us dancing with the Leprechauns.  We also found our Pots of Gold hidden in the Irish rubber ducks on our second dance of the month. Those silly rubber ducks left us with smiles and lots of special fun memories.  When was the last time you visited the Scandinavian countries?  April is our month to do that and also celebrate the Arrival of Spring with our travels. Please remember our second dance in April is being held at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro. 
 We want to send get well wishes to Janelle Janicke, Kathy Degman and Debra Wold who have been working hard on healing their bodies so they can get back to dancing with the Toes.
