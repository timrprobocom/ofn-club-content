February was a fun month for the Single Trees.  On Feb. 13 we celebrated our 51st birthday with four squares of enthusiastic dancers on the floor, enjoying the calling of the Wild Cards and cueing of Jackie Gale.  What a great time we had with visitors from as far away as the Happy Hoppers in Vancouver and Roseburg Timber 8's and Buckeroos, all wanting to see this fun group of callers.  They  got rave reviews from everyone for being so friendly.  Everyone enjoyed themselves and the birthday cake and ice cream served at break time.

The next weekend some of us went to the Danebo Circle 8 dance with Lennie Ludiker and Christina Corelli.  It was their Chinese New Year dance with contributions of decorations from the Boots and Sandals who were there too to enjoy this special dance.  Lennie did a great job and looked so cool in his Mandarin outfit and long braid and cap.

Craig Abercrombie called and cued for us on the 27th and as always had us dancing to the beat of his well chosen music.  We always like his singing and his songs too.  He'll be calling for us once again and next September will bring his friend Al Frazier with him.  We had our club elections the night of the 27th.   Unfortunately we found no one willing to run for president so our new vice president, Joy Pitts, will be stepping up to manage both positions.  We hope the club will pull together to support her efforts.

We’re all looking forward to our Spring Bonnet dance in April with Jim Voll and Jackie Gale.  We are happy now that we can have Jim guest call now and then for us once again and tickled pink that Jackie will be our club cuer starting in September.
