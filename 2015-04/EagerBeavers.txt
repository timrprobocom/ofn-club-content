 Eager Beavers visited the Valley Squares on February 7th with a square and our caller.  We have two banners now so if you would like your banners back come to any Monday dance or our Anniversary Mainstream Dance on Sunday afternoon, April 26th, at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro.  See flyer for info in the OFN Flyers section.
 February 9th we held our Valentine Dance honoring our randomly selected King and Queen.  We were delighted to see Nan Overall and Dick Frazier selected to cheers from the dancers.  They also received flowers and candy.  Good job when you can get it!
 If tax time is getting you down come dance at our Poor Man’s Ball April 13th.  By that time you should know if you are a pauper or flush with cash and you can show it off by what you wear.  Anyone wearing a barrel?
 The Eager Beavers started plus lessons for new dancers and old dancers who wanted some practice.  We expect to be adding new members soon. 
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00-3:15 p.m. (rounds from 1 to 1:30) at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW  Cornell Road in Beaverton.  Please check for up to date information at www.eagerbeavers.info.
