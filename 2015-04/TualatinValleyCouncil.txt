The next Council event will be a fifth Saturday dance at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro on May 30th.  The scheduled caller is Jim Hattrick and due to health issues, he probably will not be able to do the dance.  The Council Caller Advisor, Daryl Clendenin, is working to resolve this, perhaps getting a group of cuers and callers to volunteer to do the dance.
