It’s April and three of our favorite annual events are with us again!  What are they?  Our First Saturday Dance (April 4) is our ‘Easter Gospel Dance” with all singing calls.  (The format of the evening will remain the same with Intermediate rounds from 7:00-7:30, Pre- rounds from 7:30-7:50 and a mini-Plus teach from 7:50-8:00 and then it is Mainstream until 11:00  with our usual potluck break at 9:30 pm).  

Our New Dancer Jamboree with Clothing Resale will be Thursday, April 9 from 7:30 – 9:30 pm.  All new dancers and angels are warmly welcomed.  It’s a chance for our new dancers to try on their ‘dancing feet’ at their first dance!  
The third weekend we are dark.  We’re off to the beach!  Which one you ask? Well, to Lincoln City for their mile long garage sale, some dancing and some friendly fun.  You are most welcome to join us for the day or for the whole weekend (Friday evening to Sunday morning).

And May 2nd is the Oaky Doaks 55th Anniversary Dance!  That is a lot of years of dancing!  Scott Coon, Elvis Tribute Artist and Square Dance Caller from Seattle, will join cuer, Helen Halley, to help us celebrate this big anniversary.  Elvis’ film “Fun in Acapulco” is the inspiration for the evening.  An Elvis Tribute floor show will start off the festivities at 4:30 pm. Feel free to invite your non-dancer friends to join you for the afternoon show!  Then we’ll host a Cinco de Mayo potluck and our regular dance format for the evening.  (Limited Tickets are now on sale:  $7 for either the floor show or the dance or save at $10 for both.)  We’re looking forward to lots of fun dancing with ‘Elvis’!
