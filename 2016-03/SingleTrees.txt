Single Trees had forty-six people attending our December 8th dance and thirty-three on the 22nd.  Christmas was good.  New Year's was good.  Members attended MidWinter.  At our Board Meeting in February it was decided we must update our sign in the window at Emerald Square and Round Dance Center; long overdue.  We are making plans for upcoming dances; themes, etc.
