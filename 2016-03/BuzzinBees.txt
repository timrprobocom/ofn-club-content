Greetings from the Buzzing Bees. Wow! March already. I am really ready for spring. It has been a long, wet winter. I am writing this the week after Oregon's mid winter festival where we joined the Toe Draggers for our Saturday night meal. We share a caller now so we have an extra bond.

March brings two dances - our workshop dance on 3/5 and our Honor the Irish dance on 3 / 19. I have been pleased with our workshop dances because we can identify moves we have difficulty with in both square dancing and round dancing and then have the opportunity to work on them so it makes things easier and smoother. It has been rather fun. Our Irish dance is always fun because we usually have a guest caller - Mike Holmes and we always have Irish Sundaes for break. Yum. If you don't know what an Irish Sunday is, come to the dance To honor the wearing of the green and find out. See you in a square!
