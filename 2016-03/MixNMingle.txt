Our second January dance was exceptionally lively and fun because several dancers from Valley River Dancers joined us for an evening of Randy Dibble's calling.  We look forward to their next dance with us.  Unfortunately, Jeanine Norden's throat prevented her from cuing for us.  Dennis Smith came to the rescue.  Like Jeanine and husband Paul, Dennis is always ready to help fill a square.  If you ever want to check if there has been a last minute change, go to our website for the latest news.
