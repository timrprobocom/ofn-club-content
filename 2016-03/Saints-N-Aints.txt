Our round dance class seems to be going well with Donna teaching waltz.

Several area dancers attended the party for Billie Smith in Port Orford.  She was given the Randall Award at Mid-Winter.  Congratulations, Billie, for a well-deserved honor!

Our third Saturday March dance will have a St. Patrickâ€™s theme this year.

That is about it for this month.
