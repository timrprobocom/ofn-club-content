National caller Jon Jones wrote an article in <i>American Square Dance</i>
magazine in January 2002 entitled "Where Have All The Dancers Gone?" in 
which he discusses his assessment as a national caller of the reasons
behind the decline in square dancing.  He has given us permission to
<a href="/content/2016-03/Where Have All The Dancers Gone.pdf">reprint the article here,</a>
and it is well worth your time to read it.
