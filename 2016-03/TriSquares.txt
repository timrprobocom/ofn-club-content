On February 6th, the Tri Squares had a “Share Your Heart Dance”. This dance was a special time emphasizing the season of love. The Tigard Grange was filled with beautiful shades of red and pink.  This dance was special. Two members shared that they were celebrating 50 years together.  The night was filled with love and fun.

The Tri Squares are looking forward to our upcoming dances in March we will be having two dances. Terry Halley will be calling and Sandra Pinion will be cueing. Our first dance is the first Saturday on the 5th. The theme for the dance is “Orient Express”. Our second dance for the month is on the third Friday on the 18th. The theme for this dance is "Bit o' the Irish". We look forward to dancing with all of our friends. See you in a square.
