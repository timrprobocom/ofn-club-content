January was a busy month! We have a new year and are nurturing our new dancers. We had a good dance thanks to Leonard and Sandra, our great caller and cuer. Some members visited the Corvallis Squares dance and 12 attended Mid-Winter Festival in Albany. What a wonderful time that was! We already have our ribbons for next year and we'll have two featured callers then.
      Our club gained seven new members when we held graduation at our February dance. 
     Please note that our club is selling our dance trailer and we are offering it to square dance clubs first. More details will be available soon.  Also, we voted to go dark for the months of June, July and August this year. We will be doing a lot of visiting during that time so watch for us! Carmen Rost
