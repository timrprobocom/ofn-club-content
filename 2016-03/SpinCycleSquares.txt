Spin Cycle Squares
    
 We look forward to having Kris Jensen, national caller from Albuquerque, back with us in March.  Kris's brother, Kurt and his wife, Lorna, are members of Spin Cycle Squares.
 
Spin Cycle Squares is sponsoring Dan Nordbye, national caller from Mesa, Arizona on April 12, a Tuesday.  Pre-Rounds at 7:30 will be cued by Christina Corelli.  The mainstream dance with plus tips will run from 8:00 - 10-:30 with Dan.  Please plan on joining us for this special dance.
 
We continue to dance all levels from 5:30 - 8:00 most Sundays in Hall A at the hall in Sprngfield.  We encourage you to join us.  Please call Tim at 541-988-0399 or our president, David at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are dancing.  We rarely go dark, but you never know. 
 
Our hall has a cushioned wood floor for your dancing ease and pleasure.
 
Happy dancing!
Christina Corelli
