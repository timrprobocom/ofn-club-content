Now that we have been approved by the State Federation for hosting the 2017 Summer Festival, plans are being made. We have selected a site and are now working on the other details. We will keep all the state clubs informed with our progress as soon as we make more decisions. 

     A GREAT BIG THANK YOU to the Mid-Winter Festival Committee and all the volunteers who made the Festival a tremendous success! We know it took a lot of time and hard work and we appreciate all your efforts!
