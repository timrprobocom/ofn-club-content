It’s been a busy two months for the Toe Draggers, as we’ve ushered in 2016.   We finished our mainstream lessons with graduation on January 27th, celebrating with our new dancing friends.  KC and Linda did a great job.  Thanks to you both.

Bev and Harlan Flint started round dance lessons in mid-January.  They will follow up with waltz lessons before they are done.  They sure do make our time together fun.

Hope you had a chance to attend Mid-Winter.  Organizers worked so hard to give us a great weekend.  The Toes gathered for dinner together in Albany on Saturday late afternoon and were back out on the dance floor to continue their weekend of dance and meeting with old and new friends.  Great fun had by all.

Our Sadie Hawkins Dance was full of great costumes, funny jokes, a yummy southern style dinner, and lots of great dancing.  How this group has fun together on the dance floor!  We shared the love!!!!

We're hoping you wear your green for our March 4th "Luck of the 4 Sided Square Dance".  We're celebrating St. Patrick’s Day a little early, but I’m sure the leprechauns won't mind.  We will follow up on March 18th with our famous Ducky Dance in honor of Tom Gray, and his special collection of world renowned ducks.  You might want to wear yellow with a duck bill and feathers, but it’s not required.

Looking forward to Spring and filling up our calendars with dance events.  See you in a square.
