We had a wonderful turnout for our New Dancers/Baked Potato Dinner Dance in January. Thank you to everyone who came. Attendees were able to enjoy a great dance with Leonard Snodgrass and Frances Herigstad.

       We graduated five students just before Mid-Winter and all of them joined the club. Three of them also attended Mid-Winter. The Silver Dragons & Silver Knights did a demo at Mid-Winter on Friday evening. We hope you were able to watch the kids. 

      We have about two squares going to Canada for the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival in May. We are about halfway to our fundraising goal for the year. We are still selling festival pins and our raffle tickets. We have our Fundraising Dance on Sunday March 6 and we will draw our raffle winners there. We will also have a silent auction and will do a demo during the afternoon. Please check out our flyer and we hope to see you there. Petrina Buchheit
