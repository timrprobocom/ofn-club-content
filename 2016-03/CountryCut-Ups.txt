Mid-Winter Festival saw a great showing of the Cut-Ups. We got together on Saturday evening for a Chinese dinner to take a break from the dancing. Those staying at the Phoenix Inn enjoyed some fun time together. It was great to also see so many youth at the festival!

      Spring is time for the Country Cut-Ups to clean out their closets, attics, basements, or where ever those unused items are lurking. The Annual Barn Sale is coming up in April! Be sure to ask your friends and neighbors for donations, then invite to come shopping. This is one of major fundraisers to support the Barn overhead. March also brings our election of officers. Consider whether it is time to step up and serve the club in a new way.  We can all find ways to support this great organization and keep our favorite past time going. 

       We are having a mainstream class taught by Scott Zinser. The students are excited and eager to learn. The angels are doing a great job of showing up to support them. Keep up the good work. Anyone wanting to brush up on their dance skills can come join us at the Boring Barn 7:30 to 9:30 every Thursday evening.
