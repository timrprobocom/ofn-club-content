January was a big month for the Lebanon Square Circlers with our 67th Birthday Dance on the 17th of the month. We had a great time with lots of dancers, Charlotte Jeskey and Jim Voll calling and Jackie Gale cueing, and strawberry shortcake being served.
 
      Many of our club members attended the Mid Winter Festival in Albany. The club had a dinner together on Saturday Night at Pop's Branding Iron. 

      A slate of officers has been nominated and elected for the next year. See you in a square! Marilyn York
