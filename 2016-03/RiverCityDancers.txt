A very long time ago, I remember how I used to dread January.  Everybody knows the routine:  dreary gray dripping skies; ice and other freezing unpleasantness; Christmas bills; nothing to look forward to until spring, or so it seemed.  That was before my husband Leonard and I discovered Square Dancing, somewhere around 1965, and then, best of all, Winter Festival during the last weekend of January.

It’s a fabulous event.  In those days, it was held in Eugene.  For us Portland area people, when it was moved to Albany, it was so much closer.  I commend those folks who put it together, starting, really, the year before the year before, at least.  We know how much work is involved in “simple” for once every now and then festivals, but to do it over and over again!  Thank you for your work. 

River City Dancers had thirty-five attending this year.  We had our usual group photo taken by Jolene Cummings again.  Thanks, Jolene and Ed for doing that for us.  It’s a special challenge to get that many people together in one place at the same time.  And thanks, Al Wolf, for your help in coordinating us.

I don’t have any official figures, but it was my impression that attendance was lower this year.  But speaking of impressions, Rocky and I were hugely pleased with what I thought were a much larger group of newer, younger dancers, who were so lively and fun.

See you next festival!
