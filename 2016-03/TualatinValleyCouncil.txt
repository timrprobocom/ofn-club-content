Each year the Tualatin Valley Council holds a Presidents Appreciation Potluck to recognize current and past club presidents as well as to present a special award to persons who have made significant contributions in our dance community. This "TVC Recognition Award" was presented to Lane and Marie Clem, members of the Eager Beavers and the TVC. They were recognized for their commitment to and leadership of the square dance community.  They have held multiple offices in their clubs, the Tualatin Valley Council, and with the Oregon Federation at the State level.  Lane is currently in a 2-year term as Treasurer of the State Federation and is in his third year as the Treasurer for the TVC.  Marie is the current Vice President of the Eager Beavers.  Both of them have been instrumental in the re-writing of the By-Laws and the Practices and Procedures for the Valley Squares and Eager Beavers clubs.  Lane has helped re-write the TVC by-laws and Constitution, the P & P's and just recently the Delegates Introduction to TVC document.  With a standing ovation they were presented an engraved plaque and gold bars by Gary Clark, Council President.
