The Wave Steppers’ first dance of 2016 will be Saturday, March 12th at Garibaldi City Hall, with club caller Joe Wrabek and line dance instructor Gwen Kiel.  City Hall is at 107 6th St. (at Acacia), and there’s a brand-new big parking lot next door on Acacia.  Festivities begin at 7 p.m.  This is Crab Races Weekend (the world-famous Crab Races are held at the Old Mill, just a few blocks away), probably the second-biggest weekend of the year in Garibaldi.  If you need a hotel or motel room, or RV space, it’s a good idea to reserve it early.

Square dance classes continue every Wednesday evening, 6 to 8 p.m., at the Tillamook Elks lodge, 1907 Third St. in downtown Tillamook.  The lessons are taught by club caller Joe Wrabek, and are free.  (Joe also brings home-baked cookies.)

From March through October, the Wave Steppers will be having dances on the second Saturday of the month, on the Dance Floor at Garibaldi City Hall.  April’s dance (April 9th) will feature veteran caller and cuer Jim Hattrick.
