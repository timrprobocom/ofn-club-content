Things have been going great for the TT's. We had a fun Chili Dance in January Yummy. Then we attended the Mid-Winter Festival at the end of the month and had a great time.

      In February we are planning our annual Chocolate dance that is always a "treat" and Chinese New Year dance. In April we will have our Birthday dance, so look for a flyer soon. 

       We are starting lessons again in February and hope to have a new batch of dancers ready for the activity. Come join us at one of our dances, you will be glad you did....Sandy
