We’ll have a saintly dance in March.  That’s right; St. Patrick’s day is rapidly approaching.  Mike Kious will be calling that night, with Tami Helms cueing.  We always have a lot of nice Pat’s Day decorations, generously furnished by our faithful member, Dorcus Décor.

We’ll also have Jim Hattrick, calling and cueing, on both the 9th and the 23rd.

And we’re going to start making our snacks garlic free.  Our club Director of Oral Hygiene (Mac McGargle) tells us we need to be kissing sweet.

Come join our motley crew any Wednesday evening.
