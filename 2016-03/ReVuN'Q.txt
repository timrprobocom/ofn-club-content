The club is in transition now as we are finishing waltz and going into a season of adding songs to what we know. Maybe a few added steps, but more music than anything else for now. 
      We had six couples in the Mid-Winter Showcase of Rounds. Our instructor, Cheryl, stood by as we performed first on the program. We had one member missing due to illness, so Cheryl’s husband filled in for him. I personally think we did pretty well.
      We planned a Valentine’s Dance on February 11, which will be over by the time you read this. Hope we had fun. Were you there?
       Our summer season will be Tango to keep us busy during convention, festival, and various educational seminars that people will be attending in June, July and August. 
      We dance on Thursdays at the SSDC, so come and join us as we progress through Cheryl’s song list.  Marilyn Schmit
