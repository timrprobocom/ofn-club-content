We have dancers in our club willing to run for offices.  Pat Preston is willing to run for president, a post which she's had previously.  Pat will do a good job for the club.  Rosco Isbell was willing to run for Vice-President.  This is a new experience for Rosco, but he's got heart and determination to do a good job.  One of our new members, Dianne Trippett, is running for secretary.  Dianne has been secretary for other organizations and will do a good job.   Another new member, Tonie Nichols, is running for treasurer.  Tonie's dad, Ray Nichols, was a long time square and round dancer.  The memory board at the hall in Springfield is dedicated to Ray.  Ray's name appears first followed by other dedicated square and round dancers who have passed away.  Tonie's wife, Barbara, made a new banner for our club for use at Mid-Winter festivals when we participate in grand marches and such.  We look forward to a new year with these fine folks.
 
We want to thank the folks who held offices last year.  Thank you to Randy Graboyes, Janet Geiger, Pat Preston and Sharon Greenman.
 
Mimi Mills, lifetime member of Danebo Circle 8, was admitted to Avamere Rehabilitation Center on Chambers Street following surgery on her heel at Riverbend Hospital.  I go see her often.  Mimi is very tired from physical therapy and is itching to go home.  That's always a good sign. 
 
We're discovered that Don Anderson, former member of Danebo Circle 8, is at the same rehabilitation center right across the hall from Mimi.  We all paid him a visit today.  Don had surgery on his foot as well.  Small world.  We pray that Mimi and Don heal quickly and are both on their feet soon.
 
Keep on dancin'
