The Milton-Freewater Muddy Frogs are hopping  along  just fine.  Bill and Neva Reid, our caller and cuer, are back in full swing since their Hawaiian vacation.  Bill is still taking our class members through their Mainstream paces, and Neva is teaching night club two step to our social ballroom class members, all on Sunday afternoons.  Sunday, March 20, will be our regular dance from 3:00-5:00 p.m. at the Milton-Freewater Community Building,  with a potluck following.  Bill and Neva will be doing the honors.  We are a small but friendly club and would love to see you there!

Dancing is healthy!
