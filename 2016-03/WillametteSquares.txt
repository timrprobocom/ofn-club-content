Due to a sudden turn in the weather, the Willamette Squares' new dancer dance ended up being cancelled. However, it was rescheduled for the date of our regular monthly Saturday dance at the Salem Square Dance Center, and it worked out beautifully. It was well attended with seven squares! There were guest callers along with Willamette Squares caller, Sandy Harris, and cuer, Jackie Gale. The room was aptly decorated in a snowflake winter theme. Special thanks to everyone who pitched in and decorated, with special recognition to John Templin and Georgette Hagerman, for their efforts.
       
      On Sunday January 24, we held graduation. Nine dancers graduated: six round 
dancers and three square dancers were honored. Some of the students ordered five boxes of pizza which were enjoyed and appreciated by all. 

      During the Mid-Winter dance in Albany, a number of the Willamette Squares members were represented. We look forward to our regular dance in February with a sample of some chocolate Valentine treats, to celebrate Oregon's birthday, and to recognize present and past presidents' birthdays.
