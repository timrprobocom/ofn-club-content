Recently I was asked what the Federation was up to these days, with the lower number of dancers and clubs, lower attendance at festivals and no National Convention to work on. All negatives, true. But there are positives, too.
The Federation board is in the unique position of having money, experience, and volunteers to help our clubs not only to ride out the storm, but to offer help in recruiting the next generation of dancers. Our job over the next few years is to spread the word that we are not dead.  As representatives you all need to put on a positive attitude and let the clubs know that help is available.
 If your council wants to host a summer festival or weekend festival of another name, we can help. We have experienced people ready and willing to help fill out your committee roster. We can offer advice for venues, callers and cuers, and budgets. We have a $3,000 loan available for seed money to help get the ball rolling.
If your club wants to hold lessons, we can offer the benefit of experience in advertising and holding lessons. We have grants available to help your club pay for advertising, callers and venues.
If your club needs help with paying rent or publicizing dances, we have grants available.
It is up to each one of us to spread the word and be positive about our favorite activity. We need to be out volunteering in our neighborhoods. We need to do demos and parades. To recruit new dancers and do everything we can to keep them coming back with smiles and positive attitudes.
