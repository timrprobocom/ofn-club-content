This March is an unusual month for us, in that we won't have dances at the Congregational Church until April. 
      We're looking forward to our coast trip at Gleneden Beach Community Club and dancing both Friday and Saturday nights, March 11 and 12... We want to mention again that all are welcome! This has been a long standing tradition for the Corvallis Squares. It's been fun to have visitors at this dance in past years, including folks from the former Toledo 49ers. 
      We've decided to go dark the fourth Saturday in March since it's the night before Easter. We'll be back in April with our regular dance nights!  Karen Karplus
