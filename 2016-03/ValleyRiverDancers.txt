Valley River Dancers had a packed house for the new dancers dance in late January. One highlight had to have been the dumbfounded expression on the face of a new dancer when she walked in and saw plus being danced on the floor! With profound relief, she and nearly 100 other dancers (with two squares from the Salem Swingin' Stars) soon enjoyed mainstream to the calling of Randy Dibble.
 
      Come join us on Friday February 26 for our Anniversary Dance. We'll have a half hour of plus beginning at 7:30 and then from 8:00 till 10:30 we'll dance mainstream and rounds.  Also, a shout out to the members and guests who made our Sweetheart Dance so much fun. Thanks!  Perrin Damon
