The club has started square dance lessons each Sunday between 4:00 and 6:00 and has about a dozen students.  We plan on running classes through all the Mainstream level moves.  We have a wide variety of students; youngest is 9-years old, couples, singles, prior dancers, never danced, etc.  As of the end of January we have had four lessons, and not taking any more students unless they have prior experience.

Now that the Holidays are over, we hope to do more visitations and hope to have more visitors at our dances, too.  As a Club we have Mainstream dances with Mike Stout calling on the 1st and 3rd Saturdays and we also have Plus dances with Darrell Kalmbach calling on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Thursday.  We have been doing this a year already now and it has worked out pretty well.  Our cuer in Ken Pratt and he has been doing intermediate Rounds before all of our dances and also doing intermediate Rounds workshop and dance on Sundays from 6:30 to 8:00.

March 19th, 3rd Saturday the Club will be dark as we are visiting the Valley Squares Anniversary Dance.
