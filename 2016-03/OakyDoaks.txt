Everyone seemed to have a great time at Mid-Winter this year.  We had about 20 Oaky Doaks at Lum Yuen Restaurant on Saturday night for dinner. Some members came down for Saturday only, so they had to get in as much dancing as possible in a short period of time. Our own Eugene Ivy, who was the Festivalâ€™s Vendor Chairman, spent most of the weekend with the 20 participating merchants in the Vendor Hall.

 Coming up in March at the Oak Grove Community Hall: the Sadie Hawkins dance on the 5th and our Gospel Dance on the 19th.
