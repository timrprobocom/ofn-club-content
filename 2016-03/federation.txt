<h3>Publicity Column</h3>
<p>
We have set up a Facebook page for the Oregon Federation of Square and 
Round Dance Clubs, and it is ready for your flyers and comments. This 
page has not been created to replace the OFN, but to work with it to 
help spread information and reminders about our dances and special 
activities. Please <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/966191663436515/">visit the
page,</a> join it, and start posting your flyers and reminders. I
will try to forward everything that I see on my personal wall, but I
need help spreading the word! If your club or council has a FB page,
please send me the name and I'll "like" it so that I can help you keep
the Federation's page up to date with your dancing information. Please
encourage all of your dancing friends to like the Federation page too.
If you have information on the National Convention, festivals, or dances 
that are in another state that you think Oregon dancers would be interested
in attending, please feel free to post this information, too.
