A big shout out to our Vice President Nancy Donaldson for organizing our visitation to the Valley River Dancers New Dancer Dance on January 23. We had 19 members of our club in attendance to assist the new dancers. It was Great Fun and we got to bring our Banner back!

      We are still recuperating from the excellent time had by everyone at the Mid-Winter Festival with great dancing and loads of fellowship. It was wonderful to catch up with dancers from all over Oregon and Washington!

      We are dancing on March 4 and March 18 at the Salem Square Dance Center. Pre-Rounds are at 7:00 pm, Plus at 7:30 pm, and Mainstream with Rounds at 8:00 pm. Also, mark your calendars for the Salem Swingin' Stars Golden Anniversary Dance on April 15! Come help celebrate 50 years of dancing. Randy Dibble will be calling and Jeanine Norden cueing. Look for the flyer for more information. See you on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
