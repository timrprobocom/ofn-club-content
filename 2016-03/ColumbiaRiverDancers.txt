We made it!  The Columbia River Dancers will be celebrating its first birthday, and what a year it's been -- like any toddler the excitement and sometimes fear of the first year just does not stop.  We started dancing in one place only to end up somewhere else.  We may miss the air conditioning at the YMCA but love the acoustics at the Hazel Dell Grange.  We've changed our lesson day not just once, but twice this year, and it's still only the beginning of February.  As you may know our caller, Jim Hattrick, suffered a stroke at our first lesson held at the Grange, so it was a group of square dancers that quickly reacted to get emergency medical aid.  He's doing much better now, and is even able to call part of a dance, but we needed to make some quick adjustments. So our lessons will now be held on Tuesdays which was when Jim had originally planned to hold his Tuesday "Plus and a Little Bit More" dances. And instead of Jim calling our last dance, we hired The King himself, Elvis!  Well... Mark Wheeler.  Jim showed up as well and called several tips.  He never fails to amaze us.
 
We hope you will join us as we celebrate our very first birthday!  On March 12th Adam Christman from Spokane will be calling at our First Anniversary Dance.  We will be giving away commemorative dangles to the first 50 attendees.  Since it will be held just 5 days before St. Patrick's Day, and because our club colors are blue & green, we were thinking we could call it our "Green and Blue Anniversary Dance."  Whatever color you chose, come celebrate with us.

Our second dance in March will be on Saturday, the 26th with a caller to be determined.

Lastly, kudos to the committee of the Mid-Winter Festival.  A great time was had by all of the members of our club and we are looking forward to next year already.
