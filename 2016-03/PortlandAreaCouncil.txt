This is an exciting time of the year for us, as we are nearing elections for our PAC officers.  For the last several years, I have headed the nominating committee.  This year, I am approaching it a little differently.

     Hereâ€™s my new formula.  All year long I listen for complaints about the PAC leadership, and I listen to who says them.  And this time of year I invite those who reproach to run on the board â€&ldquo; to make a change â€&ldquo; to make a difference.  If they donâ€™t run, at least they know why there is no change.  The onus will be on those who reproach.

     Another change Iâ€™m doing is putting anyone down on the nomination list who is interested.  The days of term limits are over.  Itâ€™s not like there are hundreds of people in a council anymore, and very few people are willing to volunteer, thus my willingness to run anybody.  If any complaints, Iâ€™ll put them on the ballet!
