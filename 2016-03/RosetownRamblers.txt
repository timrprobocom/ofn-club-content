A small but boisterous band of Ramblers raised the roof of the Milwaukie Grange at our First Saturday Dance on February 6. In anticipation of Valentineâ€™s Day, our theme was simply â€œChocolate.â€ We arenâ€™t sure if it was all the chocolate we consumed, the frenetic pace set by caller Chuck Garner, or our fabulous visitors from Floor Dusters, Oaky Doaks, and Chaps and Petticoats, but our Fitbits were a-blazing and our footwork was amazing. 

We sure do love to danceâ€&rdquo;and weâ€™d love to dance with YOU at our First Saturday Dance on March 5 at the Milwaukie Grange. Our theme for Marchâ€&rdquo;in anticipation of St. Patrickâ€™s Dayâ€&rdquo;is â€œGet Lucky!â€ Weâ€™ll have a potluck from 6-7 and then alternate Mainstream and Plus tips from 7-9:30. Caller Kris Jensen will be making an encore appearance from Albuquerque for this dance. We warmly welcome couples and solo dancers.

SYIAS!
