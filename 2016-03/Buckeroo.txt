The Buckeroo Barn had Mike Sikorsky from Arizona call our first dance of the New Year.  We had a great time dancing with our friends from all along the I5 corridor.  We had visitors from Yreka, California all the way up to Vancouver, Washington!  The Star Promenaders  from Medford, and the Charlie Brown Squares from Grants Pass, both took home banners for their visitations. The evening was tons of fun and the barn was filled with 15 squares of dancers all enjoying Mike’s energetic performance.

Many of our members, along with a large number of our new dancers, met up at Mid- Winter in Albany. Everyone had a great time dancing and catching up with friends. When we came back home, our new dancers graduated and the barn now has 15 new members! We are excited to welcome them to our “Buckeroo Family”!

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
