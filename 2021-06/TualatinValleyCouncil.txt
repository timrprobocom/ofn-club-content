 The April TVC meeting was held via Zoom meeting.  New COVID rules are an ongoing discussion, with restrictions changing frequently.  SSD was again discussed with all TVC clubs being asked to hold a discussion on this concept so the club delegates can bring a report to the next meeting.
 The annual TVC directory is being prepared for 2021-2022.  Due to Covid, the directory was not published last year.
 A message from TVC President Mike St. Clair: "The TVC is alive and well.  I just wanted to say from looking at the reports that for the most part clubs are communicating and planning the future of our dancing.  Also the TVC is going to plan a picnic this summer just to get every one back on track.  No dancing just a social activity.  We don't have venue or date yet but it will be bring your own picnic and just visit. We will keep you posted.  I am excited about the future even as slow as it is progressing."
