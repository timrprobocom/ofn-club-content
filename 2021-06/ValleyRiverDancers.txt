 Valley River Dancers held a Zoom club meeting April 25th.  The main topic of discussion was when we will be able to start dancing again.  Because of the anticipated changes in Covid restrictions from our Governor, we did not make any decisions other than to try to have a dance on June 11th, if we are able to find an outdoor facility where we would be able to hold a dance.  The date is tentative.  Masks would be required and we would follow covid guidelines.  
 Officers were elected with President, Secretary and Treasurer remaining in office for another year.  New Co-Vice Presidents were elected and we are grateful for Ben & Kimberely being willing to serve in that position.
 The meeting ended with some visiting time which was enjoyed by all who participated.
