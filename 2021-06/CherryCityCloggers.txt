Cherry City Cloggers started clogging once again the first week of April. It was such a wonderful experience after being closed for over a year. We had been having Zoom calls just to keep in touch and it was a very welcome experience for all to start dancing again. We all wore face masks and tried to keep 6 feet apart as much as you can when you haven't seen each other for months and you just want to talk and catch up. We did our best for about five weeks only to come to a screeching halt this last week with the Governor’s new restrictions of no more than six in any kind of a social gathering. So we are now restricted from dancing once again. Mary Ellen, our club president, will be monitoring the Governor’s mandates closely with the hopes we will be back dancing again soon. Not sure what our summer demo season will look like or even if it will happen because we haven't heard whether those places we normally dance will once again be cancelled. Georganne Pfnister
