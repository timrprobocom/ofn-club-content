Not much to report on. We are dark for the summer and will restart in September. Plans are in motion for lessons to start in September. We have not decided on new club caller and cuer yet. It might be fall before that is finalized.

We will be working with the Waldo Hills Community Club on maintenance on the hall over the summer. Petrina Buchheit
