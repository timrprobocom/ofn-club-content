As I sit here watching Saturday evening TV, it is time to get another article off to the editor for the OFN.
		
We will continue to work on Bolero through the end of May and then see where we go from there. The Covid took us out of our hall for the first Thursday of May, and it is unknown at this writing what happens after that. We have a dance planned for May 15, a phase 3-4 dance with some 5’s. Will see what the risk level is by then as to whether we have it or not. Stay tuned for next month’s article to see what is reported. 

I am also working on thoughts for a phase 2 dance in late July or August to get the easy dance level dancers ready for lessons in September. It is intended to be kind of an early kick off dance to get some floor time for them. Details to follow when more plans fall in place. Marilyn Schmit
