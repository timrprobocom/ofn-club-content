On May 7th, Clackamas and Marion Counties moved from Extreme Risk to Moderate Risk COVID regulations.  On that very night, Chaps and Petticoats went dancing at Salem Square Swinging Stars.  This time there were six Chaps members - except for the wearing of masks/shields and sanitizing, it felt normal.

Chaps and Petticoats had an outside Club fellowship on Sunday, May 16th at a member’s home on the water - perfect 80-degree temp and no-mask freedom.  Our primary focus was to discuss reopening our lessons and dances.  Since our venue is a Grange, when we open depends first on the State mandates and second on insurance compliance with National Grange - so opening is in a ‘holding’ pattern as of this meeting.

We covered dancing and lesson options in our meeting:  SSD Lesson followed by SSD Dancing, same night, was popular though how to blend from an SSD lesson plan (after graduation) into Mainstream teaching was unclear - more ‘Zoom’ training discussions are needed.   To keep dancing, other dancing options were discussed:  Contra, Line-dancing, Rounds and even “ABC dancing (where one learns on the fly) were some - perhaps Chaps will choose another night to dance the other options.

It was nice to think about increasing our membership with these dancing options, though for now, we closed with lots of options, lots of questions and lots of decisions to make.

Happy Feet,
Betty Chipps
