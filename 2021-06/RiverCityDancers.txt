At the time of writing this report, no date has been set for River City Dancers to resume dancing.  We are all hopeful that it will be soon. We will be sure to let everyone know as soon as we know.

Our club members keep in touch with email, phone calls and occasional zoom meetings. Officers for this coming year will be elected soon.
