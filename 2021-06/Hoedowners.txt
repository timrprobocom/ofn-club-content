 April 2021 had insanely warm and dry weather for those of us here in the northwest.  The only inclement weather was the Saturday we had scheduled our annual road cleanup, so we'll try again soon.  The abundant sunshine kept reminding me of that great Beatles tune "Here Comes the Sun" written by George Harrison.
 Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo, here comes the sun,
And I say it’s all right.
 Little darling, it’s been a long cold lonely winter,
 Little darling, it feels like years since it’s been here.
 Maybe not years but over a year and an indelible part of our lives changed and was diminished.  Hoedowners believe we have a plan to be on our way back. 
 Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces,
 Little darling, it seems like years since it’s been here.
 Have you had a chance to drop by our Saturday night round dances?  It had been a wonderful way to see familiar faces and smiles behind the masks.  
 Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
 Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
 We have been feeling the warmth during our round dances with a nice group attending on alternate Saturdays.  Thank you Randy for accommodating everyone including my husband and I who are novices.  Thank you to all the experienced round dancers who have tolerated our short comings.  Waltz away!
 Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo, here comes the sun
 And I say it’s all right
 We will be all right!  And on that note keep your eyes and ears open about Hoedowner doings in May! We may have a surprise or two.
 Our Rounds on the second and fourth Saturday; practice or brush up 6-7pm, dancing 7-9pm.  Singles are welcome.  Masks and social distancing required.
 If I don’t get to see your smiling face, at least let me see your smiling eyes.
