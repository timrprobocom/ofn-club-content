 Middle of April our club had the largest club meeting ever.  We met at the Senior Center, with all the room for social distancing.  We were trying to determine if we were at a place we could begin making even tentative plans.  After lots of discussion, hopes and dreams, reality had to set in and put everything on hold.  
 We did determine that we are eager to be with dancing friends again, eager enough to show up for a meeting!  It seems that not much has changed in the way people are thinking about moving forward with dancing.  We discussed dance frequency, lessons and club activities without any change.
 Last time I wrote about all the work on the Senior Center that John Poole, Dick Sims and others have accomplished.  Now, it will be time for the ladies to sort, clean and organize the storage.  After which, we will have lunch. Woo hoo, ladies lunch. 
 One of our more recent members, Terry Robbins, died at home with his wife, Londa at his side.  We will remember the joy and smiles Terry brought to our dances and how much he supported our lessons.
 Until our next communication may we all continue to smile and support our dance friends.
