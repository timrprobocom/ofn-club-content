 The club has not been dancing.  We have been e-mailing our each other for communication.
 We normally have been dark during the summer anyway, so our next dance will likely be held in September.
 We are a Plus club, but in general for the larger organization we support clubs going to SSD, and we support the TVC having their dances in the SSD format.
