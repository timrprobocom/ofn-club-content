We are still not dancing yet and no date has been set for restarting our dances in Hall B of the Emerald Square Dance Center in Springfield.  I am hoping soon we will know more since the CDC has lifted the mask requirements for both indoor and outdoor functions as long as one has been vaccinated.  Most square dances I know have been able to get their vaccinations already although some are still in the process who are younger and/or had immunological problems, making getting vaccinated problematical.  Some clubs have started dancing on a regular basis however so one can hope.  Meanwhile some of us continue to practice our skills in front of a YouTube virtual video.
Stay safe and well and hope to see you on the dance floor soon,
