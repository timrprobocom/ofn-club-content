 The closer we get to "normal" the itchier our feet are to dance!  But for now, the most normal we can get is planning for our annual August club picnic in the park. It's something to look forward to, and maybe we'll even be maskless!  Otherwise we continue on with our monthly club-chats and board meetings over Zoom, and we talk about what the future may hold for the new style of square dance lessons someday... We think the new style will be very user-friendly (student-friendly?) and we're ready to get started whenever it's safe.
