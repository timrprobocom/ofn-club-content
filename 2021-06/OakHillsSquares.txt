 Oak Hills Squares folks are continuing with our bi-weekly zoom meeting, keeping tabs on everyone.  On alternate weeks anyone who wants to can join a group walk in the neighborhood.  We also had our first game night for those brave enough to participate.  It was a fun time playing Pegs and Jokers with lots of visiting.  Another night is planned soon.  Our dance location is still not available, so we continue to wait for that.
 Happy Memorial Day!
