Willamette Squares president is back from AZ and is anxious to get the square dance show back on the road! We are planning to have a dance on June 26. Since most of our club members have not danced in quite a while, which is likely to be true for other dancers, the dance will be more like a workshop to review where needed. It will be fun to gather once again at the Salem Square Dance Center to dance and catch up with fellow square dancers. Please, wonâ€™t you join us? Jodee
