 All our members are plugging along, waiting for the day we can resume square dancing.  Most members have gotten their shots or will have by the time this is published.  We are planning for a social gathering sometime in July with the hope we can begin planning our dances and classes.  At least we will be able to visit with one another.  
 Hope everyone is well and getting through this time as best they can.  Take care.
