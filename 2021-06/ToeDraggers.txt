 I’ve really been enjoying these occasionally warm days we’ve been having. It’s a glimmer of brighter days to come.
 A few of us Toes have had a couple of fun lunch dates, it is so nice to talk to friends face to face. We are even planning a Toes meeting at the Big Toe’s house & potluck for those that feel comfortably safe in doing so. We’ll also have Zoom on the computer for everyone else. Time to finally set some possible dates for returning to the grange & life as a square dancer & active community member. We’ve heard news of the Promenaders having 18 people at a round dance! Hope springs again!
 Keep keeping on the safe side & stay well. See you all real soon.
