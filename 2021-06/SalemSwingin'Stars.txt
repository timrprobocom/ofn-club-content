Salem Swingin' Stars are dancing again!!! 

The latest round of restrictions meant that we had to cancel our 5th Friday Plus Dance but we were able to start our 1st Friday Dance again for May.

We are averaging 4-5 squares on the floor each dance.  Our numbers have stayed below the 50 person limit for the hall.

Thank you to all of the dancers for wearing their masks or face shields.  Hopefully sooner rather than later we can dance without them.

We will continue to dance our regular schedule as long as we are able to.  Our club does not go dark for the summer months.

Dances will be posted on our FaceBook page - Salem Swingin' Stars Square Dance.

Hope to see you on the dance floor.
