We are still in hiatus, but getting closer to being back to dancing.  We've cancelled dances thru June at this point, and will make a decision on our July dance soon.  We only have 1 scheduled dance on July 17th.  We will be dark in August as normal due to the County Fair. With luck, we can start classes again in September.  We so look forward to having classes and dances again!!!  We are very excited to have Mike(and Lisa) Seastrom for an entire weekend of events in October!!!  Watch for the flyer on all weekend events; with the featured event our regular Saturday nite dance. There will be additional events happening Friday and Sunday as well.  We were disappointed to have to cancel this year's Boatnik Festival - but 2022 will be wonderful with Eric Henerlau & Dan (Allison) Drumheller!!  Plan your 2022 Memorial Day weekend and come join us!!Going to be a GREAT time!!!!  We look forward to seeing everyone on the dance floor soon!!
