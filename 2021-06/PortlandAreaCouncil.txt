Most of our council meeting was on the condition of our clubs and getting ready to dance.  If a club is short of people to do club chores, the club can merge, employ a professional business manager, or become a caller run club.  (Yes, you can have a caller run club and still be a federated club; however, it still has to be a non-profit.)  It was mentioned that it is important to keep up with Federation and PAC dues.
