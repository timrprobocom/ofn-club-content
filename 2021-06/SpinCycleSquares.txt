We were able to have a social distanced meeting outside at the hall and made the decision to start hosting dances from 4:00 - 6:00 Sunday evenings in June.  Our capable caller, Tim Matteson, will adapt and call to the floor.  This will be our first chance to dance since March of 2020.  Below is a link to our website.  Here is the phone number of our president, David Lajoie. 541-520-7311. Please call David or check out our website to make sure we are, indeed, dancing.  Nowadays we are planning everything by ear and on a week to week basis regarding COVID guidelines, etc.  Right now all we know is that fully vaccinated persons may gather indoors or out without masks.  A lot of us are continuing to wear masks nonetheless just to be on the safe side.  We are considering using a waiver for dancers to fill out and sign.  Single Trees did this at their first dance on May 14.  Their dance was a huge success with three squares having a blast.  If you have your COVID card that would be helpful as well.  Thank you for your vigilance and continued safe measures in regards to the pandemic.  We hope to see you in June if not before!

Yay to dancing again,
