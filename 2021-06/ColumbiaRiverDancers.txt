  As the song goes, ”June is busting out all over”, but not for the Columbia River Dancers.  We are still in a holding pattern.  I saw some activity at a grange near our house so it might mean that the granges are starting to open up.  Great news if that is true, but the Hazel Dell Grange gets mighty warm if not down right hot in the summer months.  We are still looking forward to September opening.
 Jim Hattrick was supposed to have had some surgery at the end of May and if he is healed, he will be calling for us this fall.  He said he was going to do round dance reviews before the club lessons on Tuesday nights.
 Until then, GET YOUR SHOTS, and remember that the Right and Left Grand usually starts with the right hand.
 Stay healthy.
