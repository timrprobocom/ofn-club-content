Things are starting to look a little more hopeful for us all.  In our last board meeting, which actually took place in our president's home (yes! In person!), we discussed the possibility of starting round dances (with all the accompanying precautions) but decided against it.  We have mostly square dancers in our club.  Only about 4-5 regular round dance couples so it didn't seem prudent for so few people.  We decided to try to open everything up in September.  That is, lessons and dances.  We will not use a strict SSD format for lessons since Jim has been using a format which is very close to that for years.  And it works very well!  
Beginning in September we start 8-week sessions every 8 weeks.  People advance as they are comfortable in doing so, often repeating basic and doing mainstream and plus all in the same evening.  Angels galore!  We do plus first and those who can stay for the rest of the evening do so.  

We also talked about our club picnic in August.  Typically, we introduce new officers at the picnic.  Our elections are going on right now.  This year, as with the PAC, our 2021 officers volunteered to serve again.  There will be only one change: Tom Halpenny, who has been serving as secretary for years, will continue on as our web manager (and data preserver) and Matt Driggers volunteered to run for the secretary position.  So unless someone does some right-in running, which is doubtful, that will be the only change for 2022. 

Hope this finds you all well vaccinated and healthy!   Keep on Keepin' on!
