We did not have a dance the end of May.  Things with the pandemic change from week to week, and there wasn't time to decide on how to manage a dance considering everyone may not have had a chance to get their shots, and we do not have a club roster.  Our dancers come from all of our federated clubs and other clubs as well. Therefore, our next scheduled 5th Saturday Dance will be July 31.  We should know by then if that date is a go.  We are hoping that it is.  
 
Thank you for your continued vigilance regarding the pandemic.  
 
Can't wait to call and cue for you,
Christina Corelli, Secretary
