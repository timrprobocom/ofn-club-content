The Hayshakers and the Wave Steppers continue to support one another in our dances.  It really helps both of the clubs.  We will continue to do so.  Be sure to call up before you plan your visit.  Thanks.
 Remember, the Seaside Sashay is coming up in October.  Be sure to look for the flyers either at the dances or on line.  We hope to see many of you there.
