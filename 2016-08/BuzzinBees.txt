Summer greetings from the Buzzin ' Bees.  Our club is dark until September.  We will start lessons 9/11 at the Hazel Dell Grange - specifics to come in the next newsletter. Our first club meeting will be 9/12 at the Peach Tree Restaurant in Hazel Dell.  We eat at 6:30 with the meeting at 7:30. Our first dance is 9/17 with pre - rounds at 7:30 and Mainstream at 8pm. We dance at the Hazel Dell Grange. 

Our club picnic is coming up on 7/23. We will meet at Bill and Linda Lundin's house again this year and we really appreciate their hospitality. It is a potluck and we will have a planning meeting after the food. Bring food and a chair and your ideas for next year. We have a bunch of great cooks in the club so this is always a pleasure.  

Many of the Bees will be joining Mike & Debbie Combs for a campout at Silver Springs Campground on the weekend of August 12-14th. Should be fun around the campfire. Hope you are having a great summer.
