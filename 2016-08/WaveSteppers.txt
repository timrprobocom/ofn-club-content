The Wave Steppers’ square dance and clogging demonstration at the Tillamook County Fair will be on Senior Day, Thursday, August 11th, from 12:15 to 1:00pm on the county fair’s Courtyard Stage.  Club caller Joe Wrabek and clogging instructor Gwen Kiel will choreograph the dancers.  We’ll have a couple of members in square dance regalia working the crowd during the demonstration handing out coupons for free square dance classes starting after Labor Day.  There is usually a big crowd for events on the Courtyard Stage.
 The club’s “County Fair Dance,” which happens the last day of the Tillamook County Fair, Saturday August 13th, will have caller Darrell Kalmbach and cuer Connie Clark; Connie will also be cueing at the “Elvis Dance” Saturday, Sept. 10th, with caller Mark Wheeler as Elvis.  And the last dance of the 2016 season, a “Fall Dance” Saturday, Oct. 8th, will have club caller Joe Wrabek and line dancing with Gwen Kiel.
 The Wave Steppers’ dances are held at Garibaldi City Hall, 107 Sixth Street (just a block off US 101, 9 miles north of Tillamook).  About two-thirds of the second floor of City Hall is a dance floor, built in the 1940s for the old Firemen’s Balls.
 The club’s free square dance classes taught by club caller Joe Wrabek continue on Wednesdays, 6 to 8 pm at the Tillamook Elks Lodge, 1907 Third St. in downtown Tillamook.
