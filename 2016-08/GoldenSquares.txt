Sad news first. Mary Slocum and Larry Jacobsen, past and present members of the Golden Squares, recently passed away. They will be missed.
Our annual pajama dance is August 1 and August 29 is pie night. We will be dark September 5 on Labor Day.
Our Wednesday afternoon plus workshop has been cancelled until September 7.
We would like to thank all the visitors who have attended our dances. Without you, we would not have enough dancers for the dances. See you in a square somewhere. Dolly Yarnell
