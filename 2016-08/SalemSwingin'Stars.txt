Good Summer to All.

We have had a great time with our dances this summer.

On July 1 we had a visit from Bill & Greta Luper from Jacksonville, Florida.  They chose our club to complete their quest of dancing in all 50 states.  They drove from Florida to Salem.  Whew, a long trip to be sure.  The club presented them with a handmade card by Lanie, Jo had dangles made for them and Harriet ordered a special cake.  It was a fun evening.

Look for their picture with our caller Randy Dibble.

We are dancing the 1st and 3rd Fridays in August so please come join us in our air conditioned hall.

See you on the dance floor.
