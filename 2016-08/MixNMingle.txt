By this time all the regular readers of this column have noted that almost every report includes a reminder to check our website for changes, especially for weather that makes dancing at the grange impossible.  June Fourth's weather lived up to the forecast, and we had to cancel the dance.  June 18 had perfect dance weather.  We hope that all the rest of the summer dances go as planned, including our Root Beer Float Dance August 6 and our Watermelon Dance September 17. 
 Keep an eye on our website, though, just in case!
