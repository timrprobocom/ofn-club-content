We are looking forward to another year of dancing at the Douglas County Fair the evenings of August 10-13.   It is a fun night of dancing from 7:00 pm ‚Ä&ldquo; 9:30 pm and what says ‚Äúsummer‚Äù more than dancing at a county fair?  If you have time, pencil us in on your calendar, hop in your car and come and join us.  The space where we dance is near the front entrance so if you come to dance with us you will have no problem finding us. 

Check out the info on our flyer but a few other things to know are:
l. Square dance attire is required to be on the dance floor.
2. Please wear your badge
3. If you are wearing your square dance attire and badge you will not be charged to enter the Fair.
4. The expectation is that if the fair is not charging you to attend, in return you should be in the square dance area when we are dancing. (NOT at the evening entertainment or taking in the fair festivities.)
5. Feel free to come early or stay after the dancing ends and enjoy all of the other fair activities.

We hope to see you there!
