What happened in June for our Hoedowners; weddings, graduations, recitals, anniversaries, all the family festivities of early summer?  We hope you had a chance to enjoy these rituals with your friends and family.  Did we dance?  Of course!  No one wanted to miss the annual Strawberry Delights dance and those fabulous Oregon strawberries.
 Whoa, and the on the 25th we enjoyed the Mr. Potato Head Dance.  Is this the Mr. Potato Head of your childhood with big shoes, white gloves and odd hats?  Don’t think so.  Sally Duyck cruised multiple Goodwill stores and rounded up a multitude of the modern little fellas.  The buffet table centerpiece was a huge potato head dressed as the villain in the Star Wars Saga.  DARTH TATER!  He wasn’t too intimidating as everyone gathered round for the baked potato bar and toppings.
 In September we’ll be having our Back to School Dance Sock Hop on the 10th.  Please bring school or lunch pails supplies to donate.
 Our falls lessons begin, Wednesday, Sept 21st.  The first two lessons are free.  Daryl is a wonderful instructor and even if you’re an experience dancer, you can brush up on your mainstream. We’ve added a few new updates we think you’ll enjoy. 
 September 24th will be our Farmer’s Market Dance.  Food will be fresh from the field.  Farmer’s tans are welcome and encouraged.
