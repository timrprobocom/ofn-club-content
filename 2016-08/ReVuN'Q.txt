Another month has flown by and we are sailing through the Tango lessons. We lost one couple to bone spurs but they will be back in the fall, hopefully all healed and ready to go. 
We are collecting thoughts on what rhythm to dance for fall lessons and have one kind of selected, but will wait for a bit yet before announcing it. 
We had 11.5 couples at our birthday dance and Ray and Virginia Walz came by to say hello and catch up with friends. Nice to see them. 
July and August have three dates that Cheryl and Geof are out of town, so Jeanine Norden and Christina Corelli will be filling in for her. Hope you can join us for some fun with them.  Marilyn Schmitt
