<h3>Publicity and Education</h3>
<p>Over the next few months, I will be sharing information with you on various subjects that our clubs might find useful.&nbsp; If you have questions about the information presented or have an idea for a subject for another issue, please email me at <a href="mailto:Kathy@4roberts.us">Kathy@4roberts.us</a>.&nbsp; This month, our topic will be on when to request dance insurance for your Federated Club activities and what to do if there is an injury.</p>
<p>Insurance for your regular dance location &amp; dates and your regular lessons location &amp; dates are listed once a year on the Federation or Association Club Listing Form. &nbsp;In addition to listing your dance information, all club members are listed on an insurance club roster. &nbsp;Insurance Chairman Kay Rogers will be distributing the forms and directions to the council delegates during the OFSRDC September State Meeting for the 2016-2017 dance year.</p>
<p>If your club is considering holding a demo dance, or dancing during a mystery trip, dancing in a parade, dancing in a different location on your regular night, hosting a special dance, or dancing at a time different from what your club lists on its annual Federation or Association Club Listing Form, you must request insurance for this special dance activity by submitting a Notification of Dance Event Form (<a href="http://www.squaredance.gen.or.us/insurance/NotificationOfEvent.html">www.squaredance.gen.or.us/insurance/NotificationOfEvent.html</a>) &nbsp;through the link on the Federation website prior to the dance.&nbsp; This includes ALL club activities where you will be dancing. You only need to turn in one form per event if several clubs are involved, the club or council that is taking the lead should submit the form.&nbsp; This form should be turned in even if you are only going to dance once. It should also be completed and turned in even if you are participating in a demo dance where the hosting party has their own insurance.&nbsp; Our insurance does not cover you while you are traveling to and from your special location &ndash; it covers your dancers at your dance event.</p>
<p>If a dancer is injured during a Federation dance, an Accident Report Form needs to be completed and submitted to our Insurance Chairman Kay Rogers through the insurance link on the Federation website (<a href="http://www.squaredance.gen.or.us/insurance/AccidentForm.html">www.squaredance.gen.or.us/insurance/AccidentForm.html</a>).&nbsp; For those times you do not have internet access, an Accident Report Form (<a href="http://www.usda.org/insinfo/accident%20report%20form.pdf">www.usda.org/insinfo/accident%20report%20form.pdf</a> ) should be kept in your dance halls, in your cash box, or carried with you to a special event in case of an injury. Once you have internet access, submit the information that you gathered through the link.</p>
<p>Remember to check out the Educational Seminar during Summer Festival in Seaside on how to use Social Media to promote your club&rsquo;s activities.&nbsp; Amanda Roberts will be presenting her seminar at 10:00 am Saturday morning. If you haven&rsquo;t registered for Summer Festival all ready, look for the registration form in this month&rsquo;s OFN and register. You don&rsquo;t want to miss out on the fun happenings!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember to submit your dance flyers to the OFN before the 18th of each month.&nbsp; Dance information and or flyers can also be posted to the Oregon Federation of Square and Round Dance Clubs Facebook page for additional exposure any time before your dance.</p>
