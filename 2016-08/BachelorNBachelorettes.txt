It’s my turn to write the column again.

Every so often (about this time of year) we get questions on how it is we dance all year round, including the summer. Miss Fluff likes to say it’s so our members don’t forget to come back in the fall. The real reason, however, is that it is very profitable for us to dance all year round.  We get dancers from all over America visiting us during the summertime, as well as local dancers who would not come to us during the other months.

We can also better plan our summer and fall activities if we don’t go dormant.  For instance, Aug 16th, we will answer the call of our council to serve food at Burgerville on McLoughlin Blvd.  This will provide monies for both our council and our own club, as well as great advertising.  Most non-profits do have to have fund raisers, and summertime is a good time to do them.
