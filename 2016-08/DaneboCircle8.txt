We will have two dances in August.  August 6 will be Lennie Ludiker and Jackie Gale.  August 20 will be Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli calling and cueing.

The new dance season will begin September 17.  Dances will be held on the third Saturdays thereafter.  So, earmark your calendars for the third Saturdays for the 2016-2017 season.

 
Keep on dancing!
