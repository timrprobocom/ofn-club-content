Our club will not be holding our regular dances in August because the Polk County Fair (the BEST county fair ever) will be going on.  Our club members work for the fair taking admission fees and counting attendance, and for this we make the money to cover our class costs. This sure beats a baked sale to raise money.
Starting with our dances in September, we will be changing our dance time to have pre-rounds (our first dance of the month) or pre-plus (our second dance of the month) at 7:00 p.m. and our dance will be held from 7:30 to 10:00pm.
Look for the flyer, next month, for our Sock Hop which we will hold at our second dance in September. Happy Dancing. Linda Neuschwander
