Our Starlight Parade floats were a huge success with 35 dancers from all over the Willamette Valley. Our dancers were from Eugene, the Portland area, and Vancouver Washington clubs who rocked the night away. We had Youth from Silverton and Boring on the back float with some very high energy dancing. The front float had over 2 squares, who rotated in and out.  Everyone danced to the excellent calling of Scott Zinzer.  
 
It was a hot evening and the thermometer had hit 101Â° before the sun had set. But everyone riding on the float had a fun time while dancing and while waving at the huge crowd.

Terry and Sandy Heiken let us use their pickup as a Tow Vehicle. Their son, Brian Heiken, drove the pickup while his wife, Ali and sons, Jesse and Austin blew bubbles at the crowd. Thanks to the Heikens for their generosity!

Danny and Carol Williamson are members of the River City Riders. They rode their "Horses" in the Starlight Parade and were a huge hit with the kids and the young at heart. The Williamsons had a great time "Horsing around"!

We believe that we reached our objective when we demonstrated to the crowd just how much fun square dancers have while dancing to some wonderful music. The announcers kept repeating, Square Dancing is a Fun form of excercise, an excellent social outlet, and a mental challenge. And that Square Dancing is Friendship set to music. Fun was had by all!
