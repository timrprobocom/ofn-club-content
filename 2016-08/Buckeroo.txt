June was filled with prep for our annual Buckeroo Round Up. We had Scot Byers and his lovely wife Erin call and cue for us. This was the second year they joined us for the Round Up. We spent three full days dancing and enjoying the company of dancers from around the area. Planning has already begun for the 2017 Round up! Mark your calendar now and plan to join us as we welcome Dan Nordby and Mary Ann Callahan!

We will be dark in July as we do some maintenance work and go on lots of visitations! We are all looking forward to getting back out on our own dance floor in August! We hope to see many people join us at the Douglas County Fair in August as we dance the nights away under the stars!

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
