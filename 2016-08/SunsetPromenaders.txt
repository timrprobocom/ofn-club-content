We have graduated 9-students and they have come to our dances and are dancing well.  We wish we had more new people but then all clubs feel that way.  We just have to take care to encourage our dancers and work to make our clubs better.  
Saturday August 6th and August 20th are our Mainstream dances for the month.
The Sunset Promenaders is having our annual Club picnic on Sunday August 7th at Noble Woods Park from 3:00 until 9:00.
 The Promenaders Plus dances will be held Thursday August 4th and 18th from 7:00 until 9:30 at our normal venue, the IOOF Hal in Hillsboro.
 We are looking forward to the Seaside Sashay in October on the 21st, and 22nd.  Hope all of you are coming to the beach that weekend with us.  We have an excellent callers, one from Canada, Ray Brendzy and also local Richard Lane calling and Debbie Taylor from Washington doing the cueing.  With those people, you know we are going to have a great time.  So get your registration in now and also get a room reserved for your weekend.  If you donâ€™t find any forms on your bulletin board call 503-848-3841.
