The next TVC event is our annual Hahn Barn Dance on Sunday August 21st. Terry Halley will be our caller/MC with Julie Stiers as our cuer/MC.  Other callers and cuers will be invited from the floor to call or co-call a tip. This is always a fun dance with a country social potluck picnic before the dance in the shade beside the lake.  The potluck picnic begins at 5:30 and you have about an hour before pre-rounds begin at 6:30 at the barn.  Mainstream with every third tip Plus is scheduled to begin at 7:00PM and go until 9:00PM.
 Gary and Bette Hahn graciously offer their hospitality each year and it is always a grand time!  Their farm is located at 37280 NW Hahn Rd, Banks, OR 97106.  You may refer to the flyer in the OFN Flyer section for additional details and driving directions.  Call Kathy at 503-590-4187 for more information.
 This dance has always been a great success because of the many dedicated volunteers who help make it happen.  We need set-up and clean-up crews for the picnic. We also need to clean the barn the morning of the dance. It is a great time to get to know other club members - so please recruit people from your club to help.  TVC volunteers, please send your name and activity you would like to help with to Kathy Roberts, at Kathy@4roberts.us
