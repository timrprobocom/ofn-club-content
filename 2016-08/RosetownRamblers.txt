The Ramblers had a wonderful visitation to the Floor Dusters in Yoder on May 30. This visitation stemmed from the April 29 Portland Area Council dance, where the Floor Dusters drew the Rambler’s banner out of the hat. We brought 9 dancers down to Yoder and won our banner back. We even learned a new dance to the tune of Mairis Wedding! What fun! We greatly appreciate the hospitality and friendliness of the Floor Dusters and their callers, Tim Kane and Anthony Egan.
 
The Ramblers have welcomed an enthusiastic and fast-learning group of students to our square dance summer school. Through Week 5 of lessons, they have already learned 36 calls. We look forward to having a full square of new Mainstream dancers in the fall. 
 
A small but intrepid band of Ramblers braved oppressive heat on June 4 for our final monthly dance before our summer break. The official high temperature in Portland that day was a record-setting 98 degrees. We wilted but we didn’t succumb. If this weather keeps up, we may start a Bikram Square Dance Club. Talk about cutting edge!
 
We don’t hold our usual monthly dances in July or August. However, we will be hosting a special community dance at the Q Center, 4115 N. Mississippi Ave., Portland, on Saturday August 20, from 7-9 pm. No dance experience is necessary for this event. We’d love to have you join us with our caller, Ian Craig, as we bring square dance to an uncustomary urban venue.
 
With our light dance schedule in July and August, we will have boundless energy for our return to dancing on the second Saturday in September. That’s September 10, consistent with the move of our monthly dances from the first to the second Saturday of each month. We alternate Mainstream and Plus tips from 7:30 to 9:30 pm at the Milwaukie Grange. All dancers are welcome, and we love visitors!
 
SYIAS!
