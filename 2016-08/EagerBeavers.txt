June means celebrating summer and celebrating our students who are learning the finer points of Plus.  Thank you, students, for getting the rest of us back in shape and keeping us on our toes.  Now you know our secret; we make mistakes too, but we enjoy dancing and having fun so we keep on going no matter what.  
 Hope you heard he unusual news that we were dark July 4th. Too many people had other commitments to other July 4th activities.  Hope you had a wonderful 4th!
 Six people from our club attended Nationals this year which was excellent as there were only twenty nine from Oregon. Although Tony Oxendine and Jerry Story were callers, the goal of 4000 attendees was just eight people short.
 On Memorial Day, May 30th, we had a big turnout of dancers who did not want to miss the opportunity to dance.
 You are invited to attend our potluck picnic at Noble Woods Park in Hillsboro, August 10th, 3 pm to dusk. Please RSVP to 503-629-7054 with number of people by August 7th so we can order enough chicken for all.  
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons: Rounds 1:00 - 1:30 (Rounds will start at 1:15 during lessons); Plus 1:30 - 3:15 PM, Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
