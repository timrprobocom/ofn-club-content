We had 43 dancers for our July 1st dance celebrating birthdays for KC and the U S of A.   The dinner BBQ before the dance was eagerly consumed then we all slipped upstairs to dance away the night.  Our visitors and members had a great evening of dancing and celebrating friendships.  Thanks KC and Bev for a wonderful evening.
 Speaking of KC, KC and Linda invited the club to their home for a relaxed evening of food and games.  Now does that sound like a great evening?  It was!!!!
 Summer is passing us by quickly, but we are looking forward to our Aug. dances with Hot August Nights theme with KC doing all singing calls and Bev singing and cueing her favorites.  We also are looking forward to our club campout down at the coast.  The Toes have a great time together.  Come and join us for a fun-filled month.
Join us Aug. 5th for our Hot August Nights Dance with all singing calls from KC.  See you in a Square.
