Willamette Squares held its regular monthly square dance the fourth Saturday evening in June at the Salem Square Dance Center. The dancing was lively, the refreshments were plentiful, and as usual everyone had a great time! We are looking forward to our Watermelon dance which is always refreshing and fun.

 Among our summer activities is the annual square dance picnic. And it is time to be recruiting potential square and round dancers for lessons coming this fall. Jodee Howard
