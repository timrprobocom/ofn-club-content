Fourteen Corvallis Squares members had a great evening dancing to the calling of Jim Hattrick and the cueing of Jackie Gale on June 24 in Springfield. We won a banner back from the Single Trees, and are ready for another summer visitation. 
Our club is dark for July and August and we're happy to see there are a variety of dances up and down the valley. 
We're already planning for our fall lessons. We've found that most new dancers have been personally invited by a club member, so we're focusing on that and also making business sized cards with lessons information to hand out.
We recently participated in a square dance demo at the Grace Center, and once again, we hope to dance a demo at the Corvallis Farmers' Market. We hope you're enjoying summer in Oregon; some say nothing else can compare! Karen Karplus
