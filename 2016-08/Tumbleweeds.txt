Summer has been busy for us.  Our July 1st dance was cancelled since so many of our members were going out of town to celebrate.  I tried to get the word out to our regular visitors about the cancellation. We also had to cancel our JULY 22nd dance because the lodge has first chance to use the hall.  Again we tried to get the word out.  We apologize to anyone getting the word.

Bob Keller is busy making plans for a fantastic picnic in August.  

Stella and Jesse Tuft began the Tumbleweed Square Dance Club 44 years ago right after Stella completed her callersâ€™ class.  It was the first daytime square dancing.   The people loved dancing during the day and not having to drive at night for a dance.

Don't forget we have air conditioning and everyone get to dance.
