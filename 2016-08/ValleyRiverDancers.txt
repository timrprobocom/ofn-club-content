If you're reading this before July 22nd, please join us for our annual Dance Under the Stars, Friday, July 22nd, at 7:30 on the tennis courts at the corner of Howard and E. 6th in Newberg. Last year there were more than 10 squares, which makes it a ton of fun. Wear your tennies!

Our fifth Saturday Advanced Dance will be held as scheduled on July 30 from 7 -9:30 at The Estates Auditorium in Woodburn. 

Two July parades included Valley River Dancers: the St. Paul Rodeo Parade and the Newberg Old Fashioned Festival parade. We love showing off our fancy footwork!

We are inventing a new look -- hula in petticoats! Join the fun at our Luau Dance, Friday, August 26, from 7:30  - 10:30 at the Newberg Community Center.
