The Charlie Brown Squares had an absolutely amazing turnout for our Cowboy Round-Up Dance with special guests Eric Henerlau & Dan (Allison) Drumheller on July 16th. 105 dancers celebrated with lots of smiles and laughter!! We did the Post Dance and it was met with even more laughter - it was so much fun. Those that did the post dance received a "Saturday Nite Post" dangle. The Star Promenaders from Medford took home the award for "Most Shoes on the Floor." The decorations were fabulous with everything from boots and saddles on the floor to bridles and ropes on the walls; as well as barn doors and a hangman's rope. Check out our website and/or facebook page for pictures!!  We are so thankful to everyone that came from near and far to enjoy this special dance with us!!!

We were dark for the 1st Sat dance on July 2nd,  however we had 3 Squares for a Patio Potluck Party and Demo dance at PhilBilly's (Phil Ramey). Phil & Chuck Simpkins called and we enjoyed lots of fun dancing, food and friendship.

We will be dark for the month of August due to the County Fair, but the Charlie's always enjoy traveling to different dances and festivals during the month. Next up is Diamond Lake Festival hosted by The Star Promenaders & featuring the talented Jet Roberts & MaryAnn Callahan (& Craig Cowan) July 20-23rd. The following week is Summer Festival in Seaside. Then the Rogue Squares of Medford will celebrate their 1st birthday on August 6th.

Hope to see everyone in a square soon!
