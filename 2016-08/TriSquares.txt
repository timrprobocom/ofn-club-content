The mystery trip took place on June 25th on a beautiful, sunny day.  The trip included many back roads including a view of Parrett Mountain and a boy scout camp located in the forest.  The mystery trip included a tip called by Terry Halley at the Bull Mountain Farmersâ€™ Market.  Eventually, the trip ended up at the Willamette Squares in Salem.  A big thank you to Deb Mandeville, Lynnea Loveberg, Betty Chipps and many more for a fun and successful mystery trip.
 The Tri Squares are continuing to visit our square dancing friends this summer. Our next visitation will be at the Valley Squares On August, 6th!  There theme is Summertime Fun.  There will be an hour from 7pm to 8pm where new dancers will have an opportunity to show off their skills.  We look forward to seeing all of our friends soon and at our dances in Fall.
