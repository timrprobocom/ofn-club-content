The country Cut-Ups thank everyone who showed up at our pancake breakfast and helped us raise funds to keep the Boring Barn going. We enjoy the whole community of square dancers and are also grateful to those who came out to make our Halloween Dance a success. There were some great costumes and Craig Abercrombie kept it lively! We hope to see a great turn out for the New Yearâ€™s Eve Dance, also. 

Our Plus dancing skills will be sharpened by workshops every Thursday evening taught by Scott Zinser. Our club has a half hour of Plus dancing at the beginning of every third and fifth Saturday dance, as well as the third tip of each dance. 

We enjoyed a visitation recently to the Columbia River Dancers and have one coming up for the Tri-Squares. We welcome any clubs to come out and visit us on the first, third, or fifth Saturdays of the month. We dance all year long. For those who struggle with stairs, we are all on one level, and we have great food. The Boring Barn is a fun place to dance, in spite of the name!
