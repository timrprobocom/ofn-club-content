We do have an advanced class going on right now.  Most of the class are experienced advanced dancers and can really help out.  Or course, there are those times when the experienced dancers go the wrong way, and the new members of the advanced class helps them!

We look forward to November 21, third Saturday,  when national caller, Kris Jensen, will be here to call for us.  Advanced is from 3:00 - 4:30, potluck at 4:30 and Mainstream and Plus from 5:30 - 8:00.  Spin Cycle Squares is famous for potlucks.  We'll also have a Silent Auction.  We are all encouraged to bring wonderful items for the silent auction.  This will all happen in Hall B (park behind the building) at the Emerald Dance Center / 2095 Yolanda / Springfield, OR, 97477.  This is a Saturday so we will not dance the following day, November 22. 
 
Please join us almost any Sunday evening at 5:30 at the Emerald Dance Center.  We usually dance in Hall A and are enjoying the new speakers.
 
Happy dancing,
Christina Corelli
