Please join us at the Aloha Grange for our dances this month.  We start with the Toy Drive Dance December 5th where we ask for new, unwrapped toys, art supplies, etc.  Julie Stiers will be filling in for Connie at that dance.  Chuck Garner will be calling at both that dance and our December 19th Snowflake Dance when Connie returns.

Although Valley Squares was dark for October, we didn't hibernate from the dancing world.  Five of us freaked out the seniors playing Bingo at the Kelso Senior Center when we showed up at the wrong venue for R Square D's Octoberfest.  I guess they worried about these strangely dressed people running off with their Bingo loot.  We eventually wound our way to the Rose Valley Grange, and had a great time.  

An impressive contingent feasted on the Harvest Dinner and danced to national caller Dan Preedy at the Sunset Promenaders Anniversary Celebration.  We had at least a square at Seaside Sashay and enjoyed a group dinner at Dundee's Bar and Grill.  We also had loads of fun, lots of exercise, and multiple chances to practice All Position Dancing to national callers Chris Phillips, Mike DeSisto, and Gary Monday at Rosetown Ramblers' Scares and Squares Monster Bash Weekend.  We finished the month by loading into Bill Calder's van and attending the Tri-Council Halloween Dance in Vancouver.  

Our students are progressing rapidly in the Mastering Mainstream and Beginning Plus workshops Tuesday evenings at Aloha Grange.  Our Basics/Mainstream lessons begin in January, so if fall students from the area clubs need extra floor time, they should join us Tuesday evenings at 7 PM starting January 12th.  Also, recruit your friends and neighbors - what a perfect New Year's Resolution: Start Dancing!!! 

See you in a square!
