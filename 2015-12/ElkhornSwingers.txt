The next dance hosted by the Elkhorn Swingers will be Saturday, November 21, 2015 with Jim Swanson calling squares and Zina Rapp cueing rounds starting at 7:00 p.m.  Since we did not even have enough dancers for a square at our last dance, please let Karen (541-936-7892) know whether or not you plan to attend.  If we don't have commitments from enough dancers by November 15 we will cancel the dance.  Our caller and cuer will each be coming from a long distance and staying overnight.  Let's make it worth their efforts to travel to Baker City for us.

We encourage everyone to support the Star Promenaders dances and workshops in La Grande.

If you have not yet done so please mark your calendars with:
November 21, 2015 with Jim Swanson calling squares and Zina Rapp cueing rounds
March 19, 2016 with Bill & Neva Reid calling and cueing
April 22 & 23, 2016 Spring Fling Festival

See you in a square,

Richard Rubicam
