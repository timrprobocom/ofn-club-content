A square of Valley River Dancers traveled to San Diego to surprise  Randy Dibble, who was featured caller at Festival de la Cuadrilla. Some flew, some drove, and all declared it was worth the effort just to see Randy's jaw drop.

Our Nov. 24 Gospel Dance (always the Friday after Thanksgiving) is one of our most popular and well attended special dances. We are grateful for all of the dancers who join us for some ol' time religion music -- and the opportunity to dance away some Thanksgiving calories.

Plus and Advanced dancers: Join us New Years Eve at Maplewood Grange. Say hello to 2016 by dancing plus, with every third tip A2. The festivities start at 8 pm and we will be serving dessert in addition to open break and a toast at midnight. Tickets are $8 and available at the door.
