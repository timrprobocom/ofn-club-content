Hard to believe Thanksgiving and the holidays are here already. Here is
wishing you and your family a wonderful time together. Time goes by so
fast when we are having fun and dancing and visiting friends.
<p>
Thank you to all the clubs and delegates who sent in their insurance
paperwork. This was a good year for insurance. Everyone sent their
paperwork in on time (or at least close enough). That makes my job as
insurance chairman a lot easier.
<p>
I did not receive any questions this month other than insurance. So
remember if you have a question or suggestion, send it in and we will
try to accommodate.
<p>
Happy Thanksgiving!
