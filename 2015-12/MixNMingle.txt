Our 31st birthday dance was a fun event with Randy Dibble calling and Jeanine Norden cuing.  Dan decorated the cake with M&Ms (the candy kind) marking 31.  By coincidence, the ice cream and the chocolate cake celebrated my birthday, too.  (Even my grandchildren are older than 31.)  What better way to celebrate a birthday than dancing with friends?  (And dining out with family.)  

All food brought to our December 19th dance will go to the Oregon Food Bank.  We are hoping for bountiful of donations for the hungry.

Happy Christmas to all!
