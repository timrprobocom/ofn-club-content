With 3 scheduled dances, December will be an active month for the Happy Hoppers.

In an effort to provide our Mainstream students with some Happy Hopper floor time, on December 5, we will have a "Mainstream Splurge" dance.  The format for this dance will be Plus tips from 7:00 to 8:00, and Mainstream tips for the rest of the evening from 8:00 to 10:30.  Callers will be Jim Hattrick and Darrell Kalmbach; Dorothy Lowder will be cueing.  

On December 19, we will have our annual Christmas dance, with all singing calls.  Pre-rounds will start at 7:30, with Plus tips from 8:00 to 10:30.  Jim Hattrick will be calling and cueing.

Our annual New Year's Eve dance is themed as "The Wild West".  A buffet dinner will be served at 7:30.  Plus tips start at 8:30.  The Front Porch Trio (Jim Hattrick, Craig Abercrombie, and Adam Christman) will "bring order" to the festivities.  At midnight, Jim will offer a toast to the New Year.

For the first 2 dances this month, we are re-visiting our annual Christmas Toy Drive.  Please bring unwrapped toys for us to donate as presents for kids in need.

Because the first Saturday in January is so soon after out New Year's Eve Dance, we'll be dark on January 2, 2016.

We work hard to make our education program a comfortable environment for students.  Many of our club members volunteer as "Angels" to help make it an easy and productive experience.  We encourage beginning dancers to start introductory lessons on the first Monday of every month at 7:30.  We are committed to serving both beginners and continuing students with our lesson format.  Every Monday, Plus lessons will be given at 6:30, Basic lessons start at 7:30, and Mainstream lessons are available at 9:00.
