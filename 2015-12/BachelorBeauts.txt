The Pine Forest Grange was filled with delicious food and laughter on a recent Wednesday night when the Bachelor Beauts hosted a Thanksgiving feast for 82 Central Oregon dancers and their families. Ron Bliven, who recently retired as club caller for the Bachelor Beauts and the Swinging Mountaineers received a standing ovation as he and his wife Terry were presented with a lifetime membership in both clubs.Throughout his 50-year career as a caller, Ron has shared his good humor and love of square dance with many dancers.  And, Terry has added a joyous presence at dances and lessons with her encouraging guidance as a partner on the dance floor. Hats off to a couple that has contributed so much to square dancing in Oregon!
