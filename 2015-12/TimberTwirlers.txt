Our annual Pirate Dance was great and was attended by some very dangerous looking characters. This dancing year is looking like another great one. 

Our caller Bruce Lowther fell and damaged his Rotator Cup and had to have surgery, which put him out of commission for awhile but he is recovering nicely.

November 29 we will be hosting the first New Dancers Dance for the Mid-Willamette Area (see flyer in the OFN), which is always so much fun. We will be dancing at the Eagles in Albany.

December will bring lots of great Christmas songs and colorful Christmas outfits. Love that time of year. Be sure to join us every first and third Fridays of every month at the IOOF hall, 738 SE 5th in Albany. Sandy
