October was a busy month for us.  The Sunset Promenaders welcomed twenty seven Eager Beavers on the 3rd for a visitation enjoyed by all.  On Sunday October 11th, our group had the pleasure of dancing to The Crew with the Golden Squares in Woodburn.  Then a bunch danced at the Seaside Sashay the following weekend.  Karen and Ferrous Steinka received recognition from the stage for selling the most ribbons for the event.

December may be the holiday month but December 7th, Pearl Harbor Day, is a day to 
remember for the veterans of WWII and those of us who were alive and were shocked into action.  During the celebrations remember our veterans.  Hope you all have holiday celebrations planned with family and friends.

As a reminder we have a new line of callers and cuers for our Monday dances.  On 1st & 5th Mondays - Daryl Clendenin & Yvonne Clendenin, on 2nd & 4th Mondays - Daryl Kalmbach & Joyce Hooper, and on 3rd Mondays - Jim Hattrick.

All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons: Rounds 1:00 - 1:30; Plus 1:30 - 3:15 PM, Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
