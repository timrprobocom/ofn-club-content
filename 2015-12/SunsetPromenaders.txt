Sunset Promenaders Club had their 30th Anniversary Dinner and Dance on October 3rd.  We had Dan Preedy from Spokane calling, and Ken Pratt cueing.  There was a ham dinner before the dance and desserts at an open break during the dance.  There were 104 dancers filling the floor.  Thank you all you guests, it was a fun time.

Then on the third Saturday the Club was dark because of the Seaside Sashay being on the same weekend.  The Sashay was a big success with dancers from Washington and Oregon.  Daryl Clendenin and Chuck Garner were the Callers and Debbie Taylor the Cuer.  The weather was “iffy” at times but turned out pretty good overall.  The Festival is organized and put on by the Hayshakers of Astoria and the Sunset Promenaders of Hillsboro clubs each year.  Thank you to all the dancers that came to the festival.

On December 5th we will have a mainstream dance with Mike Stout calling and Ken Pratt cueing.  Then, on December 19th is the Club’s Christmas Dance with Mike and Ken calling and cueing.

The first and third Thursdays of December, 3rd and 17th, are the clubs Promenaders Plus Dances.  Darrell Kalmbach and Ken Pratt are doing a great job calling and cueing.  There will not be a dance on the fifth Thursday as that is New Year’s Eve and there will be a TVC dinner and dance that night.

The Sunset Promenaders wish all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
