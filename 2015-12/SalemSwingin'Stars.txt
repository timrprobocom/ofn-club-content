Many thanks to all the dancers who attended our 5th Friday Spooktackular Plus Dance on October 30. We had a blast, with seven squares dancing, lots of costumes and candy. It was a great evening. A big shout out to all of you who came and helped get the Square Dance Center in Halloween Fashion.

Join us for our NEW DANCER DANCE on Friday December 4. Jeanine Norden will cue Pre-Rounds at 7:00 and Randy Dibble will call Plus at 7:30 and Mainstream starts at 8:00 pm. Our regular dance will be on December 18.

Special Note: We will be DARK on Friday January 1 to enjoy New Year's Day and also on Friday January 29 as we will be at Mid-Winter in Albany. See you on the dance floor.
