In December we have Roger Putzler calling for us both dances.  We dance the first and third Saturdays. The first Saturday of December is our regular dance with Roger Putzler calling and Christina Corelli cueing.

December 19 we are combining with Whirl-A-Ways for a special Christmas dance with Roger Putzler, Mike Kious and Christina Corelli.  That should be a lot of FUN! 
 
We are dark January 2, but a lot of us plan to be at the hall New Year's Eve to ring in 2016!  Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli are putting on a Two Dollar Dance for New Year's Eve.  Dancers are encouraged to bring pies.  The first year they did this they had 11 squares and 33 pies! 
 
Keep on dancing,
Christina Corelli
