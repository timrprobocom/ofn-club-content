October was a busy month for the Buckeroos! We enjoyed our dance on October 3rd with Dale Roberson calling. There were several squares and everyone had a great time. On October 17th, we had our Halloween Hoedown with Don Marshall calling. There were many great costumes and the barn was decorated for the occasion.

Almost two squares of Buckeroos went on a visitation to Sets in Order for their 69th birthday dance. Our own Dale Roberson was the caller for the big event. Later in the month another visitation was made to the Beachcombers in Port Orford. Ray Graves, a past Buckeroo, was calling the dance that evening. We had almost a full square. The dance had dancers of all abilities having fun together.

We are gearing up for our big wreath project in the coming weeks. This is our biggest fundraiser of the year. If you are in the area, make sure you make arrangements to pick one up! 

We will be dancing on the 11th of November in the Veteran’s Day Parade in Roseburg…we hope to see you there! We also hope that you can join us for our Harvest dance and potluck on November 17th!

Happy dancing!
