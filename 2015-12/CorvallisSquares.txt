We had a festive and well-attended Halloween Dance on October 24. Our mainstream lessons are going well under Bruce and Judy's excellent guidance, and we have half a dozen enthusiastic new dancers. We look forward to the start of the Area New Dancers' Dances. 

We were dark in November in order to be able to attend other dances, so are excited about December when we're holding our Christmas Dance and will also host a New Year's Dance. We're also looking forward to dancing in the New Year! Wishing Happy Holidays to all! Karen
