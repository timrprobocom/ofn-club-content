Willamette Squares celebrated their birthday with their 21st. birthday dance. Birthday and Halloween themed songs, decorations, and food were the focus of this lively dance! 

Square dance lessons are in full swing and the progress is evident each week. Thanks to the angels who come and help. There is always room for more angels if anyone else would like to join us on Sunday evenings at the SSDC.

We are looking forward to our annual Thanksgiving dance and dinner. We are reminded to be thankful for the food set before us and that we are given the opportunity to experience fellowship through square dancing. Jodee Howard
