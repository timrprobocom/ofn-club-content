The Milton-Freewater Muddy Frogs are having fun with the mainstream class with Bill Reid calling and with a good group in the jive/swing social ballroom class taught by Neva Reid. 

December will bring our Christmas dance Sunday afternoon, December 20, from 3:00-5:00 at the Community Building in Milton-Freewater called by Bill and cued by Neva.  There will be a turkey dinner immediately afterwards.  The turkey will be furnished, so bring something good to go along with it.

December 31 will find us once again getting together with the Walla Walla Family-a-Fair club for a bang-up New Year’s Eve party, this time ending with breakfast cooked at the hall!  This is always a very special evening.  We hope to see you there!

Keep on dancin’!
