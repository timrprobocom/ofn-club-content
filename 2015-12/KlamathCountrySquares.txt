Thank you to the Herndons for hosting the Christmas Celebration and general membership meeting December 19. Rounds with Sarge Glidewell and multi-level squares with Larry Sprout.

We had lots of good food and good fun visiting with current club members, former dancers, new dancers, and friends and family members at our Thanks~Giving Dance in November as well.

Thanks to the nominating committee, and to a group of loyal and willing members, our club has a good slate of officers to install for 2016. 

Several KC members are looking forward to dancing with friends old and new at Mid-Winter....Hope to see you there.
