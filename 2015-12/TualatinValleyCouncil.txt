On October 31st, Halloween night, the annual Tri Council Dance was held at the Clark County Square Dance Center in Vancouver.  As you may recall, that day, and night, was a rain filled adventure for any of those who decided to brave the elements.  One would expect the Portland Area Council (PAC) to have the best attendance since the PAC was the host Council this year.  If not the PAC then surely the Evergreen Council would have a bunch since the venue is in their back yard.  But, it turns out the TVC had the greatest number of dancers in attendance at this fun packed evening called by Darrell Kalmbach and cued by Molly Combs.

The next Council event will be our annual New Yearâ€™s Eve dance on December 31st, held at the IOOF Hall, 267 East Main Street, Hillsboro, OR 97123.  Doug Davis is the featured caller with Randy Lewis cueing.  This is a ticket sale dance.  They can be purchased in advance through TVC officers, or club delegates at each of the TVC clubs.  Ticket sales are going well so you need to get yours soon.  The evening will begin with a lasagna dinner at 7:30 with dancing from 8:30PM until about 12:15AM.  Every 3rd tip will be Plus followed by intermediate rounds.  One tip will be called after midnight.  Ticket costs: $13 per person.
