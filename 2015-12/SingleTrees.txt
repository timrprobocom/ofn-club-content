Single Trees had very two very successful dances with terrific guest callers in October.

Our first dance on the second Friday was called by Richard Lane.  He has such a great sense of humor and calls some very interesting moves.  Jackie Gale cued her best that night too.  What a great combination.  We had several guests in attendance from very far afield. 

Our Halloween Dance was called by Scott Zinser who always calls a great dance for us.  He taught us some new combinations and kept everyone on their toes.  There were many crazy costumes among our guests and members.  We had four winners: Sharon Hahn, our host for October, Gaynor Hintz, Janet Geiger and Shirley Marc.  What happened to the guys this year?

On Oct. 31 the CCCA hosted a Halloween dance at the hall to which we made a visitation.  Talk about zany costumes!  Wow!  There was a mystery "prisoner" there that no one seemed to know.  He/she disappeared before we could find out who it was.  Great fun dancing to Roger Putzler and all the other callers and want-to-be callers who had attended his latest caller school.  We were all delighted to see how well Janet Geiger is doing.  We may have a fledgling caller in our midst!

We are looking forward to a great dance on Dec. 11 called by Jim Voll and also to the combined Christmas Dance on the 19th which will be called by Roger Putzler and Mike Kious.
