The Central Oregon Council held a Halloween Dance on October 31st enjoying the calling of Richard Lane and cueing of Dave Cooper.  The event was held in an old Grange in Alfalfa, a rural community east of Bend.  Mavericks Round Dance and  Sagebrush Shuffler Square Dance Clubs co-sponsored the event.  Great costumes and good food made the day a special event.
