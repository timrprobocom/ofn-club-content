On October 9th the club was found resting up from the R Square D Annual October-Fest by having a Pajama Dance with cold cereal and milk for a snack at the break after the dance.  On the October-Fest weekend, we had 93 dancers on Friday and 96 on Saturday, and we really thank all for this wonderful turnout.

Wow! What a busy month it has been; the club came to the end of the month with a Heritage Dance on the 24th of October.  We had several visiting clubs including the Haylofters, Cougar Squares, Ruff and Ruffles, and the Stardust Dancers.

The club is ready for the holiday season and will have a Toy Dance on the 11th of December with toys being collected and given out where needed.  We will round out December with a New Yearâ€™s Eve Dance co-sponsored with us and Ruff & Ruffles at the Catlin Grange on Shannee St. in west Kelso.  We invite you to come and dance with us.
