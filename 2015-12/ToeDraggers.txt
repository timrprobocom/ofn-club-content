Getting out on visitations sure makes square dancing a great way to meet new and old friends.  We had 3 in October.  The Columbia River Dancers tried to kidnap KC and Bev if we didn’t have at least 1 square of our dancers at their dance.  We out did ourselves and enjoyed taking KC, Bev and their spouses home again to continue our year of dancing with the Toes.

Another unusual activity we took part in, in October, was having our lessons at Twin Oaks Air Park because our grange was busy on lesson night.  Thanks Bob and Betty Stark for letting us dance around your airplane for an evening.

Come on down and join us in celebrating our Giving Thanks Dance November 6th.  Dinner will be served at 6:30 PM, a spaghetti feed.  Also remember our canned food drive is for the entire month of November and we would love your help to make our food barrels overflowing for families in the community that are in need.

We are collecting new toys for the month of December at both dances.  Our first dance on December 4th is the all singing calls night with Rocking Around the Square.  It should be a fun one and the 18th is our regular second dance of the month.

Our new students have been working hard with their lessons and are looking forward to our Holiday Square Dance Party, on Saturday, December 12th from 2 to 4 PM.  We will have a delicious ham and pot luck dinner downstairs at the hall afterwards at 4:15 PM.  It’s our B 51 dance and all new students and all square dancers are invited.  We are having a cookie exchange for anyone that wants to bring 2 dozen cookies and the recipe in exchange for another set of cookies.  Yum.  See you in a square.
