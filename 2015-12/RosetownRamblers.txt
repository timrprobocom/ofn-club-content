Our annual all-weekend dance extravaganza on October 23-25 was a huge success. In addition to 15 hours of dancing over 2½ days, we squeezed in a harvest feast, Sunday brunch, and costume contest, including guest appearances by Mickey and Minnie Mouse and two officers from Star Trek. Yes, it was an interspecies and intergalactic gala! Thanks to all who supported our event, including large contingents from Valley Squares, Puddletown Squares (Seattle), Squares Across the Border (Vancouver BC), and Spin Cycle Squares (Eugene). Next year, we plan to hold our event on Halloween weekend, so mark your calendars for October 29-31, 2016, and watch our website for details.
 
On November 7, we returned to the Milwaukie Grange for a Psychedelic Dance Party. The joint was jumping as Gary Monday’s high-energy, fast-paced calling style brightened a damp and chilly evening. We were thrilled to welcome an enthusiastic group of Bachelors and Bachelorettes, who earned back a banner that our club had received at a visitation in July.
 
Your next chance to experience the Ramblers’ unique dance style and hospitality will Saturday, December 5 at the Milwaukie Grange from 7-9:30 pm. Our theme will be Snowflakes and Rainbows. Our caller will be the world-renowned Anne Uebelacker from British Columbia. Anne has called throughout the US and Canada, and in many other countries around the world. This is an opportunity to dance with one of the greats.  We hope to see you there!
 
SYIAS!
