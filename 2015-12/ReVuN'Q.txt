The club continues to work on waltz movements to make our dancing look better and flow smoother. We have some ideas floating around for what to do after the first of the year and will discuss them soon to get information out by word of mouth so we can continue our lessons by doing something constructive with our time.

We had a good Halloween dance with lots of goodies to eat. Even had a plate of worms coming out of something brown that earned the owner their door entry money returned for a prize. The costumes brought a bunch of gangster-type people to dance with us and that added to the fun.

We will be dark on Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve, but will have a fun dance on New Year’s Eve with a flyer to come soon. Come and join us for a nice evening of dancing phase 3-4 and some easy 5’s. Dress up pretty as there will be a photo booth available to record your outfit and entry into 2016 on a good note. 

We are looking forward to some good evenings of fun and friendship. Marilyn Schmit
