Tri Squares is currently on its 7th week of lessons as of November 1st.  Students are working hard and looking forward to upcoming dancing opportunities.  On December 5th, Tri Squares will be hosting a new dancerâ€™s jamboree!  We encourage all clubs to please bring your students.  This will be a great opportunity for fellowship and floor time.  The dance will be the first 51 moves.  We look forward to seeing new faces at our jamboree.  

During the month of December our dance dates will be on December 5th (Basic 51) and December 18th.  On December 18th we will be raffling off a turkey!  Make sure to show up ready to dance followed by fun and friendship!  Our dance schedules starts at 7:30 PM, beginning with 15 minutes of pre-rounds and 15 minutes of plus.  Then at 8 PM we will start mainstream with every fourth tip plus.  

See you at the dance!
