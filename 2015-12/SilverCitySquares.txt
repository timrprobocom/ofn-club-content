Lessons have been going ok for us with eight students including three groups of fathers/daughters among them.

Our November dance was a bit different as we did a ham dinner instead of a turkey dinner. Those who came enjoyed the dinner and the dance.

Our youth are going to the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival again in May. It will be in Langley BC again this year. The kids do have festival pins to sell as well as raffle tickets. The raffle drawing will be in March at their fundraising dance.

My dad (Mathew Buchheit) is turning 50 this month and his birthday is actually on our dance night (December 11). Our club is planning to tease him a bit so please come out and join us for the fun!  Petrina Buchheit
