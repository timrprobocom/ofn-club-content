Five squares of dancers attended the MWA Fall Festival on Oct. 31. Some dancers wore Halloween costumes and others chose to wear either casual clothes or traditional square dance attire. Timber Twirlers were hosts for the event and did a super job. Thank you to the Timber Twirlers and all the dancers who came to support the MWA Fall fund raiser.
