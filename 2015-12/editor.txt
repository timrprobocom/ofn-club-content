You may not have noticed that the main Federation web page at
<a href="http://squaredance.gen.or.us/">squaredance.gen.or.us</a>
now has a Google search option at the top that lets you search 
everything on the Federation web site, including the past online OFNs.
This is a very handy little tool.
<p>
I have received one or two inquiries about getting the OFN in printed form.
What you are reading here is just an ordinary web page, and can be printed
like any other web page.  It ends up being a LOT of pages, but it can
be printed.

Still looking for someone to do a "Solo Corner" monthly column, with news 
and items of interest to the single square dancer.  If you are interested 
let me know.

Do you have your New Year's Eve tickets yet?  Lots of clubs and councils 
are holding New Year's Eve dances, and they often sell out because of
their popularity.
