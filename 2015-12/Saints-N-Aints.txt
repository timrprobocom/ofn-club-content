Saints-n-Aints want to wish everyone a happy and safe holiday.  We will be hosting a New Yearâ€™s Eve dance this year so if you are in the area please come join us. 

Class is doing well and we hope to have new dancers ready to join in the fun at Mid-Winter in January.  We are also doing a Plus class right before our Beginnerâ€™s Class on Sundays from 2:30 â€&ldquo; 4:00 PM.
