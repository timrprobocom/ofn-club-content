For several months, our council has been asking our domain clubs how we may help them.  And it’s time for our council to let our clubs know how they may help us (and themselves.)

The Burgerville™ chain has a program wherein a club can deliver meals to tables and they will donate 10% of their proceeds to a non-profit.  What better non-proft than ourselves!  We would propose the club keeping half the money for themselves, and give half to our council.  Few non-profits can go indefinitely without some sort of fund raising events, and this would seem to be a very generous offer.  We have asked all of our domain clubs to contact their local Burgerville™.

Another of our ideas centers on our clubs’ sharing when their special dances will be, so that there are not two special dances happening the same night.  Having conflicting dances takes away attendance from both dances.  An extension of this would be the recent Seaside Sashay with the Country Cut-Up breakfast.  This could have been avoided through more communication with our neighboring TVC council. The Evergreen Council would also need our attention so that our council is not in conflict with their Evergreen Council.
