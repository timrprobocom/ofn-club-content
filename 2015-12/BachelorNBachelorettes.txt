What an amazing time we had at the Rosetown Ramblers on our second visitation Nov 7th.  Here is a club which had no banner!  They said they didn’t need a banner because they never get any club visitations. We told them they had about six weeks to get one together before we came a knockin’ again.  And come Nov 7th, they had a new club banner proudly on display.  It was a great time with Gary Monday, a national caller who doesn’t get down here all that often.
