October was a busy month! We visited Silver City Squares on Oct. 9 and discovered the teens are a real challenge to keep up with! Itâ€™s no wonder they keep winning trophies. We brought back a really old club banner, too. 

Our 'Ghoul Dance' on October 17 was our own chance to don costumes and express our inner ghoul or whoever. Finally, the MWA Dance fell on Halloween so out came the costumes again and three couples from our club attended that dance. This was a fun evening with five squares on the floor and lots of clever costumes, callers and cuers and just fun people.

We are looking forward to our December dance as we will be welcoming the MWA new dancers. Experienced clothing will also be available for purchase. Keep dancing and we hope to see you in a square, somewhere. Carmen
