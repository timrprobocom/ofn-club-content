The Capitol Callers and Cuers Association is an organization consisting of square dance callers and round dance cuers and their partners. We work together to improve our skills and promote square and round dancing in the Mid-Willamette Valley area. We meet on the third Sunday of the month from September through May for a business meeting with education. Guests are welcome. Meetings are from 1:30 to approximately 3:30 at the Salem Square Dance Center, 3695 45th Ave. NE, Salem, Oregon 97305

The Capitol Callers and Cuers Association sponsors at least two (2) dances a year, a New Dancer Dance the third (3rd) Sunday in December, and a Spring Carnival on the first fifth (5th) Saturday in the Spring.  The Club features our Association members to call and cue at these dances. Judy Russell
