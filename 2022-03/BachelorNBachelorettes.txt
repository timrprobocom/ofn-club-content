Our students have graduated and we’re launched for another fiscal year.

Our president still believes there are too many clubs for the number of dancers we have.  In that light, we are always looking for clubs that would like to merge with us, or have us merge with them.  This will combine talent, resources and dancers to continue the hobby we so much love.

April 29th, we will be hosting our council dance at Abernethy Grange.  It will feature Sarge and Cece Glidwell, the caller and cuer for the Klamath Country Squares.  It’s really a treat to welcome and dance to entertainment who doesn’t usually come up this way.
