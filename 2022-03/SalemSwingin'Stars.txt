Our Annual Wear Red dance was awash in various shades of red on February 4. George Hermann was our guest Caller and Rikki Lobato was our guest Cuer.

On February 5 we lost a great member of our club, Danny Rickard, who passed away quietly that morning with family and friends surrounding him. Danny was the inspiration of the Chicken at our Annual Corn and Cluck dances. Danny went all out on the decorations for our Annual Hobo dances. He was the Membership Chair for many years and his love for square dancing was evident. He spent time placing flyers and talking to people, encouraging them to give it a try. Danny had a great smile and infectious spirit. He will be missed by all who knew and loved him. We are all praying for his wife, Lanie and family as they navigate the coming days without him. Watch our Facebook page for details on the funeral to held in March.

Rikki Lobato will be our Guest Cuer on our February 18 dance. Our March dances are March 4 and March 18. On March 18 we will celebrate St. Patrick's Day, so wear your green. Sheila Machado
