We graduated thirteen youth just before Mid-Winter Festival and eight of our new graduates attended the Festival. We are looking at doing a second set of lessons but it depends on how many students we get. If we don't get enough, we will continue with Tuesdays as practice and dance time.

The Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival has been cancelled again this year. BUT Silver City Squares is going to be hosting a Teen Square Up May 6-8, 2022, at Waldo Hills Community Club. This will be youth dancing and a mini competition. The details are still being worked out. Watch for flyers and club reports. If you have youth who might be interested, get ahold of Karyn Buchheit.

We have also gone to two dances a month. Watch our flyers for definite dates for our second dance of the month. 

Our youth will be having a Fundraiser Dance on March 6, 2022, to help raise funds to host our Teen Square Up. We will be dancing 2:00-5:00 p.m. with a silent auction, raffle baskets, cash raffle and a brunch. Brunch will be served from 1:00-2:00 p.m. Petrina Buchheit
