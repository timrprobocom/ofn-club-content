Our beginner class participants that started in the Fall have now graduated and we are pleased to announce that there were six of them that continued with classes after the first of the year. We are glad to have them as members of our club. However, we are saddened by the fact that our beginner instructor, Grace Allen, moved out of the area so she is no longer with us. Mary Bray, one of our original founders of the club back in
1989, has stepped back in to teach this class. Mary taught all levels of clogging for many years and then took a hiatus to raise her family. She is now retired and has returned to help. She is energetic, engaging, and humorous and we love having her back.

The club also hosted the "Stamp Out Winter Workshop" Saturday February 12 at the Square Dance Center. It was sponsored by the Northwest Clogging Association and we had several very talented instructors from Washington and Oregon. It was nice to have a workshop in our own backyard.
