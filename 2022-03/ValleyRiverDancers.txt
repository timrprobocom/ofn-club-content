 Our Mainstream lessons have been put on hold because of students who came down with Covid and an injury, so we plan to resume lessons in March.
 Our Dances will continue to be held on the 2nd Fridays of March for Plus and the 4th Fridays of March for Mainstream.  Masks and proof of vaccination are required.
 Dances will be at the Newberg Chehalem Community Center in Newberg.
