 R Square D’s “Back in the Saddle Again!” dance was January 14th and we had 4½ squares in attendance.  It was great fun seeing dance friends whom we hadn’t been able to dance with for almost two years!  Huge thanks to a large group from Columbia River Dancers and also to Cougar Squares members and others who are faithful in supporting our club.  We danced again on January 22nd and enjoyed Craig’s calling and Susan’s cueing to the theme of “Snowflake Sashay”.  Thankfully, we didn’t see any snowflakes that evening!
 Our beginner’s class has 12 students who are returning each week for lessons.  Their enthusiasm is contagious!  We are continuing plus lessons/workshops at 6:30 PM on Wednesday evenings (prior to the beginner’s class).  Our club caller, Craig Abercrombie, is going to Arizona in late February to attend Mariners’ spring training games and Jim Hattrick will teach our lessons while Craig is away.  
 A class level dance is scheduled for Friday, March 11th with guest caller Jim Hattrick and Susan Healea cueing rounds.  Our Spring Celebration dance is Saturday, March 26th, again with Jim Hattrick as our guest caller and Susan as cuer.  Our dances begin with plus dancing and intermediate rounds at 7:00 and mainstream from 8-9:30 (on March 11th it will be class level calling after the plus hour).  
 R Square D dances at Kelso Senior Center, 108 NW 8th Ave, Kelso, WA.  We do not require proof of vaccination but face masks are required (face shields are not allowed in place of masks in WA State).
