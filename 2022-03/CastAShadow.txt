At this point in time we are still not dancing but waiting for the pandemic to die down.  As the Governor and OHA will be lifting the indoor masking mandate as of March 31, 2022, we might anticipate a return to dancing by our advanced group at the Emerald Square Dance Center in Hall B from 1:30-3:30PM one to two Sundays a month.  Letâ€™s hope so.

We dance to recorded music but do have a live caller every once in a while.  We generally have between 1 and 2 squares of dancers and use cards so everyone has a chance to dance whether they have a partner or not.  All advanced level dancers are welcome to join us when we start dancing again.  Please keep an eye on our website where Fred Beisse posts the schedule of dances: cas-sd.yolasite.com.

Hope to see you in a square soon,
Gaynor Hintz
