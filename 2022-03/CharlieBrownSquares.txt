Charlie Brown Squares

We started a new SSD class and have a fun group learning!! We are still doing mainstream and plus FunShops on Thursdays and can always use more dancers!
Our next dance is February 19th with Pre rounds at 7pm with Rikki and alternating plus and Mainstream starting at 730pm with Chuck.  Our March dances are on the 5th & 19th. On the 5th we will "Feed The Need" with guest caller/cuer Phil Ramey & Sarge Glidewell. We will also be collecting canned goods for the local food bank.  On the 19th, we have J Domis & Bob Dingman who will be ready to "Clover on Over." J is is a local caller who we are always thrilled to get to call a dance or two for us - he's has a great energy & personality!

Boatnik is fast approaching and we are excited to be having the festival this year during Memorial weekend. Featured talent includes caller Eric Henerlau and cuer Dan Drumheller. Get your ribbons!!

See you on the dance floor soon!!
