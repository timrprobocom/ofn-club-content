 I’m happy to report that we had a very fun dance the last Friday in January.  The festivities were all centered around the theme “Alice in Wonderland”.  The Cheshire Cat (aka Kathy Roberts) and her handsome escort, The Mad Hatter (aka Tim Roberts) made a dashing couple!
 We are very thankful to the many clubs that visited, and to the wonderful calling of KC/Linda Curtis, & Darrell Kalmbach/Erin, and the lively cueing of Tammy Helms, and Tim Keck.  We had 2 squares on the floor most of the evening.
 Toe’s will be dark for the month of March.  More news on when we might be stating back up in my next report.
 Take care.
