 Valley Squares March 19 dance, 7-9 pm at the Aloha Grange.  Scott Zinser will be our Caller, Connie Clark our Cuer.  Come join us and enjoy Scott's calling and Connie's cueing.  At the date I write this report, our class is expected to be finished by the end of February.  We invited our students to attend our February 19 dance.  We have been having a great time in our classes, Craig has kept us moving and learning.  Our dances will be at dancer level, which will be Mainstream.  We will include some Plus as well. 
 Come join us.
