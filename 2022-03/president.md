March brings spring. Flowers blooming, birds singing, allergies allerging (??) and, hopefully, warmer temperatures. The Mid-Winter festival is past with a larger attendance than anticipated. It was good to see a lot of friends back out dancing. I could tell that a lot of people just wanted to get out and socialize. The only major problem I heard of was the power going out on Thursday night during the Trail’s End dance. That was rectified fairly quickly and dancing resumed.

March may also bring an end to the indoor mask mandate. That is really good news for our activity and hopefully will make it so more people will come out and dance. I have a new singing call that I will premiere at my March 5th IWW dance.  It is called “There’s a Bright Big Beautiful Tomorrow”.  These past two years have been really hard on our “sport” and this song has a very optimistic outlook on life. I think it is just what we need while we are suffering from Covid “fatigue”. 

Hope to see you in a square soon and…..

Let’s Get Back to Dancing
