### Coronavirus Update

The coronavirus situation is very fluid.  The state-wide indoor mask mandate is still in effect in Oregon, but is set to expire at the end of March.  As always, it is up to each individual club and facility to decide what restrictions make them comfortable.  Please honor their wishes.
