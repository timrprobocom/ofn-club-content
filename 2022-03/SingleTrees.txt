We have been dancing most months since last May but up until February we only danced once a month on the 4th Friday.  We did not dance the 4tgh Friday in January because of Mid-Winter.  Because we are the only dance club dancing regularly in our area, our members decided that until the Buccaneer club or the Whirl-A-Ways start up their dances we will offer two dances a month on the 2nd and 4th Fridays. The club also voted to temporarily increase our door fee to $8 per person as we are only getting about two squares at our dances.  Once our numbers increase back to normal or until we can drop to only one dance a month that rate will be in effect.  

We dance starting with 15 minutes of pre-rounds at 7:30 and then a plus tip.  Thereafter we have two mainstream tips with every third tip plus until 10PM.  We offer rounds in between every square dance tip.  Masks are required while the mandate is in effect and no shared food or beverage is encouraged.  Hand sanitizer is put out for all dancers to use in between tips.

I am sorry to announce that we lost one of our Lifetime Members, Gloria Gardner, who had been one of the group to find our square dance hall and help get it purchased for use by our square dancing community.  She served over 20 years on the Hall Board as Treasurer, and was as already mentioned, a Lifetime Member of Single Trees as she first joined in 1997.  Her memorial service will be held Thursday, Feb. 24 at 2PM at Buell Chapel, at 360 6th St., Springfield.

Please come and join us if you can dance at the mainstream level; singles, couples, families are all welcome.  Weâ€™ll have K.C. Curtis and Neil Koozer on March 11 calling and cueing, and Jim Hattrick and possibly Jackie Gale on March 25.  

Hope to have you join us,
Gaynor Hintz
