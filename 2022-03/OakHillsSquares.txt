 The Oak Hills Squares continue to meet every Monday from 6.30-8.30pm, at the Oak Hills Gym on NW 153rd Ave, Beaverton with caller Mark Wheeler.
 We started lessons on January 17th and at this time have 9 new dancers, which is very exciting.  Lessons are on Mondays, from 6.30pm-7.25pm and then we continue with a Mainstream dance. 
 In January we enjoyed a visit from the Tri Squares and Craig Abercrombie who did some calls and sang along with Mark, a very fun night for all.
 We welcome visits from any clubs and dancers, we are a fully vaccinated club and ask for proof of vaccine at your first visit.
 Our thanks again to Craig Abercrombie for stepping in and calling when Mark was unavailable, always entertaining and we learned some new moves.
 Please contact Linda Kitchin: linda@kitchinonline.com for any information about the club.
