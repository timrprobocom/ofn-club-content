 We are continuing to Mainstream 1st and 3rd Saturdays at 7pm.  Also we are dancing  Plus on the 1st and 3rd and 5th Thursday same time, both at the Hillsboro Odd Fellows hall. We have a great turn out for the Plus dances, we had four squares this last Thursday dance.  Averaging 2 1/2 at mainstream dances.
 We also started lessons in January with seven students.  Our lessons start at 4pm till 6pm. We are hoping for a few more next lesson.  So that's a good start.
 Also Tami is having an intermediate round dance Workshop on Sundays at our hall.  They start at 2.30pm till 4 pm.
 We still require masks and vaccinations to dance at our hall.
 Hope to see you soon....
