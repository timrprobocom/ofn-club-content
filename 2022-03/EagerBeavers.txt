 The Eager Beavers began the year with a Centennial Award presentation by the United Square Dancers of American to Paul Swenson, our founder along with his wife, Dottie.  We had four squares in attendance to honor Paul and join in the celebration.
 We ended the month of January with a Black and White dance to add some sparkle to the gray days of winter.
 Congratulations to our own Darrell and Erin Kalmbach for being the recipients of the TVC Recognition Award for 2021.  It was presented to them by TVC President Mike St.Clair at the annual Presidentsâ€™ Appreciation Meeting.  They are very deserving of this honor.
 Our Plus lessons are scheduled to begin on Monday, February 14, from 12:00 noon to 1:15, followed by our regular dance from 1:15 to 3:00.  Darrell Kalmbach will teach the first class, alternating weekly with Jim Hattrick.  This will be a great opportunity for your Mainstream dancers to step up to Plus, as well as an excellent refresher for those who need it.
 We require proof of vaccination along with the required face masks or shields, to ensure the safety of our members and guests.  Please join us on Monday afternoons for fun and fellowship with our excellent caller/cuer teams.
