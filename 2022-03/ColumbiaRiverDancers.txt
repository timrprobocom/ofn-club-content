 The Columbia River Dancers will be celebrating our 7th anniversary with a special dance on Saturday, March 12TH.  We will have Adam Christman from Spokane as our caller that evening.  We usually dance on the 1st and third Fridays so this is a change from our normal routine.  Dangles will be given to the first 50 attendees.  
 Our classes continue on Sundays with beginners at 6 PM.  We usually have mainstream at 7PM but with our smaller classes Jim has been able to move the classes at their pace.  New classes begin the first Sunday of each month.  Watch our website, columbiariverdancers.com for our next beginnerâ€™s dance.  It is coming soon.
 So much has transpired in those seven years.  We have gone from dancing in an YMCA room full of mirrors to a room full of echoes to the Hazel Grange and now to our great home at the Manor Grange.  Most of our time has seen Jim Hattrick as our caller.  We have been with him through his thick and thin.  We consider ourselves fortunate to have a master caller such as Jim. 
 Our club continues to thrive in spite of a long hiatus due to Covid.  We are following Washington State guidelines and require that all dancers wear masks, not shields, that confirm to those guidelines.  At this time we do not have a vaccination requirement.
