 WOW, January was fun!  I saw so many old friends across squares both at Hoedowner dances and at Mid-Winter Festival.  Let’s keep it up.  We began the New Year with a dance on January 8th.  Was there a theme?  No, but warm comfy clothes were suggested.  I didn’t see any gloves, but sweats and sweaters were the norm.  I even saw a knitted hat.  Scott Zinser did his best to keep us warm and moving throughout the night.  Randy Lewis soothed everyone when he called rounds.
 On January 22nd we had a Randy and Randy dance.  Are you mystified?  Randy Dibble challenging us in the squares and Randy Lewis keep us twirling in rounds.  Randy Dibble always makes us THINK!  The man always has a challenge.  Something I know I need more of.  It was a great group of dancers.  A special thanks to the Valley River Dancers who joined us.
 Mid-Winter was a gas!  (Does anyone use that phrase anymore??)  As usual we kicked off the weekend with dinner at Novaks, then off to the Linn County Expo Center.  Our after party was fun and we didn’t even have one complaint about noise.  Saturday saw a full day of new dancers, mainstream, plus, and we even peered in to check out advanced.  The round hall was busy, and we’re always tickled to hear our own Randy Lewis cueing. This year the Showcase of Rounds featured club members Randy Lewis and Debbie Olson along with Sarah Richmond and David Boultinghouse.  Of course, the Hoedowners dined together at the Cascade Grill before dancing and then had a post dance fling Saturday night.  Did we shop? Yes, we did.  Did we win a raffle basket?  Yes, we did.  Did we make memories?  You betcha!
 Please join us for our regularly scheduled dances in March on the 12th and the 26th.  Masks and/or shields are required.
