We haven't been dancing  but hope to return in March.  We are going to have square dance lessons starting in March too.  Look for our flyer coming soon.  Janet Geiger will be calling the first Saturdays and myself Sandy Harris will be calling the 4th Saturdays. 

Hope to see all the dancers joining us soon.
