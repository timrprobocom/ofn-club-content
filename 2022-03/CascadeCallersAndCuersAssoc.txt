Our next scheduled dance is April 30, 2022. Surely, things will have slowed down by then. We're wanting everyone to be safe and feel safe. We are going to assume the mask mandate will still be in effect.  No shared food or drink.  We have hand sanitizers for before and after each tip.  Please bring your own water.  We want to thank all of the dancers for their diligence and support to make this pandemic bearable and short-lived.
