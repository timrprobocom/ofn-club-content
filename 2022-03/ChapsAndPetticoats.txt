Reflecting on the last couple of years, during this era of COVID shutdowns, isolations, event closures, mandates, vaccinations, etc., while some clubs have indeed struggled, even closed, it is comforting to know some events, like Mid-Winter Fest have continuity.  

To all the Mid-Winter Festival (1/28-1/30/2022) Team - Thank you for a much needed weekend of dancing and seeing old and new friends!!

Chaps and Petticoats continue to dance on first and third FRIDAY’s:  March 4th we host a PAC Visitation dance, Scott Zinser and Stephanie Lozano will call and cue, March 18th Mark Wheeler calls and Leonard Snodgrass, indeed, will cue. Our April 1st HIPPIE dance (dress in costume, if you prefer, as all dancers will also judge) opens with Scott Z. doing Plus at 7:30pm and Mark McDonald will entertain us with Rounds…come join us!

Happy Feet,
Betty Chipps
