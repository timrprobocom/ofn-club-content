The club danced once in January and will dance twice in February. We will put plans together for our 62nd birthday dance on the second Saturday of March. Check out the flyers for our dance.
Our presidentâ€™s wife had a heart attack and has had a stent and balloon procedure done. Bonnie and Eugene Ivy will be home to work on getting better and stronger. The club members will help with the set-up of dances until Eugene is ready to come and lead again. 
We had a club meeting and we have changed our fiscal year and month of elections. We had several dates each year when something was due so we combined some of them into a more even renewal time. 
We hope to see some of you at our dances. We enjoy company at our dance hall. Just face masks or face shields are required. Proof of vaccination is not needed. Marilyn
