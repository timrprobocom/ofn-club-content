We continue to dance every second and third Saturday, and also begin lessons in January.

We will be having a new dancers jamboree on Sunday March 13. It will begin at 4 P.M and callers from the floor will be invited to call. Julia Buchheit will be the cuer. 
We will also be having a used square dance attire sale that weekend. It will be a huge sale since we have a whole storage room full of clothes. There will be great bargains galore. The clothing sale will begin before and after our Saturday dance on March 12 and again before and after the new dancer jamboree on Sunday March 13. 

We hope that you will join us for all our fun activities. 
Happy dancing,
Carol Mendenhall
