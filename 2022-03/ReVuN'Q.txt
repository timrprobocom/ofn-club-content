The club finished rumba right before Mid-Winter and we took a week off due to low attendance for the evening. The week after Mid-Winter, we started Jive for those in phase 2 who are ready to move up in rhythms. 
We will start looking for new officers in February and let everyone know that dues will come around in March.
It is time to start the planning process for a spring dance. We will also be hosts for the dance on Thursday of Summer Festival week in July. So we have a couple of events to work on for the future.
We hope your clubs are starting to dance again or shortly will be back on the dance floor. Think positive. Marilyn Schmit
