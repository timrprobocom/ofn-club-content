April 10, 1928 – December 25, 2021 

Lila was born at home near Summit Point, Utah at or about 12:00 am on April 10, 1928.  She was the youngest of five children.  Lila’s family moved to Phoenix, Arizona and then Blythe, California when she was a child.  The family moved to Fall Creek, Oregon where Lila graduated from Lowell High.  After graduation, Lila worked as a telephone operator for two years.  She was married in 1947 and had three children, Karen, Randy, and Doug.  After her divorce, Lila moved to Banks where she worked at the telephone company.  In 1963 she met and married Otis Jones and became the stepmother to five more children.  Since most of the kids were teenagers, Lila quit her job to become a stay-at-home mom.  Lila and Otis had one son, Darren, making them a family of eleven.  Lila was an avid gardener spending a lot of time outside and provided many friends with all the asparagus they could eat over the years.

Lila was also a proficient crafter, knitting afghans for her twenty-six grandchildren (plus many more) and crocheting beautiful doilies, tablecloths and even clothing.  In 1973 Lila and Otis started square dancing and were members of the 4N8ers.  They were charter members of the Sunset Promenaders and Lila continued dancing until she was in her late 80’s.  Not only did she square dance, but Lila was an avid round dancer and clogged for about ten years.  They traveled to every state to attend square dance conventions.  In 1994 Lila and Otis were awarded the TVC Recognition Award and in 2001 they were presented the Randall Award for all their contributions to square dancing in Oregon.  We remember other things like their dedication to being angels at classes, her pies and other potluck dishes and her willingness to help whenever possible.  In August 2021 Lila attended the Sunset Promenaders club picnic visiting with old friends and meeting our new dancers.  Having lived a full good life, Lila passed away December 25, 2021, and will be missed by many for her baking abilities, good humor, and sharp wit.
