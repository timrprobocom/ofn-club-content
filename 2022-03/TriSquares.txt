 A few members of our club have ventured out to visit other clubs since we are still not holding our own dances.  However, at our February board meeting a fresh, new idea was put forth which sounded exciting!  And the board will poll all our members and talk to our caller, Terry Halley, and cuer, Sandra Pinion, to get their input on it.  In any case, Covid numbers are decreasing and we are really hoping to be having refresher lessons and/or dances again within the next few months.  
 I think I may be seeing some daylight at the end of this pandemic tunnel!
