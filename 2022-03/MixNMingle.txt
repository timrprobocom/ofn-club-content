 We are open and dancing!  Masks and proof of vaccination are required.  Come join us on 1st and 3rd Saturdays for rounds with Jeanine starting at 7:30 and Plus squares with Randy starting at 8pm.  We’ve been doing the closing circle at 10pm and if there is anyone wanting to stick around for more dancing, Randy will do one last “overtime” tip.
