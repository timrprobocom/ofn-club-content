 Many of you have danced with R Square D at the Kelso Senior Center.  The main area has a wood floor large enough for (tight) 8 squares.  The kitchen is adjacent and easy for serving in the main room.
 If a club participates on the board of the Center there is a break on the rental fee.  Woohoo!!  Thank you Vic Roberts, President, Dick Sims, Treasurer, Sandy Sims and John Poole for your part on the board.  They help stretch our club finances.
 But the real reason I am telling you this is to tell of the big project some of our members, primarily John Poole, Vic Roberts and Dick Sims have taken on during this pandemic:  There is a second floor to the building with 4 small rooms and 2 large unfinished rooms (unusable) at each end of the building.  These guys, primarily orchestrated by John Poole, have insulated, installed drywall, lighting, painted, added flooring, stairway access carpeted,  and handrails installed.  The rooms are near completion.  When life seems to be at a standstill there are people out there doing significant things like this.
 Kudos to R Square D people who have contributed to this project.
