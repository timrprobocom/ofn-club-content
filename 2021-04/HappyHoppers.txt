Hello out there in Square Dance Land!  We are all so excited to see the trend that is now taking place.  If we can all just keep doing what we've been doing for a little longer and not let our guard down too soon.  We've passed along the news about the B'n'B's opening (sometime soon) for round and line dances.  So they may be seeing some folks from the HH's.  Here in Washington, we are waiting to see how the governor will treat our social dancing.  I've talked to many folks who have had at least one vaccine (moi included).  Everyone is looking forward to more social gatherings and HUGS!!  News from our last board meeting:  we have waived the 21-22 membership fees and will reinstate those who let their membership lapse; we will have our yearly picnic in August if this trend continues.  An update on Jim Hattrick, our most awesome caller.  He has been attending the Let's Keep Hoppin' meetings on zoom and looks really chipper.  He is scheduled to go in for surgery at OHSU on the 30th of this month and it is expected that he will be in there just one day.  As Judy Hattrick said, they are going to blast some stones in his liver and remove a tube that has been in place since November.  Yay!  We will all be thinking of him.  And last but not least, Liza and Tom Halpenny continue to contribute hugely to our mental and physical health with Let's Keep Hoppin' on Monday nights. 
Liza is an inspiring teacher of line dances and folk dances; we laugh at silly jokes, keep up on each other's well-being, dance to Jim's recordings of square dances for one couple and also Buddy Weaver's recordings, and just generally have a very fun hour.  And their generosity extends to one and all---just send Tom a note asking for the zoom invitation.
