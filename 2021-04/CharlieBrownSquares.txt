The Charlie's are still dark and looking forward to when we can dance!! We miss everyone!!
Sadly we've cancelled all April & May dances and events. 
The Boatnik Committee has decided that it would be best to cancel this year's Festival for Memorial Weekend 2021. This was not an easy decision and we were so looking forward to having Jet Roberts and Rey (Sherry) Garza as our featured talent.  We hope to get them for another Festival. 
All we can say is that 2022 is going to be a heck of a party with Eric Henerlau & Dan (Allison) Drumheller. 
We look forward to dancing as soon as we can and hope everyone is staying safe.
See you on the dance floor.
