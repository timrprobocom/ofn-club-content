Well, I must say things are opening up with round dancing and from what I just heard, even a square dance this past weekend.  Getting the vaccine should be a good thing, but it is your choice.  Be cautious in planning for dances in your area and follow the guidelines for the CDC and for your venue.  

I would like to see more club reports in the OFN.  As we all know, there isn’t a lot to read because not much is going on.  I want to point out a couple of special reports from the March issue, written by reporters from the Tualatin Valley Council.  I have strived to write positive reports each month, and these two reports are way better than I could do.  Please go back and reread them.  They are from the Eager Beavers, written by Rachel Nettleton and the Hoedowners, written by Krystal Lass.  This last one lists several good maxims to live by.  Thanks for these good reports.  They made me take notice since they are so positive in a time when we need positivity.

Let us all continue to hold club meetings and make plans to get started dancing.  Our callers and cuers associations are getting ready for this and your club needs to do the same.  That would be a good subject to report on to the OFN next month, so we know what is going on in your area and where to dance when we all get it started again.  We are all in this together and there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
