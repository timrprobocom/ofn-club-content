Even though we did not dance in February, we did get good news at the end of February that the dance hall was going to reopen in March. I sent out an email to the round dancers that they needed to get their dancing shoes on and get their feet used to wearing them. We are scheduled to start on March 11, with some review and then possibly resume the Bolero lessons that we had to stop in mid-stream. Have not heard back from Randy as to what he wants to do. So stay tuned for an update on what was decided. We have several that are anxious to get back to the dance hall and get their dance on!

We survived the ice storm, some without electricity for a few days, and some without internet afterwards. I have been without internet for two weeks now. I have to use my cell phone as a hot spot in order to have internet. I am not a happy camper.

Hope that some of you are back dancing in some capacity during the spring season. Marilyn Schmit
