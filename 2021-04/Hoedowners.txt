 February where did you go?  Four weeks, 28 days and it is gone!  What have the Hoedowners been doing?  We have been searching for vaccine appointments (Moderna, Pfizer, or Johnson and Johnson) and pondering our future.  Hey, Hoedowners we do have one.  The board has been scratching their collective heads, making estimates, planning, watching, debating, and waiting for some breakout information.  The Aloha Grange building can now host larger groups so keep your eye on your email.
 Our future: Jubilation! We are planning our first dances of the year March 13th and 27th.  We are delighted to announce it will be rounds with our cuer, Randy Lewis.  A review or lessons will be at 6 pm.  A variety of music will play from 7-9 pm.  Please come with a partner to comply with covid19 restrictions.  Masks and social distancing required.
 We are planning a campout June 3-6 at the Silver Cove Resort.  Cabins, RV parking and day tripping too.  It will be our big social event of the spring and our first social event in over a year.  We are beside ourselves we are so excited!!
