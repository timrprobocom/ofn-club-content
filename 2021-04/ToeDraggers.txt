The Toe’s are keeping in touch on Zoom, and it is nice to see everyone’s face.  Most are doing well, but there is an underlying vibe saying WE WANT TO GET BACK TO DANCING AND SOCIALISING.  With present info it looks promising for that to happen.
 At the next meeting we will be talking about (SSD) Social Square Dancing.  It’s been successful in Chicago, and it’s being investigated in Oregon now.  Lets hope it is a way to get back to some form of dancing.
 We have a slate of club officers:
 President -Tom & Diana Gray
 Vice President - Cathy Houston
 Treasure - Dan Watson
 Secretary - Kathy Degman
 TVC Delegate - Linda Curtis
 Stay well and we’ll see each other soon
  Kathy Degman
