You’ve heard the saying “no news is good news?  Well, we still long to hear “back to normal,” in all aspects!  

It was a year ago, March 6, 2020, when Chaps and Petticoats had a dance night.  Scott Zinser called and Stephanie Lozano was our Cuer, for the first time.  On March 9th COVID-19 restrictions began, influencing the “Stay home - stay safe.” mandates.  The Club met, outside with masks on, on July 5th, for a Club potluck - super fun it was too:  a warm day, a picnic on the bank of the Willamette River and all members that could turned out (we were still thinking, this too shall pass).  A Christmas potluck was held at a members home on December 13th - only seven members were present: (less than half of our club): two members already had COVID immunity and the other five of us were happy to be a part of the herd - masks off.

That sums up the 2020 year for Chaps and Petticoats, and sadly, we have no dancing news to report, thus far in 2021.  The good news is:  under moderate-risk COVID regulations, our venue, the Maplewood Grange, has opened to small-number meetings, in 2021 - so there is hope.

‘Lessons for all’ will be the theme when our hall re-opens.
