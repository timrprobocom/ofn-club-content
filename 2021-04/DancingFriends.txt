Well, hereâ€™s the current situation with Dancing Friends Round Dance Club.  Douglas County was elevated to Extreme Risk status mid-March.  This put the kibosh on the dancing we had planned and remains in effect until at least March 25 when risk status is re-evaluated. We are hoping for good health for everyone and will happily resume dancing when it is safer to do so.   Our email is:  luvrounddancing@gmail.com  We wish everyone good health and happy dancing!
