Hello everyone,
Not much news to report as far as dancing goes. Like most clubs we are still in a holding pattern due to the pandemic. Our major problem is finding 
 a place to hold dances or classes. We have hopes of starting mid September. The Karuk wellness center seems to be our best option for any type of dancing.in the past the Karuk Tribe was very accommodating and we hope they will be again. We found out that our county fair is back on schedule, to be held in August. This is a great time for us to have our "Pepsi Booth" at the fair. It is a big fundraiser for the club and is a great opportunity to promote upcoming classes. Sherrie and I have been attending Zoom meetings hosted by Daryl Clendenin and attended by callers, dancers, and I think officers of clubs from Oregon. The purpose of these meetings is to try and find new ways to promote square dancing and try to find new ways to re populate this great activity. Suggestions are always welcome, don't be afraid to try something on your own even if it's getting a name and number of a new or even someone thinking of getting back into dancing. I believe the more advertising we can get out there the better! During these meetings there has been a lot of discussion about a revised dance program called SSD ( Social Square Dancing) maybe you have heard of it? It is a shorter lesson plan for new dancers and a possible way to get more dancers in the activity quicker and more often. I am excited and looking forward to trying this out. 
We certainly miss seeing everyone and hope to get back together soon. 
Stay safe and healthy! And if you can " Get shot"
Dean & Sherrie.
