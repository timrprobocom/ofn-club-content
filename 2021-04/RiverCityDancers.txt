It has now been a year since we last danced in our hall. We are all missing dancing and the wonderful fellowship that goes with it.  No one could have guessed we could go this long without dancing. We are all anxiously waiting for the day we can safely gather again.  Our county and city have guidelines that must be met before that will be possible. Safety is also our priority. 

While it has not been possible for us to gather in person yet, we have begun having Zoom meetings to keep in touch and check in with one another.

We send best wishes for good health to all of you and hope we will be dancing together soon.
