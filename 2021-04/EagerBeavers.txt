 It is with great regret I am announcing this is my last report for the Eager Beavers.  At the end of March I am moving to Corvallis to be closer to my youngest daughter who is supposed to keep me out of trouble.  I am not sure she is up to the task.  Things change and sooner or later either you make a change in your life or fate makes a change for you.  Thanks to all of you who have let me know they actually read and enjoy my writing.  I do not think of myself as a writer or reporter.  I try to put words down on paper that I would say to you if I actually talked to you.  This is something I think most people can do.  
 Please keep up your support of your club because you want it to be there for you when we are given the green light to get dancing again.  There are some wonderful dancers who are doing virtual events to keep others active.  Many thanks to all of them.  Also thank those officers who keep in touch with their members and send out their newsletters on a regular basis.  Donâ€™t forget those callers who miss you as much as you miss them.  
 In the meantime sign up for your Covid-19 vaccination as soon as you are eligible.  Sometimes it takes a little work but more sites are coming available.  
 I am sad to say good bye to all the wonderful people I have met square dancing here but at the same time I am looking forward to finding new friends when dancing begins again in Corvallis.  Thanks to everyone who have given such good times in my life.
 Also, check for our start date at www.EagerBeavers.info.
