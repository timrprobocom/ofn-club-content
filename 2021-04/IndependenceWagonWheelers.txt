At a recent board meeting (the first in-person one since last summer), we discussed when we could safely start dancing. It was decided that we want more guidelines before we start. Another meeting will be held in July to make final plans. Since our hall isn't available in August, it is most likely we will start up in September. A decision will also be made in July about if, when and where we will hold lessons. (It has been so long, we all may have to take lessons!) 

IWW is 61 years old this year and we would have celebrated in March. Perhaps we will have a mid-year party! LaVerne
