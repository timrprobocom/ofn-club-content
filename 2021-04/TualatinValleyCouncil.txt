 The second TVC meeting in February via Zoom had 21 participants.  There were fewer problems encountered by those connecting this time, quite a change from last month.  I guess practice makes perfect.  As the meeting began, president Mike St.Clair welcomed two new delegates from the TriSquares, Ursula Kuhn and Carol Roos.
 Most of the clubs reported no activity.  Some are staying connected by newsletters and virtual meetings.  The Hoedowners plan to begin their round dances as soon as the Grange is available.  The Valley River Dancers hope to have their Dancing Under the Stars on the 4th Saturday in July.  More on that at future meetings.
 An ongoing discussion continued regarding the future of our dancing.  The consensus is that we probably will not be dancing until summer, at best.  We discussed the Callerlab square dance program, Social Square Dancing, consisting of 50 moves for Basics and Mainstream.  The dance format may be different in the future but most are in agreement that no plans will be firmed up until we are closer to beginning our activity. 
 The last discussion had to do with electing Council officers for the upcoming year.  Mike suggested that considering very low activity last year that the current officers, if willing and volunteers notwithstanding, continue in their respective positions.  The TVC By Laws will be consulted to see if this is allowed.  If required, there will be a motion to suspend any rule that disallows the continuation at a future meeting.  A motion may then be made for continuation.
