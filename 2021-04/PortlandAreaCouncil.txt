We’re investigating the possibility of having a 5th Friday round dance in April, and there’s a good chance it will be held.  Watch for a flyer in this month’s OFN.

     We are also revising our stipends for callers and cuers at our council dances.  The clubs are free to pay whatever they wish, but our council wishes to pay each caller and cuer 50% of the door, no caps, and a minimum of $75 each.  So on a $6 dance the caller and cuer would each get $1.50 for each dancer, no caps.  Our council believes this more realistically reflects caller/cuer expenses and efforts, and also acknowledges that both caller and cuer contribute equally to the enjoyment of the dance.  Hopefully, callers and cuers will have equal time on stage, since they will be paid the same amount.  Hopefully, too, our member clubs will likewise pay both caller and cuer fairly – to PAC standards.  Door donations may need to increase, but dancing is still a bargain.

     Council elections have resulted in recycling the 2019-20 officers for another year.  Thanks to all.
