 Valley River Dancers had a club meeting on February 12, 2021.  We discussed the hopeful possibility of receiving Covid-19 vaccine immunizations soon.  With that in mind we are hoping to be able to start dancing again in May or June at the Community Center or outside including our special July dance "Dancing under the Stars".  So we feel like things are looking up for our square dance community.
