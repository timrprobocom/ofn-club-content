 Oak Hills Squares is still having a 90-minute zoom call every two weeks while we wait impatiently for the okay to meet again.  Fifteen members participated during the call last Monday evening.  It is always interesting to catch up on what everyone is doing, and an informal agenda has developed:  wearing clothes with a seasonal theme like Valentine Day, a review and recommendation of movies people have watched; a show and tell of craft projects in progress, and a word of the day shared by anyone who wants to do it.  Some recent words:  scurryfunge, which means to hastily tidy a house; snudge – to cheat especially in competition; and zygoma – the cheek bone (kiss my zygoma).  Some folks are meeting to hike the West Side trail, and there was some talk of trying to organize a game night with social distancing and masks.  Members are discussing whether to immediately begin classes when we can meet again, or whether to have a couple of months with just the club members – it’s fun to plan a future with dancing in it!
