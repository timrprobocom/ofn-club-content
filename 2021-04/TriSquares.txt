We continue to have monthly board meetings over Zoom and to discuss when and how we will begin dancing again.  Most likely we'll begin with workshop-type afternoon dances limited to our club-members only, to bring us up to speed before scheduling any regular dances.  Also, use the Zoom meetings for all members to keep up with each other's news.  And of course our monthly newsletter "The Tattler" has been emailed regularly to everyone throughout this whole pandemic. 
 In March over Zoom we had our annual General Meeting to present the names of members running for board positions, and in April we'll hold elections by email, which worked very well last year.  Everyone is so anxious to dance again as soon as it's safe, and we like the idea of dancing to the 50 most-used steps a lot -- but board members are not fond of the potential name of "Social Square Dancing".  We hope that the now-overused word "social" is dropped and that a different name is chosen.
