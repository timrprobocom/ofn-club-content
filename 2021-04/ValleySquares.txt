 At last, Spring is here.  Hope everyone is well and either has had their Covid vaccine or has it scheduled.  
 I have been attending Daryl Clendenin's zoom meeting every other Tuesday at 7 pm.  Pretty much we are discussing the following:  When can we start? (no one knows yet);  How will we start, that's another of the big questions;  What level will we have our classes and dances, another big question; and  Suggest having year round lessons to increase our clubs membership.
 I am suggesting that our TVC Club President's have a zoom meeting and discuss this, then take any suggestions back to their Boards and perhaps members as well.  We all need to be on the same page to continue square dancing and keep it alive.  Don't know when the Club President's zoom discussions will happen or if it will have happened by the time you read this.  We also all need to be on the same page as far as our regular dances are concerned.  Whichever way we go, we need to be consistent.  If we teach our new members the SSD-50 then we need to dance the SSD-50.  We have some time yet and hopefully some great discussions.  It's a new dawn, let's make sure square dancing is still here for us to enjoy in whatever format we choose.
 As far as Plus and beyond is concerned, if we go the SSD-50 route Plus dances will not be changed, but Plus lessons will need to include the calls that were dropped from Basics and Mainstream.  All levels above Plus will not have to adjust.  Let's hope by our next report all this will be settled.  Take a deep breath, enjoy the sunshine, do your Spring planting and hope to get back to square dancing soon.
