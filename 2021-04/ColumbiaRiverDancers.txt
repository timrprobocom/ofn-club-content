 So here is the deal.  We missed this year's anniversary dance.  It would have been our sixth.  No twice baked potatoes or Costco cake.  But did that deter our vice president, Melissa James?  No way.  She booked Adam Christman for our seventh annual dance on March 12th of 2022.  Mark it down now in your calendar.  There will be dancing soon.  Get your vaccine and stay healthy!
