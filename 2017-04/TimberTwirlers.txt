It has been a fun year of dancing so far. We had some trouble with the weather but spring is on the way.

We have had a Disney theme dance, a chili feed dance, a chocolate dance and Mardi Gras dance since the first of the year with lots more themes to come. We will be having the Girls Night out calling our first dance in April and a Star War theme dance in May,  plus lots more fun dances. So come join us the first and third Fridays of the month for great dancing. Sandy
