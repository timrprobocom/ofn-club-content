“The First of April, so called Prima Aprilis (from Latin prima, day; aprilis, humbug) is the only day of the year when elements, thoughts, words, and senses, all rushing towards springtime, observe a crazy, mad carnival and thanks to a traditional privilege abandon themselves to cosmic pranks, interplanetary riot, surprises of unleashed chaos, when at every step triumphant drivel flies in the face of the usual order of things!”  -- Antoni Słonimski and Julian Tuwim, in W oparach absurdu [In the Fumes of Absurd] (in Polish), 1958.

On the first Saturday of April, the Oaky Doaks will be enjoying the “traditional privilege” by doing like it says. Abandoning ourselves to pranks, surprises and triumphant drivel at our Fun Dance! Can you dance with a box on your feet, a sack over your head or a bean bag on your head? Can you take a joke or laugh with everyone else when you discover that you are at the center of a prank? Come join us on April 1st and be a part of the merriment and fun that we will be having.

The Anglo-Saxons called April ēastre-monaþ. The Venerable Bede says in “The Reckoning of Time” that this month ēastre is the root of the word Easter. He further states that the month was named after a goddess Eostre whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by Einhard in his work, “Vita Karoli Magni”.

On Saturday, April 15th, the Oaky Doaks will be having a Gospel Dance in recognition of the day. Gather with us as we get together with our fellow square and round dancers to commemorate and rejoice the following Sunday’s event with song, food and dance. It will be such enjoyable entertainment that maybe the other symbol of the holiday might stop by with some of his fowl gifts and sweets to celebrate with us as well. Everyone is bound to have a “Hoppy” good time.

See you on the dance floor,
Gary
