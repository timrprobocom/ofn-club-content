This month has been busy here at the Buckaroo Barn. We started the month with our Sweetheart Dance. We all had a great time being thankful for those close to us. Our next dance was our Sadie Hawkins Dance. During this dance we held a Relay for Life Fundraiser to benefit the American Cancer Society. We were able to raise $545.00!
Our mainstream lessons finished and we began workshops to help support our new dancers. They really appreciate the extra floor time, and the extra practice is evident on the dance floor.
A large group of Buckeroos headed down to Medford to help the Star Promenaders celebrate their 60th birthday! We enjoyed a night of great dancing with Randy Dibble calling and Mary Ann Callahan cuing.
We are looking forward to spring arriving in the coming months. It has been a long winter!

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
