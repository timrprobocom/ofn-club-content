I'm so glad the weather has decided to warm up for all of us.  Spring, we are ready for you.  The Toes have been busy out on visitations dancing with our friends at Tri-Squares and the Hoedowners.  It was great to see so many dancers out supporting each otherâ€™s clubs.
 Dancing with the Leprechauns in March keeps us on our toes.  Our Pot of God is full of square dancing friends that we keep year after year.  We all are so blessed in the square dance world.  Thanks to Sandra Pinion for stepping in for Bev and Harlan for the month of March.  We are wishing both Bev and Harlan healthy bodies, so we can have them back on the dance floor.
 April 7th is our regular dance with Julie Stout starting us out with pre-round dancing at 7:30 pm.  Thanks Julie for helping the Flints out.  This dance will be held at the Odd Fellows Hall in Hillsboro and April 21st is our famous Ducky Dance starting with pre-plus at 7:30 pm with KC and Linda.  Molly Combs will be stepping in for Bev and Harlan.  Thanks Molly.  Be sure to wear yellow and be ready to flap your wings out on the floor.  The Toes are looking forward to our Mystery trip on April 22nd.  These extra club activities are so much fun and help the club members get to know each other better, especially for our new dancers.
 We hope you come and visit us with this warmer weather ahead.  I cannot believe how fast this year has flown by.  We are looking at selecting a new slate of club officers for next year.  We are thankful for our members who step up and help to make our club so much fun.  The Toes are the best.  See you in a square.
