As I write this, the weather remains a conversational topic.  In spite of winter hanging on, good attendance has come along.  We have been enjoying the lively, friendly Valley River Dancers, as well as dancers from other clubs.  Switching to half an hour early for opening and closing seems to be a winner with the dancers, many of whom stay for the last dance now.
 In the OFN I noticed someone wanting a way to know if dances will be held in bad weather when it's a last minute decision.  She thought that Facebook posting might be the answer.  Since I don't do social media, I continue to encourage readers to check our website, which seems to work for everyone. 
  At midwinter our own president, Dan Knierim and wife Debbie, were in the second place square for Last Square Standing.  Way to go everyone!
