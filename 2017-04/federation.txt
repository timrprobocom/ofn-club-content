<h3>Annual Membership Information Update</h3>
<p>Every year, in the first half of the year,&nbsp;we ask all clubs and councils to update their membership information, to prepare for printing the state directory. &nbsp;We ask that you update the information after you have elected your officers for the new square dance year, so that the information is correct when the directories are distributed in September. &nbsp;At this time, the annual membership dues also become due. &nbsp;Attached is a letter being sent from the Membership Chairman, Sylvia Davis, to all of the Area Delegates telling them about this process.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dear Council Delegate,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the Area Delegate, you play a key role in making sure all the membership information for the clubs in your council get correctly updated and printed in the State Directory.&nbsp; You need to make sure that each club receives an instruction letter telling them how to fill out the Club Information Form online.&nbsp; Then, you need to make sure that you fill out the Council Information Form online.&nbsp; Then, you need to collect all the checks for dues and Where and When information from your clubs, have your treasurer deposit those checks in your council account and write a single check to the OFSRDC for State dues and Where &amp; When, and mail it to the Membership Chairman.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To fill out the Council Information Form, go to the Federation&rsquo;s web site at <a href="http://squaredance.gen.or.us/ClubInfo/">squaredance.gen.or.us/ClubInfo</a>.&nbsp; Please follow the instructions to complete the form.&nbsp; Please verify the accuracy of the information you enter. &nbsp;Double-check the spelling of last names and cities, where many spelling errors occur.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The information your club provides will be used to create the State Directory and update the Where &amp; When section of the Oregon Federation News (OFN).&nbsp; Remember that the Directory is printed and distributed in September and therefore, your information should reflect the officers that will be in effect at that time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">BE SURE THE TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBER AND THE NON-PROFIT VERIFICATION INFORMATION IS CORRECT on the online form.&nbsp; Also please remember that it is your responsibility to submit a council check to the Membership Chairman to cover the state membership dues and Where and When fees for your council and all the clubs in your council (do not include any council dues).&nbsp; You should include a summary sheet showing which clubs paid which amounts.&nbsp; Please try to have this check to the State Membership Chairman by the July 16, 2017 state meeting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">State dues are $20.00.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your help and assistance in this task is greatly appreciated.</p>
