The Charlie's have enjoyed getting back into the dancing spirit. Hopefully the weather will not affect our dancing anymore! 
Congratulations to our newest graduates!!! Our September class graduated on March 14th and will be starting to workshop and improve their skills. We had 6 that graduated. We hope to keep them excited about dancing and learning.
Our March dances were lots of fun; Ray called our 1st Saturday dance and Mary Nutt cued.  Ray was out of town for our 3rd Saturday dance, so we got to welcome Wayne Weaver back from a 3 month vacation. He called our "Awkward Moments" dance and Bob Dingman cued.  We had a great turnout with 3 plus squares; we even had 3 squares for the A1 tip - which was wonderful!!  The Stars stole a banner; so the Charlie's will be coming for theirs soon!
The Charlie's stole a banner from the Rogue Squares when we enjoyed dancing on St. Patrick's Day to Lawrence Johnstone from Ukiah, CA. Lawrence is a great caller, so if you've never danced to him you're definitely missing out - he is a lot of fun!
We are dark at our hall on April 1st, but we will still be dancing. We will be in Roseburg to enjoy dancing to Mike Sikorsky on April 1st, and The Crew on April 2nd. Don't miss out - and we will see you up there!
April 15th will be called by Ray and rounds with Steve Murphy; always a fun time!
We are getting excited for the Boatnik Festival!! Don't forget to get your ribbons; which you can do online; or with any committee member. The fabulous Hunter Keller & Randy Lewis will be our featured caller & cuer. Get your ribbons before the registration price goes up!
The Charlie's look forward to seeing our friends in a square soon!!
Happy Dancing!!
