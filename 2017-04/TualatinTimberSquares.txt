Please note our dance dates have changed due to inclement weather in the beginning of the year.  Our first dance in 2017 is going to be a trifecta of celebrations!  Trophy dance! Anniversary Dance! New Dancer dance!  We will be hosting this Grand Trophy Dance April 26th!  The club with the highest percentage of membership in attendance will win the trophy!  Students of other clubs will be counted towards that club’s percentage.  Please encourage your new dancers to come out and support our new dancers and see who wins the trophy!  Everyone who comes gets to go home with a dangle.
 If you would like to be added to the TTS weekly newsletter to keep up on all of the adventures and where the Banner Bandits are hitting next send an email to OregonSquareDance@gmail.com
