Thereâ€™s been much discussion about getting background checks for callers and cuers who are involved in youth activities, or where there is repeated contact with youth. This would be mostly at the state level dances, since most clubs have few if any children attending.

Standardizing caller and cuer contracts are also being discussed, with a lot of great input by Scott Zinser.
