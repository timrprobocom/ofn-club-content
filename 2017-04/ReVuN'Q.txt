As I write this article, our club is about to start Cha Cha lessons with some students who have not had intermediate lessons before. We are looking forward to having some new faces in our lesson hour from 7:30-8:20. We continue to have floor time in the first and third hour. We have been dancing some favorites and some dances that are not danced often. It is always good to have variety.

Some of our dancers attended the Beach Ball and had a good time. The weather was not the best but they made do.

We have some dates to fill while Cheryl attends various events for dance and family. Our Vice-President is charged with getting guest cuers for those dates. Stay tuned for announcements of when. Come join us and get some floor time for your dancing pleasure.  Marilyn Schmit
