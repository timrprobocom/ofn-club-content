The HAPPY HOPPERS will host our regular first and third Saturday dances at the Clark County Square Dance Center with Jim Hattrick calling and cueing.  Rounds start at 7:30 with Plus squares at 8:00.  The April 1 agenda will include an April Fools-style indoor pot-luck picnic starting at 5:00, followed by the election of club officers.  On April 15 will be our annual Ice Cream Social Dance.  Don't miss that one!

We work hard to make our education program a comfortable environment for students.  Many of our club members volunteer as "Angels" to help make it an easy and productive experience.  We are committed to serving both beginners and continuing students with our lesson format.  Every Monday, Plus lessons will be given at 6:30, Basic lessons start at 7:30, and Mainstream lessons are available at 9:00.
