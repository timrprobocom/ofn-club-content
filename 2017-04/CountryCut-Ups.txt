April will bring more spring weather and an exciting 5th Saturday dance At the Boring Barn. On April 29th at 7:00 PM, Scott Zinser will be calling our all Plus level Blacklight Dance. That should be a fun time. 

We are excited to have back to back Mainstream classes this year. We graduated 11 new dancers on February 23rd and had over ten new students show up for lessons on March 2nd. Stay tuned for how it is going! We can always use angels on Thursdays evenings 7:30 to 9:30 PM.
