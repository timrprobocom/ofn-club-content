Yo, Bachelors and Bachelorettes, come get your banner! You know, the one we captured on March 1, because we had, like, 9 or so members there. The gauntlet has been thrown!

Here’s a huge shout out for a quick recovery to our own Sharon Dibble. Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

Thank you to all of the dancers who helped us celebrate our 17th birthday. The floor was filled with our members and friends; the dance community across Oregon and Southern Washington give us all a sense of belonging. Those connections are priceless.

Lessons are off to a great start, and we are absolutely delighted that we have some young ‘uns participating. They are doing great despite the sashayed square of angels doing their best to disrupt the classroom.

Randy’s Kennewick plus challenge weekend kept him away from our plus dance, but we thank George Hermann for putting us through our paces. We had a grand time!

And, speaking of randy Randy, if you are at a workshop and you see him pull out index cards, run for your life. He’s choreographing competition dances and we are his guinea pigs. Seriously, it is a blast dancing with the Valley River Dancers…it’s always unpredictable, exciting, and the formations are often novel. We learn new things all of the time, which keeps us on our toes. Join us for the fun!
