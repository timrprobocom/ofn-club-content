March 4th we had a nice visitation with the Independence Wagon Wheelers. We were graciously welcomed and given our banner back  It is a long way to go, but at least it didn't rain constantly or snow or hail on us. Good conversation while on the road helps make the time pass quickly.  On April 1st, we hope to see more people out for our visitation to dance to Mike Sikorsky in the Buckeroo Barn at Roseburg. We need to get back our banner from them too!  

On April 28th we will be having our Psychedelic 60s dance with Scott Zinser and Christina Corelli. That should be a hoot if everyone dresses the part.
