We had a great dance February 20.  We had 17 visitors from Silver City Squares which made for a really fun night.  We had over 4 squares!  We donated $250 to the Silver City Squares youth for their competition in Canada.  We haven’t been in the “News” for a while if you don’t know who we are we dance in Woodburn on the odd Monday nights at The Estates auditorium.  We have a great dance floor.  Randy Dibble is our caller and Jackie Gale is our cuer.  We start with rounds at 7pm followed by squares at 8pm with every 3rd tip Plus.  When there is a 5th Monday we have “Pie Night” which we usually have a good turnout.  Lots of home-made pie.  Our next Pie Night is Memorial Day.  We would love to see you!

Hope to see you in a square.
