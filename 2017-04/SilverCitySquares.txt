Thank you to everyone who joined us for our Birthday Dance in February. We enjoyed dancing to Leonard and Frances. 
Our youth are practicing hard for competition. We are still selling Teen Festival pins. Please catch one of us at a dance to get yours. We will be heading up to Langley British Columbia on May 5. See you at a dance!  Petrina Buchheit
