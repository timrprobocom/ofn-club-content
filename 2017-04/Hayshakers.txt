We have 13 people taking lessons.  It is very exciting.  We think that most of them will join the club which will be thrilling if they do.  One gentleman has already asked if he could join.  As far as our dances, it has been hit and miss due to the weather.
 Hayshakers are now dancing the 1st Fridays from 6:30 pm.  Harvey Hunsucker caller & cuer.  Dance is at the Pacific Grange, 90475 Hwy 101, Cullaby Lake, at Warrenton, OR.
