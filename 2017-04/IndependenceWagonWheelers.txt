Our first dance in March was a wonderful event.  We were pleased to have a visitation from several Single Trees and Danebo Circle 8â€™s.  And if that was not enough, we were surprised by a raid from the Whirl-a-Ways.  For those of you who have not participated in a raid before, it is an enjoyable way of visiting a club.  Since the club being raided does not know that you are coming, it is important that the club doing the raiding bring snacks with them.  This way the club being raided does not feel the need to go out to the closest store and purchase food.
At our second dance in March we celebrated our 57th birthday. This is always a fun dance.  Our board members take care of the door, kitchen and decorations and the club provides cake and ice cream. This way the club members get to just come and enjoy the dance without any of the responsibilities that go along with putting on a dance. 
Happy Dancing. Linda Neuschwander
