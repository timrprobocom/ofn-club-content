Free square dance classes continue on the dance floor at the Tillamook Elks lodge, 1907 Third Street in downtown Tillamook.  The classes are taught by club caller Joe Wrabek.  Waltz classes, taught by veteran cuer Connie Clark, started in mid-February at the Rockaway Beach Community Center.
 The Wave Steppers’ second dance of 2017, our Spring Dance, will be Saturday, April 8th on the big dance floor at Garibaldi City Hall, 107 6th Street (at Acacia), with Jim Hattrick calling and cueing.  About two-thirds of the building’s second floor is a dance floor, built in the 1940s by the Fire Department for the old Firemen’s Balls.
