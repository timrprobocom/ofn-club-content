What?  Another Anniversary Dance?  You just had one.  You know how time flies when you are having fun.  Join us Sunday, April 23rd at the Hillsboro IOOF Hall. Pre Plus 1:00 to 1:30 pm, Mainstream 1:30 to 3:30 pm with chicken dinner at 3:30 pm.  All this for $6 and you can dance both MS and Plus with our three great callers.  What a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon and get your TVC Ambassador form signed from a plus club.
 Our King and Queen of Hearts Dance celebrated not only Valentineâ€™s Day but also the first of our Plus Lessons.  This year Marie Clem and Bob Allen were chosen by lottery as Queen and King of Hearts.  They wore their crowns with dignity, even if they did tend to slip a little, and behaved as royalty must toward the hoi polloi.  It was fun.
 Nearly three squares of our members attended the Hoedowners Anniversary Dance which included a chicken dinner.  As usual the Hoedowners throw an excellent party and a good time was had by all. 
 Our Plus lessons continue with our three excellent callers from noon to 1:15 pm.  Students have the option to stay for a couple of tips with the club and practice what they have learned.  Our $4 donation is a bargain. 
 We dance on most holidays so even those of you who are not retired can join us once in a while.  Our three callers, Jim Hattrick, Daryl Clendenin, and Darrell Kalmbach keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:15 to 3:00 pm, at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.  Come out and brush up, the $4 covers the whole 3 hours.
