As I write this we just finished with our Hobo Dance on March 3.  It was great fun.  Thanks to Danny Rickard for the awesome decorations and idea for this dance, to Lanie Rickard for making the three delicious Hobo stews that everyone enjoyed and to all of the dancers who joined us and made it a great night. Check out our Facebook page for photos. 

March also has our St. Patrick's Day Dance on the 17 where everyone is wearing the green and dancing the night away.  And we have a 5th Friday Plus Dance on the 31st.

We have 13 new students learning to square dance at our Wednesday lessons, one of which is only 8 years old and she loves to twirl.

On April 21 we will celebrate our 51st year as a club. Come join the fun. We will also be electing new club officers in April. Next monthâ€™s report will have those names.

We dance on the first and third Fridays of the month. If there is a 5th Friday, we have a Plus dance.  We dance year round so please come on over to the Salem Square Dance Center and dance with us. See you on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
