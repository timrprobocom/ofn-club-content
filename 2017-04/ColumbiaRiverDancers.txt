Our Pajama dance was not a sleeper.  Caller Jim Hattrick was decked out in his long nightgown and his night cap.  Lots of laughs were had at the expense of those who took to the theme.
  This month we celebrate our second anniversary with Adam Christman calling and cueing.  It being close to St. Paddy's day we will have the wearing of the green and Irish treats.
  Lessons are going strong.  We have a beginner's class starting the first Tuesday of each month so if you have someone who wants to learn, send them down.  With our "angels" we had over three squares of dancers last Tuesday.
  Come dance with us.  Our goal is to have everyone dance so even if you are a single, we welcome you.
