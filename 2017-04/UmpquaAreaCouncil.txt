April fools is just around the corner, but itâ€™s no JOKE that we are having the State Federation dance May 6th and would like to remind folks that we would love to have a barn full of visitors for the Federation Dance that evening.  Come join us at the Barn and meet and dance with the Executive Board and State delegates. 
See our flyer for more info or give us a call.
