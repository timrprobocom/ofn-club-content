Spring! Woo hoo! In April we are celebrating spring and our 59th anniversary as a square dance club. Our anniversary dance is on Saturday, April 15th at the Hazel Dell Grange. It will be all singing calls. We will have Roger Puzler as our guest caller. Our cuer for the night will be Patty Herman. Door prizes will be abundant and "Bee" related.

Our cuer for the April Fool's dance is Debbie Combs . Obviously, that would be on April 1st at the Hazel Dell Grange.

We are proud to announce that we have graduated 7 new Square dancers from our lessons group and welcome them into our club. It was a great graduation dance. We are proud of them.

Have a great spring!
