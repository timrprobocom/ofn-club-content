To earn your TVC Ambassador badge you need to visit each of the TVC clubs and attend two TVC sponsored events within an 18 month period.  For those of you who dance Mainstream and are trying to earn your badge, the Eager Beavers who normally dance Plus are having their Anniversary dance on April 23rd as a Mainstream dance.  It will be held at the Hillsboro IOOF Hall from 1:00 pm to 3:30 pm.
 The TVC’s "Sunday Afternoon Delight", dance on March 5th was a big success with over ten squares attending.  The dance featured popular International caller Gary Shoemake with Yvonne Clendenin cueing.
 Our next Council dance will be a 5th Saturday “Spring Fling Dance” at the Aloha Grange on April 29th, 2017.  Mike and Julie Stout will be the caller and cuer with a mainstream format and pre-rounds.
