Spring marks new beginnings, and so it is with River City Dancers.
 
On February 12th, we sent our caller couple, Les and Paula Seeley, off with a grateful, wondful flourish marked by “The Crew and Rudd”:  Daryl Clendenin; Randy Dibble; Jim Hattrick; and Renee’ Rudd (with the latter’s permission, sometimes known as “The Crewdd” (excuse the spelling).  Tami Helms and Tim Keck donated their Cueing.  It was a wonderful/sad/glad event to a packed house at Milwaukie Community Center.
 
We will be having Guest Callers until November, with feedback forms available to the membership.  According to our plan, the Caller Selection Committee will pick the top three candidates, and we will vote our selection at the November General Meeting.
 
Another historic first:  at a recent membership meeting, River City Dancers, formely a “Couples Club’ is now accepting singles as new members.  If you are interested in formally joining us, talk to any officer or member, and we will start the process.
 
Forty-two members enjoyed Winter Festival in Albany this year.  Thank you to all the workers who put it on.  It’s a great effort and we are proud to participate.  We look forward to Summer Festival in Salem this year at the Salem Blanchet Catholic School.
