February was a really busy month for our club.  Our first dance on February 4 was a fifties dance with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing. Poodle skirts were very popular. This dance was also our New Dancers dance so we had an experienced clothing sale. On February 11 we helped Sweet Home Squarenaders celebrate its birthday.   Great dance!  Jim Voll called and Jackie Gale cued.  We had a regular dance on February 19.  Then we traveled to Corvallis for their birthday dance.     Each Sunday evening the Lebanon Square Circlers are having Plus lessons also.  
 
March 4 is our Hippie dance.  Many of our club members are going to the Coast March 10-12 to participate in the Corvallis Squares Coast Weekend. That will be a fun weekend.  

 Our Mystery Trip is planned for April 29 and we are looking forward to traveling with members of other clubs. Then, of course, we are getting ready for the Strawberry Festival the first weekend of June. Hope you are planning to come. See you in a square!  Marilyn York
