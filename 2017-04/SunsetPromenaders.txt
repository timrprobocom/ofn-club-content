Our April dances are:
• The first Saturday of April the Club is DARK, April 1st, because we are dancing at the Valley Squares Anniversary Dance.  
• The third Saturday, April 15th, is our Easter Parade Dance.  This will be a good time to dress up and show off your best clothes or just come to the dance, enjoy dancing, and your friends.  Our dance times are now 7:00 to 7:30 Intermediate Rounds, 7:30 to 9:30 Mainstream dance, with Mike Stout calling and Ken Pratt cueing.
• Our Promenaders Plus dances are on April 6th and 20th, come and enjoy Darrell Kalmbach’s Plus calling and Ken Pratt’s cueing.
 If parking on the street is full, you can park in the lot at the Premier Community Bank just across the street.
 We appreciate the Buzzin’ Bees Club visitation, we had six squares of dancers, and they were a lot of fun.  Their hall is in Vancouver so they had a long trip to get to Hillsboro, but they said they enjoyed themselves. Their caller and wife, KC and Linda Curtis came too.  Thanks. 
 Our lessons are coming along well and we have a great group of 11 students which makes it fun for the “Angels” too.  We really hope to get several members from this group as the club has been losing more dancers than gaining in the last several years.
