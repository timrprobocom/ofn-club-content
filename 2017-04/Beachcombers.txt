Beachcombers are having beginner lessons now with a good turnout on Sunday afternoon for jive, followed by square dance class.  Beginning two-step is being offered on Tuesday evenings.  We enjoyed having Tim Kane call our February dance, and are looking forward to having Richard Lane call our March dance on the 25th.  He called some dances for us many years ago, and he was one of our first callers for our Battle Rock Festival. Our own Cathy Houston will be cueing the rounds.  Everyone come join us for a great dance!
