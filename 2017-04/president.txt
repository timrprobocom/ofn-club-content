<p>April is approaching and we all hope that spring has arrived and that gardens are planted and lawns are starting to be mowed. But then again, with the recent history of our weather conditions, who knows what we are all doing when not dancing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many of you are making your summer travel plans for various festivals, dance weekends, or just plain fun? Have you included Summer Festival in Salem among your travels? It would be really nice to see many of you there enjoying the talent of the featured callers and cuers who will be there. It will be a fun weekend with plenty of activities planned. Dancing at the Capitol, getting snacks at the festival from the teens who will be manning the snack shack to help raise money for their travels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; March 25th will be a difficult day for many people. Two wonderful women will be laid to rest at separate memorial services. Marge Pentecost will be memorialized in The Dalles and Genevieve Churchill will be remembered at her memorial at the Sunset Presbyterian Church where the Eager Beavers dance. It should be a huge event. Come and share your thoughts about each one at whatever service you attend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Federation Youth Coordinator wrote an excellent article in the March issue of the OFN. If you did not read it, go back and find it and let her information sink in when you think of the parents who support their children in square dance activities. Lots to think about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be attending an award recognition dance in Eastern Oregon on April 8. Three people will be recognized for their efforts in supporting square dance and all associated activities. Merri Anne Huber and Bill and Neva Reid will be recognized by the Washington Federation, but these dancers are also Oregon Federation members that we can be proud of also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also be traveling to other parts of the state when time allows during the remaining time of my presidency. I will make it to all 10 councils by the time I go out of office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remind your clubs to take time to vote for Federation officers and get the ballots back in time by May 1.</p>
<p>Marilyn Schmit<br />President</p>
