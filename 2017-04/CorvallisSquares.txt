Our birthday dance on February 25 was well-attended and festive. Thanks to all who came to help us celebrate!

 On February 27, we graduated our newest class of mainstream dancers, who are a fun and enthusiastic group. Many thanks go to Bruce Lowther and Judy Russell who did a great job shepherding the new dancers along to become solid square dancers. 

By the time this OFN comes out, we will have had our Coast Retreat the weekend of March 10-12. Highlights include the dancing, of course, and the social time including the group potluck on Saturday at noon. It's not too early to save the 2nd weekend in March for next year's Coast Retreat! Karen
