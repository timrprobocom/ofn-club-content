After being dark due to inclement weather and the Mid-Winter Festival, 
Willamette Squares is off to a new start! Their new dancer dance took place 
on February 25 with a nice-sized crowd. Round dance lessons have begun and 
will be happening on Sunday evenings from 5:00 to 7:00 PM at the Salem 
Square Dance Center.

As always, we enjoy our time together either dancing and/or socializing. After a long, hard winter, with the season of spring around the corner, we are anticipating upcoming dances with a spring in our step! We invite everyone to join us. Jodee Howard
