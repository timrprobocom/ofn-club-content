We thank the Valley River Dancers for their March 1 visitation. We frequently get visitors from there, but an official visitation was quite a surprise!

Like many clubs, this is our club anniversary month. And it’s a great time to join our club.  Particularly If you’re unhappy with your own club, why not give our club a whirl?  Consider our dues:  for $12 a year, one will get at least three free dances.  Why, one can even MAKE money with such a deal!
