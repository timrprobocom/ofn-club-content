R Square D Dance Club welcomed all sweethearts to a Valentines dance on February 10th.  Visiting clubs of Cougar Squares and Ruff and Ruffles came to dance to the love songs being called by Craig Abercrombie and Lonnie Sycks.  Columbia River dancers retrieved a banner that R Square D had taken a while back.  The floor stayed busy with 4 squares sashaying around the room. 
 The 25th of February brought out all our new dancers with a B-51 dance.  Whoo-Hoo, 10 new dancers came out along with lots of visitors to welcome them.  A big Thank You goes out to Ruff & Ruffles and Harbor Haylofters.  Prairie Steppers and Cougar Squares both retrieved banners to take home.  Thank you to Dick and Sandy Sims for hosting the dance. 
 Many thanks go out to Mary McDaniel and Marv Pope for hosting the club meeting this month. 
 R Square D celebrates 64 years of Square dancing as a club on April 14th.  Please come out and have some cake with us as we continue to honor this dance we all love. 
 NOTE:  April 22nd, R Square D will be dark.  We will be travelling east to visit the Yakima Sashay with the Salty Sashayers.
