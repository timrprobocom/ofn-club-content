We have elections of officers for our club coming up.  What a fantastic group of people to choose from.  

We have Dan Norbye coming for us April which will be also our Easter dance. The dance promises to be a great dance with Ham and everything that goes with it.  Yum Yum.  

We are still looking for a new caller.  We plan on voting for a new caller in a few months.
