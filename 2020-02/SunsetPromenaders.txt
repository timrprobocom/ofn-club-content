 This month our Thursday Plus Dance nights which are on February 6th and 20th feature Darrell Kalmbach calling, with a guest cuer on the 6th and Julie Stiers cueing on the 20th.
 Our lessons continue but are closed to students with no experience on Sundays with our Mainstream lessons at 4:00 to 6:00.  Lessons are all at the Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall 267 E. Main Street.  Mike and Julie Stout will instruct the mainstream.  If you or someone you know are interested in brushing up your dance feel free to come and join in on one or more sessions. Angels are free, students are $6.
 Thank you to all you visitors that come to our dances, we really appreciate it, and your attendance is always a good thing. Thanks.
