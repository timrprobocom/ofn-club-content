 The Valley River Dancers dance Plus on 2nd Fridays (Randy Dibble Calling, Guest Cuer), and Mainstream on 4th Fridays (Randy Dibble Calling, Sherri Clark Cueing) in Newberg at the Chehalem Community Center.  Randy Dibble also calls our ‘A’ dances on 5th Saturdays at the Woodburn Senior Estates Community Club. https://www.valleyriverdancers.org
 We were saddened by the surprising news of Ken Pratt’s passing just after the New Year.  Not only was he an outstanding cuer and passionate teacher of round dancing, he was a good friend to many of us.  He will be missed by Valley River Dancers and the entire Square and Round Dance community for a long time to come.
 The Valley River Dancers New Dancer Jamboree / Christmas Dance on Friday, December 27th was a lot of fun, but not very well attended by new dancers as in previous years.  
 Our Anniversary Dance is Friday, February 28th.  We hope you will come dance and wish us a happy birthday in person and enjoy some delicious cake and ice cream as we celebrate at break.
 Beginning Tuesday, February 4th from 6:30-8 p.m. the Valley River Dancers and Chehalem Parks and Recreation Department sponsor mainstream lessons taught by Randy Dibble.  This 12 lesson class costs $68 per person and is payable in class, which will be held at the Chehalem Community Center (kitchen area) 2nd and Howard Streets.  
 February 9th is a 5th Saturday and we are dancing ‘A’ at the Woodburn Senior Estates Community Center.. come join the fun.
