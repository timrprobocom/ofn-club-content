Kurt Jensen, one of our members, suffered a minor stroke late November.  The best news is that Kurt is back to dancing!
 
Kurt and Lorna are angels for our Challenge C- 1 class.  There are many calls at C-1, but it's taking a long time as the class is Sundays and not everyone can be there, especially during the holidays.  It's fun nonetheless.  And yes, a challenge!
 
We dance almost every Sunday at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.  5:30 - 8:00.  We dance all levels.  Our caller, Tim Matteson, will adjust the levels according to who shows up to dance.  It's always FUN, and we always have a lot of FOOD!  We encourage all square dancers to join us!  The floor is cushioned and comfortable! We even have heat and air conditioning!
 
Please call Tim at 541-988-0399 or David at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are dancing.  We are dark once in a blue moon, but we'd hate to miss you.
 
Keep on dancing,
Christina Corelli
