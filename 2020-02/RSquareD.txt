 Last year, in December that is, for our "toy dance" we collected lots of toys to give to kiddos at the Salvation Army.  Thank you for your generosity.  Our dance was fantastic!  With all that goes on during December it is great to know that so many consider square dancing an event to attend.  Our Christmas party was pot luck with the club providing the meat.  So many great cooks among our dancers, yum.  After supper we had our gift exchange.  Lonnie, our MC/Santa makes this part so much fun!  He thinks of the silliest things to comment on, everyone laughs and has a great time as we consider stealing or the surprise of opening a new gift.  Thank you for the dancers from other clubs who joined us in the gaiety.  It was a wonderful way to end the year.
 February is Valentine month and our first dance is ON THE day, so bring your Valentine out for a dance.  The dance on Saturday February 22nd will be rockin' and rollin' 50s and 60s with Guest caller Mark Wheeler.  This dance is always fun as this vintage is very familiar to most of us.  If there is a poodle skirt in your closet, now might be the time to justify keeping it.  And the guys can roll up their sleeves and slick back their hair.  Brylcream cream IS still available.
