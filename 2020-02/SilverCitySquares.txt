Thank you to everyone who came and enjoyed our New Dancer dance and our baked potato dinner. A great time was had dancing to Leonard, Frances and our guest callers and cuers.

Our competition teams are now into regular practice schedule, which means twice a week. We had some team building exercises during January to help us work together better. We are planning on two square teams, four  callers, two cuers and one round couple this year. We are still selling the festival pins and have added our raffle tickets to our sale items.

Please mark your calendars for Sunday, March 2, 2020 for our fundraiser dance. We will be having the drawing for our cash raffle; raffle baskets/silent auction and great fun.

See you at a dance soon
