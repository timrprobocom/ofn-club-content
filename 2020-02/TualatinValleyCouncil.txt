 Since the OFN is published around the 20th of January, you still have time to plan on the TVC's annual Presidents  Potluck at the Hillsboro IOOF Hall on the 27th.  The evening will begin with the potluck dinner starting at 6:00 followed by a meeting at 7:00.  All TVC club Presidents & dancers are invited to join us.  The TVC wishes to thank all the presidents of the TVC Clubs for volunteering their time and efforts into this activity we all love.  Also, at this meeting the TVC President, Mike St Clair, will announce the recipient of the Tualatin Valley Council “Recognition Award” for outstanding service and special contribution to the square dance community within the TVC geographical area.  
 The New Years Eve dance had unusually low attendance probably due to the illness affecting many of our dancers.  Those who were in attendance had a good time with an abundance of food and treats.  Darrell Kalmbach and Sherri Clark kept us all dancing with their calling and cueing.  As the New Year approached we all gathered in a big circle and ushered in the New Year.  The Sunset Promenaders won the TVC banner for having the highest percentage of the club in attendance.
 The next TVC fifth Saturday Dance, "Celebrate Winter Ending", will be held at the Aloha Grange on February 29th.  This dance will feature Adam Christman calling and Joyce Hooper cueing.  The dance begins at 7:30 with pre rounds, then  8:00 to 10:00 mainstream with every third tip plus.  This dance is co-hosted by the M 'n M's.  Please bring finger foods & deserts for all to enjoy.
