 February 7th is a regular dance, and February 21st will be our Cherry Blossom dance.  We’d love to see you across a square, so come on over to the Kinton Grange and have some fun with the Toe’s.
 By this time round dance lessons should be well under way, we always need extra angels, so join us on Sunday afternoons from 2:00-4:00.
