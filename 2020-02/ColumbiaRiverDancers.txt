 As you may have heard, our caller, Jim Hattrick has had a spell of bad health.  He will be out for a while recovering and all of our prayers are for his speedy and complete recovery.  He missed our New Year’s Eve dance and the “Back Porch Trio” became a duo.
 December was a great month, otherwise.  We had Mike and Julie Stout with us and as usual they did a wonderful job.  On the 28th, Darrell Kalmbach and Susan Healea graciously filled in for Jim.  So a big SHOUT-OUT to both of them. 
 Now on to the short month of February.  Our ONLY dance this month will be on the 8th.  Craig Abercrombie and Julie Stiers do us the honors that evening. The 4th Saturday on February is always reserved by the Grange for the Cloggers conference and dance.  Thus, sadly we will be dark.  But, that gives us the opportunity to visit our friends so that seems be in the works.
 We have decided to continue with our beginning lessons and our mainstream lessons while Jim is away.  Our next beginning square dance lessons will begin the first Tuesday in February.  Otherwise, lessons are continuing as usual.
