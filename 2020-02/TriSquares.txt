 In December we had a great time at our annual Christmas party dinner at the Royal Panda in Tigard (Bridgeport) in their very adequate side room.  The food and service were really good and we had a lot of fun with the usual white elephant gift exchange.  Social events like this allow people time together to get to know each other.
 In February we’ll have our big dance, the Mardi Gras Masquerade Ball, right on Valentine’s Day and hope you all can come.  Terry Halley will be calling and Sandra Pinion cueing, and there will be prizes for best masks and costumes, but come in regular dance attire if you like instead.  Rounds and Plus begin at 7:30, with Mainstream at 8:00 and we break downstairs at 10:00.
 Also in February WE WILL BE DARK ON FEBRUARY 28th, instead we will be visiting Valley River Dancers in Newberg.  Because of the change in our dance nights this year (to second & fourth Fridays) conflicting with their dance nights, and since they are new members of TVC, we wanted to support them one last time.
