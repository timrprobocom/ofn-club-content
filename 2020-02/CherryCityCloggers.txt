Cherry City Cloggers are very excited about the fact that our club is growing. Just before Christmas we graduated 14 beginner cloggers and several of them have decided to join the club at the start of the New Year. It is so exciting to see our dance floor on Tuesday nights getting crowded once again.

We now have our new officers taking over in the new year: Rolita LaForge, Vice President; Pam Secrest, Secretary; Miranda Mann, Treasurer; Cathy Drawson, Area Representative; and Mary Ellen Ramseyer continuing as our President. 

Just to pass the word along in case anyone is looking for some, we have two Yamaha C115V Club Concert Series Passive 2-Way Speakers for sale. They were purchased in 2009 and only used on four occasions. They still work very well; we just no longer want to store them. We paid approximately $900 for the pair in 2009. They have recently been inspected by Joel from Apex Audio and Lighting (where they were purchased) and he said a reasonable price for both would be $500 but we are asking only $300 for the pair. If anyone is interested, contact Mary Ellen Ramseyer, our president, with questions or to purchase at 503-689-3733 (can also text this number) or email her at ramseyer_mary@hotmail.com.
