Happy New Year Belatedly!  Cast A Shadows continues to dance some Sundays in Hall B, access is on the rear of the Emerald Square Dance Center in Springfield.  Be sure to check the website for our schedule of forthcoming dances but to be on the safe side it is good to call to make sure we are dancing as we cancel when not enough dancers respond to say they are coming (541-741-4149 or 458-221-3564).  We are dancing from 2-4:00PM these days because the new challenge (C-1) class is held at 1PM..
 
We had a very nice turnout of two squares at our final dance of the year Sunday Dec. 22 when we danced to recorded tips.  Our thanks to Fred and Kathleen Beise who coordinates our advanced program as well as the challenge classes being held currently at the Emerald Square Dance Center on the Sundays before our advanced dances and in Junction City on those Sundays when we don’t have an advanced dance scheduled.  Fred always finds the best tips done by top-notch callers: Bronc Wise and Darryl Lipscomb being among our favorites.
 
If you wish to be placed on a notification email list, call Fred at 458-221-3564.
 
My apologies to all who may have tried to access our website using the URL I put in last month’s OFN.  The correct URL is cas-sd.yolasite.com.
 
We are all looking forward to dancing to Dan Preedy (WA) on Sunday, Feb. 9, 2020 from 2-4PM.  Please mark your calendar for this fun event.
 
Keep on learning and dancing.
