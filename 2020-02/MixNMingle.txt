 You’ll find us dancing at the Winona Grange on February 1st and 15th and though it’ll be too late to celebrate Valentine’s Day on that third Saturday dance, we’ll be sure to sing Happy Birthday to Dan Knierim, one of our 4 charter members, who is still a very big part of the club.  
 Speaking of birthdays, the Winona Grange will be celebrating its 125th Anniversary this year; they are planning some special events in the fall.  In a recently distributed newsletter, we learned that the Winona Grange members first met at Thompson’s Hall and from there moved to the old Tualatin High School.  When the school closed in about 1939, the members built the current building.  Its timber was cut from the Pennington farm and the posts downstairs came from the Buchanan place.  The grange was named Winona after JRC Thompson’s daughter who had passed away.  The article writes of the Oregon State College student who was hired to teach the teenagers how to square and round dance and also of the hall filled with local kids having a great time on Saturday nights.  I guess M&M’s are just doing what we can to keep that tradition alive!
