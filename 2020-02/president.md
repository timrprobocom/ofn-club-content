As we move into February, we are now past Mid-Winter Festival. I hope everyone had a lot of fun! I sure did.

We have a lot to look forward to this month and this year. February has Super Bowl for those who actually watch and follow football (sorry – I really don’t pay any attention to football at any level); Valentine’s Day, which falls on a Friday this year – so take your sweetheart out to a square dance; and this is a Leap Year!

There are a lot of festivals and special dances throughout the year. Keep a watch for flyers and information on bulletin boards, at dances and especially on our Oregon Federation website. Make sure you are passing information along to our newer dancers and encourage them to explore the Federation website and OFN.

Hope to see you at a dance soon.
