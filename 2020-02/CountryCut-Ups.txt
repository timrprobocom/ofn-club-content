Come dance with the Country Cut-Ups for possibly a once in a lifetime experience! We will be having our 5th Saturday dance on Leap Year Day, February 29th, 2020! Gals, plan to bring your favorite date or get up the courage to ask that guy you want to dance with, Sadie Hawkins style! We start at 7 PM and it will be all Plus dancing with George and Patti Hermann. Come out and have a fun time!

We will be graduating mainstream students this month and it has been fun to have quite a few younger people. We welcome all who want to joint our club.

Last month, I asked you to save the date for the next Murder Mystery Play and
Dance, but then we changed the date! The new date to mark on your calendar is April 19th. We look forward to your support!
