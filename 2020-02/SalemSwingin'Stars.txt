Our New Dancer dance on December 20 was a great dance with eight squares of dancers. We also had a blast at our New Year's Eve dance ringing in the year 2020 with lots of friends and laughter. 

There are three dances in January including a 5th Friday Plus Dance and of course we are looking forward to dancing and seeing everyone at Mid-Winter Festival. Come join us for our Annual Wear Red Dance the first Friday in February to call attention to heart disease. Then look for the flyer for our Annual Hobo Dance the third Friday in March.

Amidst all the celebration we are greatly saddened by the passing of Ken Pratt. He has been a great substitute Cuer for our club for many years. We will miss him immensely and our thoughts and prayers are with Dianne and their family. See you on the dance floor.
