As we deal with our emotions at the loss of Ken Pratt, we are working on improving more of our rhythms and moves. Now that Mid-Winter is almost over, we can put our thoughts together and figure out what we want to learn next.  So many options.

We send our healing thoughts to Dianne Pratt as she deals with the after effects of Kenâ€™s passing and all that death entails. She has a large round dance family to be around her and keep her company.

We still dance on Thursdays at 6:30 p.m. at the Salem Square Dance Center. Come and join us.
