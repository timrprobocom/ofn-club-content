ATTENTION:  SINGLE MEN:
Happy New Year to all square dance Clubs and dancers.   We especially need men at this time.  Please come and see what we are all about.  We have great callers and cuers, dance floors, lots of parking and lunch after the dance.  We are an older group and dance a little slower

If you have not danced for along time, not to worry, just come.  And of course we mean ladies too.

Let's all work to build up square dancing this year.  We meet almost all Fridays.
                                                                            
Sincerely, NC
