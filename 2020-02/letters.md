title: Thank you from the Smith family
---
We would like to thank everyone in our square dance family for making a **HUGE** difference after the tragedy of losing almost everything we owned in our house fire.  On December 24th we came home from church to find our house on fire.  Long story short, we lost almost everything including our 4 pets: Pepé my 14-year-old long-hair chihuahua, Jasepi our rescue cat from Louisiana (he survived Hurricane Katrina), Nola— Lily’s cat, and Smokey— Blake’s Chinchilla.  We are finding a few little things as we sift through the remains left after the fire.

We are still living in Grants Pass. We are recovering slowly thanks to our church coming to the rescue that evening and bringing each of us a change of clothing and some basic essentials, athletic coaches and team providing Gabriel and Lily with clothes to continue in sports, my RCC co-workers are helping me with needed items for work, and our **square dance family** for giving, and giving, and giving.  So many have been generous to provide for us to start over again. Lily and I are blessed with square dance skirts, blouses, petticoats, and pettipants, Gabriel and Blake now have dance towels, shirts, ties, and club vest, We all have badges to wear at MidWinter.  And, we have been given bedding, quilts, clothes, and household items for our new home.

Gift cards have allowed me to replace items in the kitchen to cook, laundry items, and all those little things you don’t think about until you go to get it and realize you don’t have it anymore. Not to mention all the help to get clothes, toiletries, and shoes for all 5 grandchildren and myself.  Thank you does not seem like enough to my square dance family for your generosity from California, Carson City, Northern Oregon, and close to home.  The response to help this family has made a significant difference for each of us, the outpouring of love and kindness fills our hearts. I Pray I can repay everything forward when we get back on our feet.  This family is blessed to have so many caring people we call family.

The fire is still under investigation, we know the fire was NOT caused by anything we did.  It’s now a battle for Fire investigators to prove, that should be complete around January 29th, I hope.  We cannot proceed with tearing down the old and rebuilding the new until the investigation is complete.  But, we will rebuild, we will be continuing to square dance, we are back to school and work.  Thanks to everyone’s generosity we were able to return to work and school without missing a day.  We will see you at MidWinter wearing square dance attire.   We arrive late Thursday night.

Love, Hugs, and Prayers to you,   
Lorri, Blake, Gabriel, Lily, Junior, and Sammy
