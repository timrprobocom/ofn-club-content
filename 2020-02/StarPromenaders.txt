I can't remind you all enough! Don't forget July at Diamond Lake 2020. We will have a real "TRIFECTA" and a Bonus with three callers of National Status. We will have Mike Sikorsky, Michael Kellogg and Mike Haworth, with the bonus of Rikki Lobato as the featured cuer.
Come out & join us on March 13th for the next Game Night. The theme for this one has yet to be decided. We have a blast. If you don't play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on. We are open to most table games.

Classes are going well & the students are really enthusiastic. There is also a new beginning dancer class that started on January 13th. Everyone is having a great time with classes. The Thursday class is getting close to graduation and doing very well.

The Febuary Dance has been designated an "Amateur Night." If you are an aspiring caller or cuer, come out! Phil Ramey will be emceeing. COME ON DOWN!!!!

The Stars are once again collecting stuffed animals for the Jackson County Sheriff's Department to give to children in distress. Last year we collected and donated 200+ animals. I think we can do better. There is a tote on the stage at the Rogue Valley Square Dance Center to put the animals in. PLEASE HELP!!

We are again going to sponsor the Alzheimers Benefit Dance. It will be on Sunday, June 7, 2020 from 2 to 5pm. This is a very worthy cause and hits home to a lot of us in the square dance world.  All proceeds will go to Alzheimer Research. The Callers & Cuers are donating their time and the Stars are donating the hall. A challenge has been issued. Last year we raised $520+ and the challenge is to double that; at the very least.

See you in a square!
