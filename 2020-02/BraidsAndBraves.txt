What a wonderful turnout for our New Dancer Dance on December 21! We had 70 people with visitors from Albany Timber Twirlers. Independence Wagon Wheelers, Salem Swinging Stars, Silver City Squares, Valley River Dancers, Tri-Squares and Chaps & Petticoats as well as some independent dancers. Visiting callers sharing the stage with Leonard Snodgrass were Bruce Lowther from the Timber Twirlers, George Herman from the Wagon Wheelers, Terry Halley from Tri-Squares and Thomas Buchheit from Silver City.  Our Sandra Pinion shared the cueing with Judy Russell from the Timber Twirlers. The floor was packed and everyone was having a great time. We hope that visiting other clubs for these dances will encourage these New Dancers (and all dancers) to continue visiting other clubs. This is how we promote our great activity and keep it alive.
