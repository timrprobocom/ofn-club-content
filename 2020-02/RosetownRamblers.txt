The Ramblers have already had an epic January, and the month isn’t even half over.
 
We hosted our first ever Plus Blast on January 11, in which we attempted to teach all of the Plus calls over the course of one day (9 am to 5 pm). We had 11 enthusiastic students, and Ian Craig did a spectacular job of teaching and time management. He taught all of the Plus calls with time to spare for a couple of practice tips with singing calls. We were fortunate to have lots of angelic support from our own club and other PAC clubs. Accordingly, we were able to rotate in fresh groups of angels throughout the day. This was a really positive experience for all.
 
The party didn’t end at 5, though, because January 11 was our regular monthly dance night. So, we ran home and changed our duds and came back recharged for our annual Black and White Ball. Speaking of blasts…We had a wonderful visitation from the Buzzin’ Bees, resulting in 5 squares of rambunctious Ramblers and friends. Our caller Stephen Cole was stellar, as always, and we even danced overtime we were having so much fun. You should definitely mark January 9, 2021, on your calendar. This dance is not to be missed.
 
On February 8, we will be welcoming Dan Preedy to call for the Ramblers for the first time ever. We will dance Mainstream and Plus from 7:30 to 9:30 at the Oak Grove Community Center, 14496 SE Cedar Ave., Oak Grove, Oregon.
 
SYIAS!
