 Valley Squares visited Tri-Squares on December 13th and brought home a banner.  We all had a great time.

 Our February 15th dance will be a "Valentines Soup Dance" with soup at 6:30 pm in the dining hall, with our dance from 7-8:30 pm Mainstream (may vary) and 8:30-9:30 ish pm Plus.  Dessert will be served in the Grange Room upstairs during the dance.  Craig Abercrombie calling, Connie Clark cueing.  Come join us and enjoy soup, friendship and square dancing.
 Happy Valentines Day, see you in a square,
