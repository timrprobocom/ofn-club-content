Kenneth Eugene Pratt was born on December 27, 1951 in Hillsboro, Oregon, the oldest child of Glenn Eugene Pratt and Dorothy June Inkley Pratt.  He attended schools in Reedville and Aloha and graduated from Aloha High School in 1970.As a child he enjoyed camping and water skiing with his family.  He and his siblings learned to square dance with the Lads and Plaids in Banks, and Ken round danced with his mother in the 1960’s.

After graduation he joined the Navy and was stationed for a time in San Diego, and then shipped out to Hawaii.  The remainder of his 4 years of service was spent on a supply ship off the coast of Vietnam.  He achieved the rank of Boatswain’s Mate 3.

Ken married Trudy Faubion in 1976 in Gresham, and they had two children.  They later divorced.  During those years he lived in Aloha, Lincoln City, Kennewick, Gresham and Portland  He worked at Tube Forgings of America and in pest and weed control, and later went back to school for training as a computer programmer.  He graduated from Computer Career Institute in 1984 and worked as an AS400 mainframe computer programmer for 15 years.

He returned to square and round dancing in the early 1990’s, where he met Dianne Demmin Johnston.  They were married at Kinton Grange in Beaverton on June 29, 1997.  Ken and Dianne danced up through Phase 6 rounds.  In 2003 Ken was encouraged by several round dance leaders to become a cuer.  He learned quickly, and was very successful, since he was a “natural” at timing.  Ken and Dianne have taught all phases of rounds, at various times, at Kinton Grange, Oak Grove Community Center, Salem Square Dance Center, Sunset Promenaders in Hillsboro, and in Bend. For a time they led a high level round dance club, called Razz-Ma-Tazz Rounders. Ken loved teaching and was always encouraged the dancers to go on to higher levels.  He cued for many of the local square dance clubs, but Sunset Promenaders and Promenaders Plus were his home clubs.  He was vice president of ORDTA (Oregon Round Dance Teachers Association).

In 2016, Ken built a 17’ diameter Koi pond in their backyard, and continued to work on “pond projects” every summer.  He enjoyed watching the fish from our deck.  He enjoyed classic cars, and owned a 1953 Buick Roadmaster.  Recently Ken had taken up bowling again.  He was on 3 leagues, averaged in the 180’s, and helped coach in the youth bowling program on Saturday mornings.  Also, over the last several years, Ken and Dianne enjoyed travelling in their RV and visited a number of National Parks in the Southwest,California, Montana, and South Dakota.

Ken passed away early on the morning on New Year’s Day, 2020, of an apparent heart attack.  He is survived by his wife Dianne of Hillsboro, his daughter, Stacey Arnold (Mike) of Farmington, New Mexico, his son, Jeff (Karie) of Jefferson, OR; and by his step-daughters, Annette Christensen (Robin) of Aloha, and Valerie White (Darrell) of Reedville.

November 7, 1942 - November 23, 2019

Jim was born on November 7, 1942, in Portland, Oregon.  He grew up in Portland and joined the Navy after graduating from high school.  He married his wife Kay in 1963. They were separated the end of 1970’s and remarried in 1984. Jim is survived by his wife Kay, 4 daughters, 9 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren.  Jim and Kay joined all of their family this year in Seaside to celebrate Thanksgiving and their 56th wedding anniversary.  Jim passed away on November 23, 2019, when his heart failed during their family vacation.

Jim and Kay Rogers have dedicated almost half of their life to the promotion of square dancing in Oregon and Washington.  Separately and together they have held offices in their clubs, the TVC, the Oregon Federation of Square and Round Dance Clubs, and at the national level.  In the 28 years Jim and Kay have been dancing, they made square dancing a priority in their lives.  Following is a brief summary of some of the things they have done together and individually to promote and support square dancing.

* Jim & Kay have been members and officers in the Fireballs Square Dance Club (Scappoose, OR), RV8ers’ (Portland), Toe Draggers (Beaverton), and the Eager Beavers (Beaverton)
* Kay & Jim were President of the Tualatin Valley Council (TVC)
* Jim was State Delegate from the TVC to the Oregon Federation of Square and Round Dance Clubs (OFSRDC)
* Jim &  Kay have both been President of the OFSRDC
* Jim filled in as OFSRDC Insurance Chairman when Kay was President of the OFSRDC
* Kay & Jim co-chaired or chaired at least 4 Summer Festivals  (they even chaired a Summer Festival for Eastern Oregon and brought her committee with them when Eastern Oregon didn’t have enough people to host a Summer Festival)
* Kay & Jim co-chaired three USAWest Square Dance Conventions (2008, 2011, and 2014)
* Kay & Jim have been involved with at least 2 (1994 & 2005) National Square Dance Conventions (NSDC)
* Kay & Jim were part of the 2005 NSDC Trail Board and Chairman of Registration & Housing 
* Kay & Jim were the USDA (United Square Dancers of America) Western Region Vice-Presidents for 3 years
* Kay & Jim created and chaired the “Boots in the Blue Mountains”, a 3-day festival in Pendleton which happened 3 different years in April
* Kay & Jim received the TVC Recognition Award in 2005, as an acknowledgement and thank you for all that they did for square dancing in the TVC and throughout Oregon
* Kay & Jim received the Randall Award in 2007, the highest honor the OFSRDC bestows on dancer/couple who have done outstanding service for the OFSRDC and square dancing

Jim had a great sense of humor.  He loved his family and he loved teasing Kay.  He was usually quiet in public – but gave 110% support to Kay when she volunteered for another festival or convention driving Kay wherever she needed to go and helping her.  He will be missed.
