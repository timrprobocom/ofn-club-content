 Look for some pretty humorous photos in this issue taken when we had a sale of experienced dancers’ clothes.  A couple Oak Hills guys had a good time modeling the clothes (including some slips).  The guys realized it’s fun to twirl in the ‘big skirt!’
 Our February theme dance will be a Ground Hog Dance on February 3rd.  We will be watching for Punxsutawney Phil.  What’s special about that?  Come and check it out.
 Beginning mainstream dancers’ class will begin on February 10th, from 6:30 to 7:30.
 Please join TVC’s newest club on Mondays from 6:30 to 8:30.  The first Monday of the month is our theme dance and continues until 9:00, with mainstream dancing to all singing calls, phase two rounds and open break.
 Hang in there – the weather will get better!!
