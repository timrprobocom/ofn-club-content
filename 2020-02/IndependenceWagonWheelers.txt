Our New Dancer Class has graduated and we are so proud of them. We look forward to dancing with them as they continue to hone their new skills and share their enthusiasm at the joy of square dancing. Their energy, enthusiasm, positive attitude, and progress in dancing made our Sunday evening lessons a real delight and made the New Dancer Dances especially gratifying. Mid-Winter is an ideal opportunity for them to stretch their comfort zone, and we know they will rise to the occasion in spectacular fashion. The Salem Hospital venue was ideal for our lessons, and we are so thankful to Salem Hospital for permitting us to offer our lessons there.  Membership Coordinators Dave O’Neill and Lee Ashwill did an outstanding job of organizing the lessons. Club caller and class instructor George Hermann made the lessons fun while instilling an enthusiasm for square dancing and turning out another class of accomplished square dancers. 

 In January we learned that our annual December service project was a huge success. The proceeds from our successful Christmas Dance silent auction, which were donated to Windsor House, homes for brain injured adults, amounted to about $570, and we delivered over 50 cans of coffee. During December many IWW members daily set aside non-perishable food items as a Reverse Advent Calendar, which were then delivered the food to Windsor House to cap off our service project. 

Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays of each month at the Polk County Fairgrounds. Especially be sure that you mark your calendars for our special dances:  February 8 “Mix it up” Dance; March 8 (Sunday) IWW 60th Birthday Dance. Looking ahead, our Mystery trip is on February 22, the Annual Koast Krash is April 24 – 26 (Yachats Inn. Theme: At the Hop), and our Polk County Fair fund raiser is August 6 - 8.
