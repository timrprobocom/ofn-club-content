We held two fun-filled dances in December.  The first one on Dec. 13 was our annual Christmas Dinner and Dance with Jim Hattrick calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  The club provided a delicious ham cooked by our president, Larry Reetz.  The club members all brought scrumptious dishes to accompany the ham.  Jim called a great dance as always.  We were all saddened to hear that he had been hospitalized four days later for a bad gall bladder which was removed with complications.  We are all sending Jim our best thoughts and wishes for a speedy recovery and are hopeful he will be able to call our birthday dance this month on Feb. 14.  We love you, Jim!
 
At the end of the month on Dec. 27 K.C. Curtis and his wife Linda joined us along with cuer Judy Russell and her husband and caller Bruce Lowther for a fun time albeit a small crowd of dancers.  Too close to Christmas and just before the big NYE bash.  We will definitely go dark for the 4th Friday next December as it is Christmas Day!  Since we did not have any non-plus dancers in attendance, K.C. and Bruce graciously agreed to call plus the whole evening which made it double the fun indeed.  Thanks to both of them and also to Judy who filled in at the last minute for Jackie.  We all enjoyed her cueing very much.

On New Year's Eve quite a few Single Trees came out to the hall to celebrate with Roger Putzler, Christina Corelli and many of our dancing friends, including Fred and Carol Muir from Roseburg.  A fun time was had by all with party poppers, lots of pie and other goodies, and a toast with apple cider to ring in the new year.
 
See you in a square soon.
