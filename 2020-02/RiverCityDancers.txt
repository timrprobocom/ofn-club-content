We began the year 2020 with a 2020 vision dance as we took a good look into the future. Some members wore silly eye glasses and we also collected used eyeglasses to donate to the Lions Club.  Several of our members will also be attending Mid-Winter in Albany.

Our students are progressing very nicely. We have taken them to several new dancer jamborees and they are enthusiastic about square dancing. We will be holding a special dance in February, (on Saturday February 8) for their graduation. Whether you are a couple or a single, you are welcome to celebrate Valentine’s month with our special “Friendship Dance” and graduation. We will also be having a square dance clothing sale at that time. Come join us as we celebrate friendship.

Our second dance in February will be the third Saturday and is a regular dance.

In March, we will be celebrating St Patrick’s day on March 14 with the wearing of the green.  You will also see us out on our monthly club visitations. If you are missing some club banners, chances are good that we might have one of yours. Our welcome mat is always out and we love having visitors. Come dance with us as we celebrate friendship in February and through the year.

On January 31, our club hosted the PAC dance which was held at our hall.
