Happy New Year to all of our dancing friends. Our holidays were great with a free New Years Eve dance at our IOOF hall. Charlotte Jeskey, Jim Voll, Sandy Harris, and Bruce Lowther called the dance and Jackie Gale and Judy Russell cued. It was a wonderful way to spend New Yearâ€™s Eve. 
 
On January 4, our club had its Pajama Dance with lots of interesting sleep wear. Charlotte Jeskey was our caller and Jackie Gale was the cuer. There were prizes and our new dancers graduated during the evening. 

January 19 was our 71st Birthday Dance with lots of prizes and strawberry shortcake was served at the break.  We enjoyed seeing lots of our friends there to help us celebrate. 

Many of our club members will attending the Mid Winter Festival and we will be dancing on the first and third Saturdays of February. See you in a square!
