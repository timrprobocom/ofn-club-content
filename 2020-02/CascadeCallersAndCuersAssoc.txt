Happy New Year!  2020!  Wow, can you believe it?  I remember teaching music and the fun song to teach and sign was called "What'll We Do in the Year 2000, Many Long Years from Now."   And remember reading Orwell's 1984?
 
Our next scheduled dance is Saturday, February 29 (Leap Year!) at the dance center in Springfield.  The members of CCCA will call and cue a fun dance for you! The floor in our hall is cushioned and so nice to dance on.  The Eugene Opera is using our facility that day but will be finished in time for our CCCA meeting and dance.  Pre-Rounds start at 7:30 and squares are from 8:00 - 10:00.  Put this on your new calendars!
 
We had about five squares for the New Year's Eve dance with Roger and Christina. Lots of pies and other foods, but the best part was dancing with all of our friends and bringing in 2020!
 
Keep on calling and cueing for fun,
Christina Corelli
