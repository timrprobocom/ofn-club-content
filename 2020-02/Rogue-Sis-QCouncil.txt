Rogue Sis Q Council had the 2nd annual Pajamarama Student level dance with Richard Lane Calling and Rikki Lobato cueing.  The turn out of dancers was great, from advanced to beginner level dancers.  Richard challenged all levels of square dancers, and Rikki cued all levels of round dancing making this a true dance for all levels of dancers.  Hope you can come to the next Pajamarama dance in January 2021.

Our next dance is January 31 in Medford at Rogue Valley Square Dance Center.  See flyer in the OFN.

Our next meeting for the Rogue Sis Q Council is February 4th at 4:30pm, at Round Table Pizza in Medford.
