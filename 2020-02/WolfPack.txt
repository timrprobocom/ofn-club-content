Our dances are still very small but weâ€™re keeping our heads up and are hopeful that they turn around soon.
 
Hope everyone had a great holiday. Look forward to seeing some of you at Mid--Winter Festival.
 
Our 4th Saturday caller Lennie Ludiker will be cutting down some so when he is not available new caller Janet Geiger will call his dance.
 
Hope to see you at a Wolf Pack dance soon.
