Willamette Squares enjoyed its December dance. It was especially festive because of the holidays.

Just a reminder that Willamette Squares will be dark January 25 due to Mid-Winter Festival. We hope to see many of you there! In the meantime continue to ring in the new year! Happy dancing, everyone!
