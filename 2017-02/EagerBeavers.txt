Now is the time to sign up for Plus Lessons beginning February 13th from noon to 1:15 at the Sunset Presbyterian Church on Cornell Road.  This is your opportunity to progress to Plus, brush up on your dancing skills, or spend more time just dancing.  For $4 a lesson you get the best instruction from our excellent callers:  Daryl Clendenin, Darrell Kalmbach, and Jim Hattrick. See www.eagerbeavers.info or call Karen at 503-649-9487 or Sally 503-645-2414.
 If you come to the first lesson you can see our Valentine’s Day Celebration; The King and Queen of Hearts dance.  It is fun and you will be able to join us for the first tip. 
 We were dark on December 26th to give everyone a chance to recover from Christmas Dinner and enjoy time with family.
 The TVC New Year’s Dance had a slightly different format this year by having desserts at the break instead of a sit down dinner.  The dance ended after midnight so we had a chance to kiss the New Year in.
 Make sure to save the date for our Anniversary Dance, Sunday, April 23rd, IOOF Hall in Hillsboro.
 We dance on most holidays.  Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 to 3:00 p.m., at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.  Most holidays we dance at Aloha Grange.
 Please check for up to date information at www.eagerbeavers.info or OFN website: http://ofn.club.
