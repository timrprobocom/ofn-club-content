What a great Ugly Christmas Sweater Dance we had to finish the year!  Our biggest dance to date!  Our club worked together to decorate the hall and we had a wonderful dinner with many visitors.  Thank you to Kathy Roberts for the abundance of Christmas decorations!
 Winter has started off with a nice bang! Cold weather didn’t stop us from starting lessons.  All of our advertising is paying off!  We will not be hosting dances in January and February as we focus in on developing our new dancers.  We would love the help of other angels to come out on Wednesdays.  Our dances will resume on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday’s in March.  The first half student level dance, break then the remainder at Mainstream level until we are at full mainstream level with our new dancers.
 The Tualatin Timber Squares won the trophy from the Oakey Doaks with 62% of our members in attendance!  We will be hosting our trophy dance March 22nd in conjunction with our New Dancer Dance.  Students of other clubs will be counted towards that club’s percentage.  Please encourage your new dancers to come out and support our new dancers and see who wins the trophy!
 We will be celebrating our First Anniversary April 26th with a Black, Red, Silver theme (club colors).
