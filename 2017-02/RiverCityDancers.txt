As we head into January, River City Dancers are preparing for Class Graduation.  It consists of these steps:  River City members visit the class on January 8th; Class visits the club at our first dance in January (January 14th); then Class graduation January 22nd.  We greatly encourage our class to attend Mid-Winter Festival the weekend of January 27th.  

It’s a special honor and privilege to welcome our new dancers.  And a special thanks to all the “hard-badgers” who have been able to angel our class, and most special of all, a big hug of thanks to our Caller couple, Les and Paula Seeley.  It’s especially nostalgic hat this will be Les’ last class.

With tears of both joy and sadness, we look forward to Seeley’s “Retirement Dance” with the Crew, along with our Cuer couple, Tami Helms and Tim Keck, coming up on Sunday, February 12th, from 2:00 to 4:30.

One special River City Angel is Jolene Cummings, who is our club photographer, and, among other things, our “Honored Couple” editor for our newsletter.  For December, she picked Julius Smith and Phyllis Baldwin.  Julius is a special 95 years old now, grinning all the way, and partner Phyllis is right there, with him!  Square dancing is a healthy, smart sport,  if you can call it a “sport”.
