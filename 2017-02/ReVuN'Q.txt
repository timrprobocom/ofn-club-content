We are now into the New Year and the club brought the New Year into reality with a successful New Year’s Eve dance. Almost 20 couples were in attendance, which included the three cuers and spouses. Lots of food graced two tables in the hall. Four bottles of sparkling cider were served at midnight and the higher level of dancing went on while the rest of us cleaned up and got ready for the wet trip home. We appreciate the dancers who attended and enjoyed the friendship of those who were there. We have reserved the hall for another New Year’s Eve dance at the end of 2017. Hope you will join us.
January will be filled with workshops, working on our Showcase of Ideas demo for Mid-Winter, and just filling time with floor time. Nothing has been set in stone yet for what we are doing in February. Might just be more of the same. 
We dance on Thursdays at the SSDC and you are more than welcome to join us. Marilyn Schmit
