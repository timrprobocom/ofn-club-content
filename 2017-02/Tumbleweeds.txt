Tumbleweeds had to cancel 2 dances in December because of snow and ice.  You can call me at 503-252-7374 or Nunally at 503- 659-2270 if there is possible cancellation because of the weather..

We will be dark for the Winter Festival weekend.  Les Seeley will be calling his last dance for us in January.   Les and Paula are moving to Arizona to live.

The Tumbleweeds welcome  singles and couples.  We make sure all the singles get to dance.
