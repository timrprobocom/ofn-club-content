We had ten dancers graduate in December and three have joined the club. Classes will start up again in the fall.

Our first dance in January was in memory of Mary Phillips-Lewis who passed away last year.  She loved square dancing and was taken from us much too soon. 

Our third Saturday dance in February will have a Valentine theme. 

I have been informed that Beachcomberâ€™s in Port Orford will be starting round dance lessons in February with Dave Cooper teaching.  

Happy Dancing!
