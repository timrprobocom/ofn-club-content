Valley Squares had a quiet December because we cancelled our December 17th dance, thanks to snowy roads and chilly weather.  Brrr!  How much more is ahead?
 Our Mastering Mainstream lessons ended on Tuesday December 6th.  Darrell Kalmbach was an outstanding instructor and taught us from every position so we sharpened our minds and our skills.
 A lot of our members went to Columbia River's Beatles Dance featuring Mark Wheeler.  Although our Official Visitation was after Thanksgiving, enough members attended the Beatles extravaganza that we captured a banner.  
 Mark is planning a 60's Dance for us in the upcoming weeks.  Should be lots of fun.  Please join us.  We dance 1st & 3rd Saturdays at Aloha Grange, starting at 7 p.m.  Mainstream with every third tip Plus.  Hope to see you in a square.
