At our last dance in December, we graduated 13 beginning dancers. We are very excited that the majority of them decided to join the club and have continued attending in the New Year. The beginner and intermediate classes continue to practice the demo songs in preparation for our upcoming season as well as learning new dances each week.

We will be starting another class of beginners the second Tuesday in February and hoping to have as many if not more than we had for September's class.
We had our annual meeting on January 21 to discuss where the club is headed for 2017, discussing our financial position, the demo season and outfit, beginner classes etc.  Several members will be attending the clogging portion of mid winter. Georganne Pfnister
