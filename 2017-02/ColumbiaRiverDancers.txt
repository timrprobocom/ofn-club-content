We danced once in December, once in January and now we will be back to two dances in February.  My taw and I will have missed the Mid-winter fling with all of our friends as she prepares for that new hip.  We are aiming at maybe a tip at our 2nd Anniversary dance in March.  In the meantime, we have Craig Abercrombie calling and cueing at our February 11th dance and club caller Jim Hattrick doing the honors on the 25th.  Remember that our club tries to make sure everyone dances, so singles are welcome.
 New classes start the first Tuesday of each month. With the help of our wonderful angels, we are able to move our new dancers along quicker it seems than normal.  Many of our starters in November were dancing quite well at the beginning mainstream tips that Jim called at his dance on December 30th.  The front Porch Trio did the singing and many new dancers had the first tips to a new caller.
 I am still looking to see if there is any interest in a teen group in the Greater Portland area.  We have some young people who are now in mainstream or plus who need to dance with someone closer to their age instead of dancing with grandpa (yes, one of them is my granddaughter).  I know our club is not the only one out there with young people who would enjoy square dancing.  If there is interest, my email is nickandjan@comcast.net.
