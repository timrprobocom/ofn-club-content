In December the Toes have a club tradition.  We all head for the Kinton Grange and decorate the hall for the holidays then go out to dinner together.  Fun evening for us.  We chose not to cancel our first dance of December because of bad weather and found many dedicated square dancers joined us.  We had a turnout of 30 dancers.  Who would have guessed?  Another fun evening with great friends.  We did something new this year with attending the Tualatin Valley Community Band’s holiday concert.  Our club member, Tim Roberts plays in the band and we all had a wonderful start to the holidays, then went out to dinner afterwards.  Thanks Tim for the great opportunity to begin the holidays on a high note.
 Hope your New Year was a warm and toasty one.  Many went to the TVC dance that night.  Bev and Harlan Flint have announced they will not be teaching Round Dance lessons this year.  Both will be missed this January sharing their fun rhythms and dance experiences with us.  During January the Toes will be having an experienced clothing sale at both dances.  Hope you come and check it out.  Mainstream lessons resumed January 3rd and we are expecting our great group of new dancers to be ready for Mid-Winter Festival 2017.
 February starts out with our Heart and Roses Dance on the 3rd and the 17th for our regular dance.  Let’s leave our cold weather behind us by warming up our hearts and bodies to our great caller and cuer for the Toes, KC and Bev.  We do appreciate you and your spouses.  Let’s go forth into 2017 square dancing up a storm.
