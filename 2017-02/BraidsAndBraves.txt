On December 20, we had 27 members and students attend our wonderful Christmas Party at the home of our President Jennie Ramer, including a White Elephant gift exchange. A singing catfish and a set of rollerblades were among the gifts. After the gift exchange, Linton Allen played his ukulele to accompany Christmas carols sung by the group. We're looking forward to a New Year and, of course, Mid-Winter Festival. See you in a square. Carmen Rost
