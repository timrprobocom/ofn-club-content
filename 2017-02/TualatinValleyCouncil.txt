The last TVC dance of 2016 and the first dance of 2017 were both held over a 3 ½ hour period on December 31st.  Daryl and Yvonne Clendenin called and cued with help from Mike Stout, Janienne Alexander, and Julie Stout.  The IOOF Hall was rockin’ as we ushered in the New Year.  About ten squares signed up and paid in advance but nearly two squares were unable to make the dance due to weather conditions.  The Sunset Promenaders won the TVC Banner for highest percentage of their club in attendance.
 You may be reading this in late January so I will remind you of our annual TVC Presidents Meeting & Potluck.  It is to recognize current and past club Presidents and will be held at the IOOF Hall, 267 East Main Street, Hillsboro, OR 97123 on January 23rd.  There will be a potluck dinner starting at 6:00 and meeting at 7:00.  All TVC club Presidents & dancers are invited to join us.  The TVC wishes to thank all the presidents of the TVC Clubs for volunteering their time and efforts into this activity we all love.  Also, at this meeting the TVC President, Dale Brabham, will announce the winner of the Tualatin Valley Council “Recognition Award” for outstanding service and special contribution to the square dance community within the TVC geographical area.
