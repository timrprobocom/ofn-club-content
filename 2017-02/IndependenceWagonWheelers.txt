We hope all of our fellow dancers had a wonderful holiday season. Our club started our holiday activities by collecting cans of decaffeinated coffee for the Windsor House. Windsor House is a rehabilitation facility for brain injured adults. We managed to collect 51 cans.  We do this collection twice a year and the residents really appreciate this because otherwise they would only receive one cup of coffee a day. At our second dance, we held a silent auction, which had some very lively bidding. The proceeds also went to the Windsor House.  
We invited our new dancerâ€™s class to join us at our second dance and those dancers who did that seemed to really enjoy themselves.  Our class members, as well as our club members, are looking forward to the Mid-Winter Festival.  
We hope to see all or our dancing friends at the Mid-Winter Festival. Happy Dancing, Linda Neuschwander
