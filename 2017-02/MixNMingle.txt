December 17, 2016 is a good example of why almost every month I recommend checking our website to be sure that we are dancing.  With more snow forecast for late evening we felt that most people wouldn't want to risk going out.  I'm hoping for clear roads for all the dance nights in the coming year. 
 What about our Canned Food Dance, you ask?  We hope that everyone brings it to our next dance.  That is the advantage of having nonperishable items for those in need.  It will keep until the weather allows us to collect it and see that it goes to the Food Bank.
 Happy New Year and check our website!
