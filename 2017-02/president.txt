<p>What to write? Hmm. February means Valentine&rsquo;s Day, President holidays, recovering from Mid-Winter and getting steam built up for Summer Festival, second sessions of some classes and planning summer vacations with dancing involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I write this, I am huddled under a blanket keeping warm while it is cold outside. Thinking ahead to Mid-Winter activities for the various events I need to attend, meetings to be prepared for, and all the hugs I plan to collect from people I have not seen in a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How successful were your new dancers at Mid-Winter? Did they get enough dancing in, did they bring back any comments to your club that would be of use to others. Make sure you find out if they had a good time and were treated nicely by other dancers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As your club holds meetings and gets ready to elect officers, don&rsquo;t forget to fill out the form on the Federation website. It is from that form that the state directory is done, officers are known to contact for questions and answers from other dancers. It is important that your information is correct and up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your club has a website, make sure it is up to date also. Lots of dancers look for information and if the information is not correct, you might lose a visit from dancers who are looking for a place to dance when traveling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See you somewhere soon.</p>
