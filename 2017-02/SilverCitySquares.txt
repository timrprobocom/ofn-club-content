I hope everyone had some good holidays and that the weather didn't cause too much difficulty for anyone. Thank you to everyone who joined us at our January "Black Cat" dance on the 13th. Those who were there enjoyed dancing to Leonard and Frances. We did have a low turnout of our own club members as two of our couples were on a vacation trip to sunny Florida.

We are gearing up for practice for the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival. We are working a bit harder this year as we would really like to be defending champs when it comes to Oregon in 2018. We also have our raffle tickets available - catch one of us kids at a dance to get yours. Please save the date of March 24 for our fundraising dance and watch for more info to come.
