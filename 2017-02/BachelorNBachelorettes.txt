We’re sorry to announce the death (January 4) of long time member and former club president, Mel McLain.  Mel was also the PAC President in the 1980’s.

But on a lighter note, many are planning to come to the Bon Voyage Les Dance.  This will be the last dance Les Seeley is scheduled to call for us.  But if he dare shows up in town, our caller recruiter will undoubtedly hire him for another dance.

And the next week will be our Valentine’s Dance.  Bring your favorite date, or come to our club and find one.  Everyone will be kissing sweet.  Our Director of Oral Hygene, Marc McGargle, will be checking everyone at the door.

We’ll see you all at Mid-Winter
