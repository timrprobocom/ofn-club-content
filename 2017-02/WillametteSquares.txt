Willamette Squares had a quiet month in December what with our regularly scheduled 4th Saturday of the month being Christmas Eve. However, our new dancer dance was on January 8, 2017 at 1:30 at the Salem Square Dance Center!

The fourth Saturday of January, January 28, Willamette Squares will be dark because of Mid-Winter. We hope to see you all at our new dancer dance in the New Year and back with us on the 4th Saturday in February. Best wishes from Willamette Squares for the start of a new year offering plenty of opportunities for dancing! Jodee Howard
