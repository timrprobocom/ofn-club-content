Happy New Year, and may 2017 bring you many blessings!
	
	CCCA sponsored the New Year's Eve dance. Roger Putzler called, and Christina Corelli cued. There were about 6 plus squares and tons of pies and other goodies.  We celebrated four times. Once for New York City, once for Chicago (Roger was born and raised in Chicago.), once for Ontario, Oregon and then good o' Eugene/Springfield. We used a lot of poppers and had to sweep up after each celebration! We thank the dancers for helping clean up afterwards as well.  It was a FUN dance!  We danced one tip in 2017.
	
	Our next dance isn't until April 29. We dance the Fifth Saturdays from 7:30 - 10:00 with our meeting at 6:30.  
	
	One of our members, Kirby Goode (caller), remains on in home hospice care and is hanging in there.  Kirby and his wife, Christina Corelli, appreciate the emails, cards, phone calls, visits and people willing to stay with him while Christina runs errands and does a few things for herself.  Thank you! 
 
Keep em; dancin' and smilin'!
