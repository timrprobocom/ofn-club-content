We had a great turnout for our new dancers dance in December and our usual visit by Mr. and Mrs. Claus. Our second dance in Dec. was canceled due to weather concerns.
 
In January we enjoyed a Disney Dance and a Chili Feed dance. We would love to have you come and visit us often as we could certainly use your help to fill up our hall. Enjoy Mid-Winter Festival. Sandy
