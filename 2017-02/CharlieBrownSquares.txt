Wow!! What a crazy start to the New Year!! So many dance and class cancellations; I hope we are on the upswing of better weather, or at least weather that doesn’t cause us to miss dancing!!

The Charlie’s were dark for their Jan 7th dance in order to head up to Roseburg and dance to Mike Sikorsky. Unfortunately, Mike couldn’t make it down the I-5.

Our next dance will be this Sat Jan 21st. We have special guest caller George Hermann & guest cuer Patty Hermann!! We are excited to welcome them to Grants Pass!! This will be a Mainstream/Plus dance with rounds starting at 730pm. 

We started a new Mainstream class on Jan 12th with 15 students (8 adults/7 youth). Hopefully those 15 will come back and we will have an increase in class size over the next 2 free classes.

February we have dances on the 4th & 18th with our caller Ray Holmes. Guest cuer on the 4th is Mary Nutt and on the 18th is Mark McDonald.

Next week is MidWinter Festival, and I am so very excited to dance to Hunter Keller, Mike Seastrom and Sharon (Casey) Parker!!!  Hope to see many of our dance friends in Albany.

Safe travels & see you in a square!!
