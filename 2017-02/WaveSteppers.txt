The Wave Steppers’ free Wednesday night square dance classes resumed January 4th, after a 5 week break for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.  The classes are on the dance floor at the Tillamook Elks lodge, 1907 Third Street in downtown Tillamook.
 The Club’s 2017 dance season doesn’t begin until March, but we’ll be doing a square dance demo for the residents and staff of the Five Rivers retirement home in Tillamook in February.  It’s the second time the Wave Steppers have performed there.
 The Wave Steppers’ first dance of 2017, a St. Patrick’s Day dance, will be Saturday, March 11th on the big dance floor at Garibaldi City Hall, 107 6th Street (at Acacia), with club caller Joe Wrabek and line dance instructor Gwen Kiel.  (That’s the same weekend as the Championship Crab Races, one of the town’s biggest festivals.)  In April, the Club’s Spring Fling dance will feature Jim Hattrick as caller and cuer.
