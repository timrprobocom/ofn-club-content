<p>If your club changes its regular dance days, please take a moment to notify me. &nbsp;Let me explain why.</p>
<p>It's a bit tricky to come up with a way to allow you to edit and tweak every one of your dances, while still&nbsp;handling the normal dances for those clubs who don't regular make updates. &nbsp;In order to do that, I create entries for your regular dances 4 or 5 months ahead. &nbsp;If you change your regular dance day, those "made in advance" dance entries are still there with the old dates. &nbsp;If you are proficient with the computer, you can certainly go in and remove those entries and add your new ones, but it's generally easier just to contact me and have me fix them up directly.</p>
