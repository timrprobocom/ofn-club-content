Mid-Winter Festival will soon be behind us, and we hope all had an enjoyable time there!

February is very special for our club as it is the month of our Birthday Dance, on February 25! We'll be dark on February 11 for the Sweet Home Birthday Dance.

Thanks to all who have hosted the New Dancers' dances; they've been a lot of fun! We're looking forward to our coast trip March 10-12 at Gleneden Beach Community Club, and all are welcome! We're dancing there both Friday and Saturday nights. Karen
