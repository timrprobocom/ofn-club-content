We have been dancing the month away!  We took a large group down to Medford for the Midway Dance.  All of our students who traveled with us were able to earn their purple heart dangle during the dance…not to mention get in more floor time just in time for Mid-Winter.

January brings us to our New Dancer Dance. This is the perfect time to brush up on all the calls before you head to Albany for the Mid-Winter Party. This dance will be held on January 22, at 2:30 pm. The Umpqua Area Council is putting on this dance. If you are in the area, please join us at the barn for an afternoon of fun!

We welcomed in the New Year with a great dance. Everyone, including our new dancers, enjoyed a festive celebration.  Spending time with people you enjoy and dancing in the New Year is one of the best ways to spend New Year’s Eve!

Happy dancing,
Robin Faltersack
