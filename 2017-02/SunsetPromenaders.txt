At our December dances the weather outside was frightful but the dancers in the Hall were all feeling delightful. With Mike Stout’s energetic calling and Ken Pratt’s skillful cueing it put all the dancers in a festive mood, and also we were all so thankful for the visitors, too.  Also, on December 10th, 13 club members traveled to the Columbia River Dancers dance and had a great time dancing to Mike Stout and Ken Pratt.
 Our Promenaders Plus dances are on Thursday, February 2nd, and 16th with Darrell Kalmbach calling, and Ken Pratt cueing.
 The Sunset Promenaders dances are Saturdays February 4th, and 18th which are our Mainstream Dances.  With Mike Stout calling and Ken Pratt cueing, the theme for the dances is “Honoring Our Presidents”.
 Our Mainstream Classes have started on each Sunday, at the Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall from 4:00 to 6:00.  The classes are closed to new students except for previous dancers wanting to refresh their dancing skills.
