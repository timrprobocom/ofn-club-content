Brrr... Happy New year from the Bees. I am writing this in January and enjoying a forced stay-at-home day thanks to snow and freezing rain. We even had to cancel our dance last night for the safety of our members. I am hoping things clear up for our next dance because it's one of our favorites. It is our pajama dance. It is also our beginners Jamboree. The dance is on 1/21 / 17 at the Hazel Dell Grange. Pre-rounds start at 7:30 and squares start at 8. It is also our cuer's final  dance. Debbie Combs is retiring at the end of the month. We all wish her the best. I have greatly enjoyed having her as our cuer.

In February we only have one dance planned because our Hall is booked for the third Saturday of the month. The first Saturday of the month we have our annual pie eating contest. Mark that date on your calendar. Chocolate cream pie is what is served for the contest and we have lots of other pies for the break. Since our Hall is booked for the third Saturday of the month we plan a visitation.

Our students are coming to the end of lessons and we plan a graduation dance on Sunday February 5th at 6 p.m. at the Hazel Dell Grange.

Hope to see you in a square.

Debbie Broers
