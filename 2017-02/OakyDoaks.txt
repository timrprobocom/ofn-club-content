The Snow Miser has prevented the Oaky Doaks from getting together for a dance several times the last two months. He prevented us from getting together for our Holly Jolly Christmas Dance on the third Saturday in December as well our King of the Road Dance on the first Saturday in January. At the time of this report we are keeping our fingers crossed that he has had enough fun stopping us from having ours and will allow us to get together for our Pajama Dance on the third Saturday in January. 

Several of the Oaky Doaks will be ending the month of January by dancing at the mid-winter festival and so hopefully we will have gone beyond the Snow Miser’s interest for that weekend as well. 

On February 4th we start the month off with our annual Reigning Cats and Dogs Dance. We will be collecting donations of dry dog and cat food for Ani-Meals, a partnership with Clackamas County Social Services and Senior Meals programs to provide pet food for cats and dogs of seniors in need. Already-opened bags are welcome. We count the results and determine by weight whether cats or dogs are the 'winners' based on whether more cat or dog food is donated. Vote with your food for your favorite  - canine or feline.

We will also be playing BINGO for 15 prizes. Those interested in playing will be able to buy two BINGO cards for a dollar to try their luck at winning. 

February 18th will be our After Valentine's Dance - Breaking Up Is Hard To Do. Starry-eyed love songs take second place at this dance. We'll hear more of the variety of ways the downside of love is celebrated in song. Join us as we celebrate “Singles Awareness Day”.
