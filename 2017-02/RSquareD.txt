December brought to the area a winter wonderland of snow and Ice.  R Square D, for the love of the dance continued on with the toy dance on the 9th.  It was a dance for our beginners, B-51, and they too braved the weather to come out and celebrate the season.  Three squares kept the cold at bay as Craig Abercrombie and Lonnie Sycks keep everyone moving.  $350.00 dollars of toys were brought to the dance and donated to the Salvation Army the following Day.  Amazing!  Thank you to all that brought so that those who have little would be helped.  We had multiple visiting clubs that braved the cold to join us on the brisk evening. 
 R Square D had it Christmas Party, potluck and a short meeting on the 12th.  We have many talented dancers that bring home crafted items.  The fight to secure these items is always fun as we play it along with 3 steals for each item. The auction is always fun, every year. 
 February is the sweetheart month and we will celebrate it with a Valentines dance on the 10th.  The 25th finds us enjoying the dancing, with our new students, as they continue to learn at a B-51 dance.  The students that started in October are continuing on with mainstream.  Congratulations to them all.
