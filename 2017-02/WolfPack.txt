The snow and freezing weather, plus many people being under the weather has had an impact on the size of our lessons lately, and forced us to cancel our January dance as well.
	However, at our upcoming February 4th dance, we will be celebrating our 19th birthday. Back on February 14, 1998 we started our first set of lessons and eventually grew into a club. Doesn’t seem like that long ago, but as the saying goes, time flies when you’re having fun. We hope you can make it out to help us celebrate.
