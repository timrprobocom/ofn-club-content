Thank you to all of the dancers who kicked off the New Year with us by dancing plus and advanced until the clock struck 12. We had a blast and hope you did too.

On New Year’s Eve eve, we captured a banner from the Salem Swingin’ Stars. They are hereby challenged to reclaim it!

Lessons, which normally start the second Tuesday of February, will be delayed one week because of the Valentine’s Day holiday. Mainstream lessons will start at 6:30 and Advanced at 8:00. A collateral benefit of Randy’s lessons is that he teaches dance-by-definition so you can dance any part and get more floor time. Lessons are held at the Newberg Trailer Park Community Center on Illinois Street.

Our 4th Friday mainstream dance in February celebrates our anniversary. Come join the fun of dancing to Randy and Julie. Still only $5.00.
