We are dark in July and will have two dances in August.  August 6 will be Lennie Ludiker and Jackie Gale. Christina and Kirby will be in Penticton, BC for their annual square and round dance festival.  We encourage all dancers to go online and check out this fun PeachFest event.  Callers and cuers audition before being asked to go to their program.  Christina has been on their program since 1987 and has been emcee for the Roundoree round dance party three times.  Kirby has been emcee a number of times for one of the evening dances as well.  August 20 will be Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli calling and cueing.

The new dance season will begin September 17.  Dances will be held on the third Saturdays thereafter.  So, earmark your calendars for the third Saturdays for the 2016-2017 season.
 
Keep on dancing! 
Christina Corelli, Club Cuer
