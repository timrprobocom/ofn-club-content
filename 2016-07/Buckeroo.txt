This is sure a busy time of year here at the Buckaroo Barn! We have had graduation, preparation for the Round  Up, and are getting ready to dance at the fair. All of this in addition to our regular dances!

We celebrated our 64th birthday in April with Dale Roberson calling and Neil Koozer as our cuer. We had about eight squares out on the floor enjoying our Disney themed party! We also had our “After Taxes Dance” in April which was a lot of fun. In May, we had a regular dance on the 7th and our “Red, White, and Blue” dance on the 21st.
We had a large group of mainstream dancers graduate on May 19th. We are excited to see them doing so well out on the dance floor. We hope this is just the beginning of many enjoyable years of dancing for them.  Our plus graduation is coming up in June, but the group is doing an outstanding job and are ready to try their skills in plus tips at the Round Up.

We are planning a camp out in Port Orford for the end of June. The club there is having their birthday dance that we will be participating in. We will be dark in July, but hope to see everyone at Diamond Lake and at the Summer Festival in Seaside.

Happy Dancing,
Robin Faltersack
