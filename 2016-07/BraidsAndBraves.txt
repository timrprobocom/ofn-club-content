The Braids and Braves will be dark for June, July and August so our next dance will be September 17. We have several demos scheduled for this summer and we'll be out visiting other clubs as well. We are also planning a potluck in June and a camp-out in August. Have a great summer and we'll see you in a square. Carmen
