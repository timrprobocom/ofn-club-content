The theme of Willamette Squares monthly dance for May was "A Salute to the Armed Forces and Observance of Memorial Day." The seven veterans who attended were given recognition and thanked for their service. Others, both living and deceased, were also honored. There was a turn- out of two and a half squares. Some of our round dancers who graduated recently also attended our May dance. 

Thanks to Nancy and Gary Ohren who hosted our club meeting. It was a potluck, and we generated what we trust were good ideas for growing our club. Now to put them into action!  Jodee Howard
