During the month of May we enjoyed a terrific Cinco De Mayo dance.  The food and decorations were wonderful.  Then, on May 13, 36 of our members boarded a bus and traveled to Eugene as a raid on the combined dance that Single Trees and Whirl-A-Ways were hosting.  What a great dance and fun time was had by all of us.

As a reminder, Independence Wagon Wheelers will be dark during the month of August.  Starting with our dances in September, we will be changing our dance time to have pre-rounds (our first dance of the month) or pre-plus (our second dance of the month) at 7:00 p.m. and our dance will be held from 7:30 to 10:00 p.m. Happy Dancing.
