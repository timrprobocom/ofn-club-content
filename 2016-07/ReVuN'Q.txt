The club started out in June with 10.5 couples in attendance for our Tango lessons that are going on currently. We have learned Tango Manita and worked through another one but don’t remember the name. Cheryl started us on a third one also.

June 16 will be our 40th birthday dance with no lessons, just two hours of dancing and having fun. Maybe Cheryl will put on her “sister” so she can dance once in a while. We are hoping that previous cuers, the Walz’s and maybe the Ball’s will show up to have some fun with us also. 

We are considering rhythms for fall class and see what kind of other changes we need to make. So far, we are doing well and don’t want to mess up the progress we have made. Come and join us for some fun and learning. Marilyn Schmit
