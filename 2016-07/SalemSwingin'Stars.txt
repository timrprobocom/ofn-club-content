Happy Summer to all. We have been dancing in our air conditioned hall and we would love to have you join us.

June 8 was our Mainstream Graduation with 11 of our students in attendance. It was a fun evening of dancing, food and friendship as we put them through their paces with bags over their heads and ropes about their waists. Do you remember your Graduation? 

We visited the Independence Wagon Wheeler's on June 11 to get back one of our banners.

Our Red, White & Blue Dance is Friday July 1. Wear your best patriotic colors and come join the fun!  We dance the first and third Fridays of the month. 

Our 5th Friday dance is a Plus dance and that will be July 29. Pre-Rounds start at 7 p.m. with Jeanine Norden, Advanced at 7:30 p.m. with caller Randy Dibble, followed by Plus with Intermediate Rounds from 8-10:15 p.m. We will end the evening with another Advanced tip. See you all on the dance floor.
