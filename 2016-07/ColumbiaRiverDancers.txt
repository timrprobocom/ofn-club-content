July is the time of year to celebrate our country's birth.  It is also a time to relax and hit the beach.  Remember the Beach Boys and their surfing songs?  Well the Columbia River Dancers are celebrating those days at their July 9th dance with its “Summer Vacation is Here” theme.  K.C. Curtis will be calling.  Come casual.  Remember that we have plus dancing from 7 to 8 and mainstream from 8-10.
 Our own Jim Hattrick will be calling on the 23rd.  We are continuing with lessons on Tuesday evenings at 7 PM with five new dancers recently joining our club.  Jim workshops the students from wherever their skill level is so if anyone feels the need to hone their skills, this is the time and place to do it.
 Our 5/28 "Great Balls of Fur" dance was very successful with 9 squares and lots of dog and cat food donated to Second Chance Companion's AniMeal's program.  
 Also, we are planning a clothing resale, and will be advertising as soon as the details are worked out.  See you in a square.
