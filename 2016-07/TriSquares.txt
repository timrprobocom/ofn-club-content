The Tri Squares cancelled their 1st Saturday dance due to the heat. The club is currently working on our upcoming mystery trip, club picnic and fall lessons. 
 The Tri Squares has decided to go dark during the months of July and August due to the heat. Instead, we will be visiting other local clubs.  Visitations will mainly be clubs win the TVC area.  We’re looking forward to dancing with all of our friends this summer.
 On another note, we’re very proud of our club cuer Sandra Pinion.  Sandra has been pursuing college and faithfully serving our club.  She has finished her Bachelor’s Degree and will be teaching in her local community next fall.  Congratulations Sandra!
