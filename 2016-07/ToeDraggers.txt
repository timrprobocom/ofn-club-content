We started out the month of May by visiting the Sunset Promenaders on May 7th.  It was a fun evening, dancing to great callers and cuers. They always put on a relaxing and fun dance.
 KC and Linda gave us the best time for our Mystery Trip.  We drove to the east side of town, had an excellent dinner together at Xavier’s out in Gresham, given $ to go buy canned food to take to the SnoCap Food Bank Organization of Gresham.  Took a dance swirl or two at their facility, leaving our canned goods and drove on over to River City Dancers, ending our time dancing with new and old friends.  What a great Mystery Trip KC and Linda.
 I wanted to mention we have made one change for our 2nd dance of the month.  We have pre-plus at the beginning of our dance and changed the time for a plus tip to earlier in the evening instead of right before the break and have found more folks joining in with us.
 River City Dancers came on June 3rd, bringing much fun and enthusiasm with them for their visitation of the month.  
 On our dance July 1st, we will celebrate KC’s birthday.  It’s always a fun evening starting out with a BBQ at 6:30 p.m. downstairs at the grange and dancing away the evening to great music with KC and Bev leading the way.
Join us Aug. 5th for our Hot August Nights Dance with all singing calls from KC.  See you in a Square.
