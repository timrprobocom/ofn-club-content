We have a new/old board willing to serve another fun year of dancing.  The new/old board consists of Dave Lajoie, President; Kurt Jensen, President of Vice; Lorna Mercer, Treasurer; Christina Corelli, Member-at-Large; and our new board member, Cheryl Hagey, secretary.  The board meets monthly at Kirby and Christina's in north Eugene.  We may do a few board meetings  closer to Albany where Tim and Cheryl live.  Tim and Cheryl drive to the hall every Sunday and are responsible for bringing Molly Dodge from Sweet Home.  One of our regulars, Patrick, moved from southern Oregon to Lebenon and brings Molly to dances with him.  We are slowly building our club which is wonderful.

With that said, we dance Sunday from 5:30 - 8:00 p.m.  Tim Matteson, our caller, can teach and call all levels from Beginners through Advanced. We dance at the Emerald Empire Square Dance Hall in Springfield which has a cushioned wood floor and is air conditioned.    We are dark July 3 and August 14. 
 
Happy dancing,
Christina Corelli, Member-at-Large
