There’s no club quite like the B&B’s, especially in the summer when we attract so many visitors whose own clubs don’t dance over the summer.  Just to eavesdrop on conversations can be merriment.  Some of them seem to reflect our earlier days of strictly a solo’s club:

“It’s break time, but I know your lovely eyes will be the banquet of my evening.”

“The ones with their noses in the air are the easiest to hook”

“Are you a full-blooded American?”
   “I was before that transfusion last week.”

“Are you forgetting you’re married?”
   “I’m doing my best.”

“I hear you buried your husband?”
   “Yes, but he died first.”

“Is it true that the President of the B&B’s is the presumptive President of the PAC?”
   “Well, let’s say he’s he’s quite presumptive.”

So, particularly, if you haven’t anything to do, and an evening to do it, come on over to the B&B’s any Wednesday night and eavesdrop on the merriment.  On the 20th, you will have an opportunity to dance to your favorite Christmas carols on our Christmas in July dance.  Craig Abercrombie and Tami Helms will be providing the entertainment.
