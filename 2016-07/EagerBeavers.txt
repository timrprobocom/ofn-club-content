As you know our Memorial Day Dance was scheduled at the Aloha Grange at 1:00 pm instead of Sunset Presbyterian Church.  An amazing number of dancers and students came.  I think we had six squares dancing at one point.  The Hoedowners even received a banner for having eleven members at the dance.  Thank you to all of our guests who helped make this a wonderful afternoon.
 NOTE CHANGE: June 27th our dance will be at the Aloha Grange because The Sunset Presbyterian Church is unavailable.
 BIG NEWS!  We will NOT be dancing on Monday, July 4th.  Normally we dance on all holidays but we will be dark to allow time with families and parades.  Also, the Church is not available. 
 The following officers were elected and were installed June 4th: Chief Dam Builder, Sally Duyck; Assistant Dam Builder, Karen and Ferrous Steinka; Thumper, Leslie Tallman; Gnawer, Mike Duyck; and TVC Representative, Kay Rogers.  
 Plus Classes are continuing and students are making excellent progress.  We will keep going until the dancers feel confident they can dance anywhere with different callers.  Special thanks to those who show up to angel and bring in snacks for all to enjoy.
 Our annual picnic at Noble Woods Park is planned for August 10th.  It is potluck lunch with games and lots of conversation.  All are welcome.  
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons: Rounds 1:00 - 1:30 (Rounds will start at 1:15 during lessons); Plus 1:30 - 3:15 PM, Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.  We dance on most holidays too so if you have a day off come join us.
