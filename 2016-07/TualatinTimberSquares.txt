Our first club report!  Thank you to the TVC and the Federation for welcoming us with open arms as the newest club in Oregon!  We are enjoying all the new dancers and the Angels who come out to dance with us on the 2nd & 4th Wednesdays at the Winona Grange in Tualatin.  We started a new round of lessons the month of June and will continue through August.  Please visit our website www.TualatinDance.com for more information.  See you across the square!
