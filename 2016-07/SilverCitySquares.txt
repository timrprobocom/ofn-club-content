Many of our club members are doing vacations and visitations over the summer but we really enjoyed dancing in the Starlight Parade in Portland.

Now for the GREAT NEWS!!! Mark your calendars for May 2018. The exact dates will be confirmed soon (hopefully by this fall). The Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival is coming to Oregon again!  Mom (Karyn Buchheit) was given the coordinator's job for the 2018 Festival. We will also be finding out later if Mom will have it again in 2019. See you at a dance soon. Note: We also have the 2017 Festival pins for sale (they gave them out at the meeting on June 5.) They look tye-dyed this time. Petrina Buchheit
