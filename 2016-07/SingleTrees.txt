On May 13th we had our Mexican Fiesta dance.  The Whirl-A-Ways combined with us this year as we danced to George Hermann and Mike Kious. But we also had a big surprise that increased our numbers from 50 to over 100! The Independence Wagon Wheelers showed up en mass and filled our hall to capacity. We had a yummy taco bar at the break and stretched it to work - and everyone had their fill.  Thanks to everyone who helped in the kitchen! We had an amazing time.

On May 27th Lennie Ludiker called for us and as always, we had another really good dance with lots of guests, especially those that dance with Boots and Sandals from the Cottage Grove area.

Our potluck club picnic is on Sunday, June 26th from noon to 3:30 or 4:00 p.m., weather permitting, at Suzanne's country house and lovely grounds.  In July our club will be dancing to the calling of Terry Halley on the 8th at our Hawaiian Beach Party Dance. Wear your Hawaiian shirts and dresses and bring some beach-type snacks. On the 22nd, Lennie Ludiker will be back to call for us again. We hope to have lots of guests from other clubs who are dark for the summer.
