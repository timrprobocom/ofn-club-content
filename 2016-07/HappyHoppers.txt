The Happy Hoppers are having a hiatus.  We've gone "dark" for the summer season until September, when our dances and lessons will resume. 
The only planned activity is our club picnic at Don and Joanne Oja's farm on August 7.

In the meantime, the near-term and long-term future of our venue, the Clark County Square Dance Center is quite up in the air.  A sale is still pending, but the property boundary lines are not where everybody thought they were.  Last I heard, the attorneys were petitioning the court talking about something called "adverse possession".
