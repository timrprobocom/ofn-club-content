On July 2, 2016, the Country Cut-Ups will be reaching out to the surrounding communities to come to the Boring Barn for a picnic, games, and a free square dance lesson. This will precede our usual mainstream dance. The picnic will start at 5:00 PM and the lesson at 6:30 PM and the dance at 7:30 PM. The goal is to help the community become more aware of the Barn and what we do there, and also to promote interest in square dancing as we gear up for fall lessons. Come out and have a hamburger or hot dog and bring your friends and neighbors. For more details, see our flyer in this issue. 

Some of our members will be attending the Summer Festival in Seaside, but for all of you who stay in town, we will be having our usual 5th Saturday dance. We are now doing all plus level dancing on 5th Saturdays. Craig Abercrombie will be calling this and Stephanie Lezano will be cueing, starting at 7:00 PM.

For those of you who feel a little rusty with Plus dancing, want to stretch your skills, or just get more floor time, come to our Thursday evening Plus workshops with Scott Zinser, 7:30-9:30 PM at the Barn.

There was an error in my last report that needs to be corrected. Our club is planning to move our dance nights to 1st, 4th , and 5th Saturdays in 2017, not 2016. For now, we are at the Boring Barn, dancing every 1st, 3rd, and 5th Saturdays in 2016, with the exception of New Yearâ€™s Eve. This is a fifth Saturday this year, but it has been canceled. Sorry, for any confusion that error may have caused.
