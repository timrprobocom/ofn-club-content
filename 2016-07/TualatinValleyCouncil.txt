At the TVC meeting in May the slate of elected officers were installed: President, Dale Brabham; Vice-President, Kathy Roberts; and Secretary, Andis Geruts; with Treasurer, Lane Clem continuing his role from last year.  The new State Delegate is Jim Rogers.  Outgoing officers were Gary Clark, Dale Brabham, Tom Sminia, and Kathy Worthington.  Thank you for your dedication.  The first action our new President performed was to appoint volunteer Carolene Seibert as TVC Treasurer.  Lane will provide interim assistance.  Dale then accepted a petition for membership from the Tualatin Timber Squares.  The Council voted unanimously to welcome them into the Council.  Tualatin Timber Squares are a new club, dancing at the Winona Grange on 2nd and 4th Wednesdays with Janienne Alexander calling.  For details see:  www.tualatindance.com
