When our cuer, Jeanine Norden, couldn't cue for us on our second dance in May, we tried to find someone else to help out, to no avail.  Randy came to the rescue with recordings given to him by Jeanine and Janne Norton.  The dancers seemed to appreciate having those to dance to, and an enjoyable evening was had by all.
 As this is being written the forecast is for weather in the 90s on our dance night.  I hope that everyone is keeping an eye on our website for cancellations due to difficult temperatures.
