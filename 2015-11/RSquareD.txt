R Square D welcomed guest callers Renee Rudd and Les Seeley along with spouses Gary and Paula to our Boxcar boogie dance on the 11th of September. Best hobo costumes were Mary McDaniel and Marv Pope for the second year in a row.   Although the dance hall was warm a lot of fun was had by dancers form Cougar Squares, Flutter Wheels and Happy Hoppers.  Chile and Cornbread was served at the end of the dance and dancers left into the night with a full belly and a warm summer breeze to see them home. 
 The clubs yearly campout at Vista Park in Cathlamet was the weekend of September 18th, lots of good memories created.  I hear Lonnie Sycks isn’t going to be riding with his wife Linda in the motor home again soon.  We thank Ron and Lynn Waliezer for hosting our monthly meeting in their home. 
 Please come dance with us in November, the 13th we celebrate our veterans and on the 28th we will be kicking up our heals along to some good old Gospel tunes. 
 Get out and dance.  For more information about the R Square D club please visit our website at www.r-square-d.info or friend us on Facebook.    Caller- Craig Abercrombie, Cuer- Lonnie Sycks
