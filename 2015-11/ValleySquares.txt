Please join us for our Trophy Dance/Honor Our Veterans Dance November 7th.  Capture the Traveling Trophy by having the highest percentage of club members present.  We realize this is Royal Romp weekend, but hope you can still recross the river for what will be a fun dance.  Our caller that evening will be Ian Craig, with Connie Clark doing the cueing.  
 Our Thanksgiving Turkey Dance is Saturday, November 21.  We will start our Toy Drive and the Canned Food Drive at that dance.  Help us express our gratitude for the gift of square dancing - fellowship, exercise, fun!  Please help other families lessen their burdens over the holiday and increase their joy through your generous contributions.
 Our first Chicken Barbecue before the Tailgate Dance was a great meal at a reasonable price.  Tony and Joy Choy, Larry Siemer, and Angus & Lynn McCamant concocted some yummy barbecue recipes and cooked most of the chicken on site.  The salads were very tasty and the cookies fattening but hard to resist.
 We started our Mastering Mainstream and Beginning Plus lessons in September and students are progressing while having fun.  We had great visitations to Hoedowners and Rosetown Ramblers, and enjoyed our Back to School Dance where once again, members and guests were so generous donating school supplies. 
 See you in a square!
