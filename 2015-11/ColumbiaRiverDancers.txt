There have been some really great dance opportunities this fall, and we sure wish we could find a cloning machine so we could attend them all.
 In September, we managed to fit in 2 visitations.  We attended the Toe Draggers Anniversary dance and also attended Buzzin' Bees first dance of the season, which was Caller Bill Lundin's last dance as he is retiring from calling for the Bees.  Both dances were a lot of fun and we are very glad we went!
 Our dance on September 22nd was called by Renee Ruud with backup from Les Seeley, with Dorothy Lowder cuing.  This was our biggest dance so far, with 64 people in attendance!  WOW!  It was one of those dances that you don't want to end and that is talked about long after it's over.  We can only hope for more dances like this one.  Thanks to Renee, Les, and Dorothy!  And thank you to our guests, including the River City Dancers, the Silver Stars, the Country Cut-ups, and many others clubs for adding to the fun.
 Jim Hattrick is doing a phenomenal job of teaching our lessons, and Mark Wheeler is assisting while learning the ways of “The Master” (Jim).  We are following the same lesson cycle as the Happy Hoppers and hope that this will encourage students to double-up on lessons.
 At the time of this writing, we look forward to October and November dances and have quite a variety of Callers and Cuers lined up, including KC Curtis with Bev Flint, Randy Dibble with Debbie Combs, Mike & Julie Stout, and Jim Hattrick.  We truly appreciate our very talented Guest Callers and Cuers and the time and effort they put into preparing for and performing at our dances!
