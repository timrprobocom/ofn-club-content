Anyone who thinks square dancers are stodgy, stuck-in-the-mud, boring folks should have seen the bumper sticker on the car parked next to us last Saturday night at “R Square D’s” OctoberFest.  It read…if I may quote:

“Square Dancing is the most fun you can have with your clothes on!”

“Oh, really?” we thought, winking at each other.  “We’ve known that for a long time!”

Rocky and I enjoyed a fabulous weekend on our official River City Dancers October visitation.  One fun aspect is that we see dancers whom we rarely encounter, in Kelso, Washington, at the Rose Valley Grange.  It was their nineteenth anniversary, and somewhere around that number for myself and my late husband, Leonard, and now with my partner, Rocky Curtis.  It has become a tradition.  We don’t even have to think about it anymore…it’s the first weekend in October, when we follow our beloved callers, Les Seeley, his wife Paula, Co-caller Rene’ Rudd and her husband Gary, plus our equally beloved cuer, Tami Helms and her partner, Tim Keck. 

River City Riders had a small corral on that compact dance floor, but they danced fabulously, as always.  Few dancers have ever been bumped by the “knitted tail” of a horse, or swished through a barnyard of floating horse feather “poopies” later.

Thank you, R Square D’s, for another fun, friendly weekend.  You are the epitome of all that square dancers have always been, neighbors to the north:  a sharing, loving group:  carriers of heartfelt old traditions; creators of new.

The month is young as I write!  Some of us River City Dancers are going to play hooky and miss our second dance of the month to visit the coast for the Seaside Sashay.  We’ll end our month at the Landmark Inn in the southern end of Lincoln City for our annual beach trip.

Life is best when it’s shared with friends and family!
