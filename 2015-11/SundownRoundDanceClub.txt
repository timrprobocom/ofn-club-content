Sundown Round Dance Club of Bend  had their "Old Time Rock and Roll " Dance on October 12th, at the Pine Forest Grange Hall in Bend.  We danced to the sounds of the 50's & 60's, with Mark McDonald cueing & his wife (Bobbi) & daughter (Jessi)  helping out.  We had a great turnout, as well as our new Two Step students came and got to dance several old time songs from years gone by. Danny Zuko and a couple of the Pink Ladies also showed up. Sundown Round Dance Club dances on the 2nd Monday of each month at the Pine Forest Grange Hall in Bend from 6:30 - 9:00 p.m.  We would love to have you join us for a great dance and fun times. 
Hope to see you at our next Dance.
