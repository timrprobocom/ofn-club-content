Our council has two agenda items we are working on:

(1)	 We need to replenish our treasury.  We give a lot of money to worthwhile activities, such as the youth festivals.  We ask all of our domain clubs to come up with ideas on fundraising.
(2)	Weâ€™re very serious about wanting to help our domain clubs, and are soliciting input on how our council may help them.
