The Ramblers look forward to closing 2015 with a bang, with two of our heavy-hitter callers coming up. On November 7, we will be dancing to Gary Monday from Seattle. Gary is one of our most popular guest callers. He’s been calling since 1984 -- starting when he was barely out of high school -- and he can call fast or slow and to all styles of music. He is also a great teacher and the club caller for Puddletown Squares in Seattle. Join us at the Milwaukie Grange at 7 p.m. on Saturday November 7 (first Saturday), and we guarantee you will not be disappointed. We alternate Mainstream and Plus tips until 9:30 -- no round dancing.
 
On December 5, we will welcome Anne Uebelacker from north of the border in Vancouver, BC. Anne is a regular caller for the Squares Across the Border club in Vancouver. She’s been calling since 1977. Her choreography is always interesting, and her relaxed style and easy listening voice have won her many square dance friends at all dancing levels. She has called all over North America, Europe, and Japan. This is a great opportunity to dance to one of the greats -- from 7 to 9:30 p.m. at the Milwaukie Grange.
 
SYIAS!
