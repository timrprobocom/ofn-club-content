Busy month of dancing in September for the Toes.  We had 16 squares of dancers for our 40th anniversary dance.  Thanks to all of you that came out to support us.  We followed up the next week with our special dance, “Are You Man Enough to Wear Pink?”   Thank you to everyone that helped to make our dance a tremendous success with almost $2000 donated to the Susan G. Komen Foundation, to help us find a cure for cancer.
 This is the month to collect food for our canned food drive.   Come join in on the fun and opportunity to help us fill our food boxes to overflowing.  The food will be donated to local families in need.
 Nov. 14th is our annual club Progressive Dinner, with a Great Gatsby theme of the roaring twenties.  Should be fun.
 Our New Dancer’s Jamboree is this month.  Check flyers for date and time.  Hope you’ll come and bring your new square dancers.  We have a fun dance planned for everyone.
 Nov. 20th is a regular dance for us and on the 29th our whole club turns out to help decorate the grange for Christmas and go out to dinner together afterwards.  Christmas did I really say that?  How time flies when you are having fun.
