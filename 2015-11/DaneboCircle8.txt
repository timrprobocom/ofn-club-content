A new dance season is in full swing.  In October we had a fun Mask dance.  It's amazing the creativity of our dancers.  Roger Putzler called this dance.  Lennie Ludiker and Jim Voll call for us as well.  We are lucky to have them available.  Our dances are always a lot of FUN!  December 19 we are having a special Christmas dance along with the Whirl-A-Ways and Single Trees.  Mike Kious and Roger Putzler will call.  Christina Corelli is cueing.  Roger usually calls the first Saturday of each month. 
 
Keep on dancin'
