We will be marching in the Veteran’s Day Parade again this year and all square dancers are welcome to come and join us.  We meet behind the Douglas County Court House at 10:30 on November 11th.  Please wear square dance attire, or western wear.  (We try to wear red, white and/or blue.)  It’s a fun parade and a great way to honor the men and women who have served  our country. Mark the date on your calendar and come and join us on the parade route.
