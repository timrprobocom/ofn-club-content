The Muddy Frogs are well into square dance lessons and having fun with Bill Reid at the helm.  They are still being held at the Community Building in Milton-Freewater on Sunday afternoons from 2:00-3:30, with jive/swing ballroom lessons being taught from 3:45-5:00 by Neva Reid.  The Reids are officially living at their home on Wallowa Lake.  What a gorgeous view they have!

On November 15, the Frogs will host their annual Thanksgiving dance at the Community Building from 3:00-5:00, with a turkey dinner and all the trimmings to follow.  Bring a dish to share and your appetite!

A very Happy Thanksgiving to you all from the Frogs, who hope you will come hopping along with us!
