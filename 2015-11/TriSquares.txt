The Tri Squares danced away the month of September.  Lessons are taking off with many students and angels.  Round dance lessons are being held by Sandra Pinion and square dancing with Terry Halley.  Our second set of lessons will be held during the month of January.  This will include moves past B-51.  We would love to see new and old faces at our events.   Square dancers from all areas enhance our overall experience.  Dancing with others also strengthens one anotherâ€™s skills. 
 Tri Squares recently enjoyed an Apple Fest Dance during the month of September.  The dance was filled with great music and an abundance of laughter.  During the month of November our dance dates will be on November 7th and November 20th.  We encourage all to join us on our ""Western Wandering" dance on the 7th of November.  We also encourage you to join us on the 20th of November for our "Give Thanks...for PIE!" dance!  Make sure to show up ready and to dance followed by fun and fellowship!  Our dance schedules starts at 7:30 PM, We begin with 15 minutes of pre-rounds and 15 minutes of plus.  At 8PM we will start mainstream with every fourth tip plus. 
 See you at the dance!
