Well, my request for feedback last month produced a few comments, but
nothing that will require me to redesign the magazine.

I have received one or two inquiries about getting the OFN in printed form.
What you are reading here is just an ordinary web page, and can be printed
like any other web page.  It ends up being a LOT of pages, but it can
be printed.

The printed OFN used to have a "Solo Corner", with news and items of interest
to the single square dancer.  If you are interested in being the roving 
representative of the singles community and writing a monthly column, do let 
me know.  I'll make a place for you.

It's not too early to start making your New Year's Eve plans.  Many clubs and
councils are doing New Year's Eve dances, and they often sell out because of
their popularity.
