Here at the Buckeroo Barn summer is winding down and fall has set in.  Fun was had by all with Dale Roberson calling our casual dance on the 5th of September. We had a nice crowd and everyone left with a smile on their face. We joined up again on the 19th with Lenny Ludiker calling our “Dog Days of Summer” dance. 

Mid-September we started our mainstream lessons. We have 24 new dancers that we are enjoying getting to know. We all look forward to sharing our love of dancing with them and are excited to see them on the dance floor in the coming months! We have also begun our round dance lessons.

Come enjoy the beautiful Umpqua Valley and dance with us at the Buckeroo Barn. We love to have visitors and our Thanksgiving Potluck and Dance is just around the corner!

Happy dancing,
Robin Faltersack
