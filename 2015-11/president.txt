I am looking forward to the coming year serving as Federation president. My 
goal is to improve communication between the Federation and individual 
dancers and clubs.
<p>
You are invited to send me your questions or suggestions regarding how
we can better serve the dancing community. You can send them to me here
at the OFN or privately by email. Each club has a delegate who attends
council meetings and a council delegate attending state meetings. You
can send your questions or suggestions through your delegates, or attend
the meetings yourself. All of our meetings are open.
