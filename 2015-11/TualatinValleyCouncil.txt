Since the OFN is published mid month, you still have time to consider the Tri-Council Dance on Halloween night.  This fifth Saturday dance will be held at the Clark County Square Dance Center in Vancouver Washington and will be hosted by the Portland Area Council (PAC).  The featured caller will be Darrell Kalmbach with Molly Combs cueing.  Costumes are encouraged but optional.  Be sure to sign in as TVC,  there is always competition as to which Council has the best attendance.
