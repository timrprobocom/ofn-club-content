The Valley River Dancers welcomed autumn with mainstream and advanced lessons, workshops and a sock-hopping 50s dance.

Plans are already underway for our annual gospel dance the Friday after Thanksgiving. And, watch for a flyer announcing details of our New Years Eve plus gala (with every third tip A).

Happy thoughts follow our caller Randy Dibble on his gig in San Diego this month. No worries though--he and Sharon will be back for our Plus dance Friday, Nov. 13.
