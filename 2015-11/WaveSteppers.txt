Following the Fall Dance in October, the Wave Steppers will take a break for the winter.  The club won’t be entirely dark, however.  A new round of square dance classes starts Wednesday, January 13, at the Elks Lodge in downtown Tillamook; the classes, taught by club caller Joe Wrabek, run 6-8 p.m., and are absolutely free.  (Joe even brings homemade cookies.)
 For 2016, the Wave Steppers will be having eight dances, on the second Saturdays of March, April, May, June, July, August, September, and October.  Out-of-town callers that have been approached include Jim Hattrick, Darrell Kalmbach, Mark Wheeler, and Harvey Hunsucker, and cuer Connie Clark; other dances will have club caller Joe Wrabek.
 The Wave Steppers’ dances are held at Garibaldi City Hall.  About two-thirds of the second floor of the building is a dance floor, built in the 1940s for the old Firemen’s Balls.  The Garibaldi House hotel, half a block away, offers a discount to dancers.
