Independence Wagon Wheelers started the dance season with a very successful "Sock Hop". We had five squares dancing, root beer floats and popcorn popping. It was great! 

We started our lessons on September 13 with 13 new dancers. They are learning fast and everyone is having fun. We also did two demo dances in September; the first one at the Salem Hospital during their Diversity Days on September 17 and then the second one was September 24, for The Madrona Hills Retirement Center. We had a wonderful time and lots of people watching at both of these demos. 

Our next big dance night will be our Christmas Dance on December 12. This will be our New Dancer Dance and Silent Auction, and also a stuffed animal dance. The animals will be used as decorations and then they will be given to the Sheriff's Department. Please come and join us for this dance as we always have a good time and lots of good food. 

Remember, we dance the first and second Saturday's at the Polk County Fairgrounds. See you in a square. Sandy Eddings
