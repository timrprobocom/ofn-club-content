We had a really great dance Month in September.  We kicked off with our annual Back to School Sock Hop with George Hermann calling and our club cuer Jackie Gale cueing.  We honored Jackie with cake and ice cream for committing to being our club cuer.  What a gem she is!  George kept up the pace and looked every bit like he had stepped out of the 50's.  How fun!  What made it even more fun was the visitation by some members of the the Mid-Winter Festival Committee.  Thanks, guys!

Craig Abercrombie called for us on the 4th Friday in September and as always chose great music to dance to.  We always enjoy his calling and look forward to having him back again at the end of November along with Don Marshall who will call on the 2nd Friday.. 

The last Saturday night a group of Single Trees went up to welcome Jim Hattrick back to calling at the fun dance held by Corvallis Squares.  We came away with a banner!  What a deal! and what a cordial club
