As we get ready to celebrate fall and the changing of the colors, the club continues to work on various waltz moves that create problems when dancing. A tip here and there will help us look much better in the long run. We are enjoying the fun and friendship with those dancers who show up each week. We did not get any new class members, so we are work shopping more than having a class this fall.
By the time this is printed online, we will be a few days away from our Halloween party dance and telling Virginia Walz happy birthday on the 31st. Please send good thoughts to her as she prepares for knee replacement on November 16. 
We will possibly be working on a group presentation for the Mid-Winter Showcase of Rounds. There will be more news next month. Kind of hard to report on something that has not been fully decided yet.
Hope your holiday season is filled with family, food, fun and rest. From all of us to all of you, Happy Thanksgiving, and enjoy your early Christmas shopping. Marilyn Schmit
