September was an exciting month for the Braids and Braves. Nine members attended the Toe Draggers' 40th anniversary Dance and retrieved a club banner! The following Saturday, seven of our members attended the Toes' “'Are You Man enough to Wear Pink?” Dance benefiting the Susan Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Fun dances! 
Our Football dance in October featured team logo items from five professional teams and both Oregon universities, contributed by members. We had three squares dancing and welcomed three new club members. Everyone is encouraged to attend the Mid-Willamette Area Dance on Halloween. Keep dancing and laughing. It’s contagious.
