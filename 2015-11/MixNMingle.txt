What a joy to have our new plumbing installed and functioning, even though it took longer than expected!   The rooms have been redone to live up to the new fixtures.  There is even a drinking fountain beside the dance floor.  We hope that everyone will come to check things out and then dance with us.  
 Any mainstream dancers working towards an ambassador’s badge are welcome to come to one of our dances and ask for a mainstream tip.  Our caller will be glad to accommodate you.  
 It’s not too early to start accumulating food for our annual Canned Food Dance December 19th
