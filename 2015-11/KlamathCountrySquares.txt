Another Potato Festival has come and gone.  We enjoyed the dances, workshops and the no host dinner as well. 

We appreciate the the calling and cueing talents of Larry Sprout, Sarge Glidewell, Ray Holmes and Dave Cooper.  Thank you to Dave and Patty for making the trip down to Klamath Falls. The parade was damp but fun anyway.  Chuck Simpkins did a great job of calling on the float and advertising for the KCs.  A big thank you to Chuck and Carla, and Phil Ramey for bringing over the “dancing trailer”.  Once we got Phil to stop gathering candy and ice cream, he did a good job of driving in the parade.

Additionally, we appreciate Doty DeGarmo serving as chair for the festival, and furnishing decorations, and decorating, and overseeing the experienced clothing sale, and handling admissions and 50/50 sales and paying our talent, and directing clean up and you get the idea!!!!  Kudos to President Denny for keeping things running smoothly by helping out all around as well.   Thank you to Dorothy Herndon for the nice punch, and to Afton taking care of our signage, with help from Ron Johnson.  We are grateful to our friends from near and far who came out to dance especially the Star Promenaders and Charlie Browns.  And as always, tip of the hat to everyone stayed to help with clean up.  Special thanks to Larry and Roxanne for pre and post hall floor cleaning.
