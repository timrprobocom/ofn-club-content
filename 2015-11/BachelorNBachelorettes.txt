Our new kitchen boss (Jerry Addington) threw me out of the kitchen.  With nothing to do, the Prez asked me to write the column this month.  I do have to say it is interesting being replaced by the first club in town to hire PAID kitchen help.  Imagine, a person with *my* delectable cooking reputation being replaced by PAID help.  Humph!

November is going to be a great month.  Our featured caller of the month (Nov 11th) will be Rick Hampton from Visalia, California.  Join us to hear an out of the area caller that doesnâ€™t come up here all that often.

Our holiday season will start Nov 25th with our gift card raffle.  Oh, you may hear around town that itâ€™s a turkey raffle, but donâ€™t you believe it!  I am a truthful person and itâ€™s really just a gift card raffle!  Sorry, theyâ€™ll be no frozen turkey to hold against your chest on your way home, nor me to prepare it for you when you get home.  Have our reverend raffle seller bless your ticket especially!

Join me and my lovely dance partner, Flory Flounce, dancing any Wednesday night at our club.  If you buy enough raffle, she might just give you a dance â€&ldquo; or a flounce.
