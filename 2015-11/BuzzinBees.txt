Happy fall to you all from the Buzzin Bees. The season is off to a start with our first dance being bittersweet . It was a farewell to our long time caller Bill Lundin. It was a fun dance. We had our first dance with our new caller, K.C. Curtis and who knew, he plays a mean harmonica! It should be a great year.  We have a "Welcome K.C. and Linda" dance planned for 10/17/15. Come and enjoy our new caller. 

Last year we had a theme dance called "Raining cats and dogs". We took in donations of pet foods and other pet related items. We donated what we took in to the Southwest WA Humane Society. They were so pleased with the donations that we decided to repeat the theme so on 11/21 come wearing any dog or cat gear or rain gear and bring a donation for the Humane Society and enjoy our  new caller K.C and our favorite cuer, Debbie Combs. See you in a square.
