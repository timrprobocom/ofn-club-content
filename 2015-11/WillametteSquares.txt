Willamette Squares held its Oktoberfest dance with an abundant harvest of dancers in the spirit of Oktoberfest and many of the musical numbers took on the flavor of a polka beat. Refreshments consisted of traditional German food. 

Willamette Squares completed a series of three demo dances at the Salem Saturday Market. They were lots of fun and drew a crowd of attentive observers. Hopefully among those who saw us there will be potential dancers who would like to join us Sunday evenings for square dance lessons.

Our beginning square dance lessons began Sunday, September 27. We encourage people to come give square dancing a try and we can always use angels who get in a good review when they participate. 

At the recent Mid-Willamette Area meeting on September 21, our own Georgette Hagerman was installed into the office of President in a ceremony lead by John Templin.  Congratulations! Jodee Howard
