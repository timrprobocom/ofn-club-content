​The RedRocks had great attendance for the Cancer Survivor Dance Oct. 2nd. Larry Sprout was our caller and Dave Cooper was our cuer. The quilt raffle was ​​
won by Tom Klug. ​The quilt was made by Cathy Shores and Brenda Thompson. ​
The theme for the night was pink!

Thank you to everyone who donated their time and supplies for the dance that benefited the Sara Fisher Cancer foundation.
