Saints-n-Aints, along with Sets-in-Order, danced in the Fun Festival parade in September. As usual, we had a great time!

Our class started the second Sunday in September. We do not have many students but we are going to try and keep it going if we can.  

Hope everyone has a wonderful Thanksgiving!
