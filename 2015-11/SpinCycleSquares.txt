We've got an Advanced class going Sunday nights at 5:30 along with Mainstream and Plus.  Our caller, Tim Matteson, is flexible and actually can please everyone!  We are so blessed.

    We look forward to November 21, third Saturday,  when national caller, Kris Jensen, will be here to call for us.  Advanced is from 3:00 - 4:30, potluck at 4:30 and Mainstream and Plus from 5:30 - 8:00.  Spin Cycle Squares is famous for potlucks.  We'll also have a Silent Auction.  We are all encouraged to bring wonderful items for the silent auction.  This will all happen in Hall B (park behind the building) at the Emerald Dance Center / 2095 Yolanda / Springfield, OR, 97477.  This is a Saturday so we will not dance the following day, November 22. 

    Some of our members did the incredible corn maze at Lone Pine Farm recently and had a blast!  This corn maze is huge and laid out with the help of computers and GPS. 

    Please join us almost any Sunday evening at 5:30 at the Emerald Dance Center.  We usually dance in Hall A and are enjoying the new speakers.
 
Happy dancing,
Christina Corelli
