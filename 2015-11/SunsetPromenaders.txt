Sunset Promenaders were very active in September; on the 4th we had a visitation to the Toe Dragger’s Anniversary Dance, on the 10th-13th we had a Club Campout at the Devils Lake RV Resort in Lincoln City with 43 guests and club members, on the 18th Tri Squares visitation at their anniversary, and on the 28th celebrated George Clarks retirement at the Eager Beavers dance.
 At the campout the club and guests played games, did jigsaw puzzles, had a scavenger hunt, ate at Sambos on Friday night, and Saturday night we square and round danced after  a big taco bar dinner.
 At our November 7th dance the Promenaders will be asking for donations of food for Food Bank.  Our November 21st dance theme is “Giving Thanks” asking for more non-perishable food donations for our food drive.
 Thursdays of November 5th and 19th are the Promenaders Plus Dances.
