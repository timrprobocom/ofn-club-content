We still have not returned to dancing after quitting once again after our July dance.  It is still difficult to say when that might happen.  Please call our club coordinator Fred Beisse or look at our website cas-sd.yolosite.com to check if you are interested in being put on the email list he keeps to let us know or get input from the members.

Don't give up hope.  It'll happen.
