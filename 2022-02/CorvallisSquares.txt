The Corvallis Squares were able to hold a few dances last fall, and it was great to get back to dancing. We are looking forward to our Birthday Dance on the fourth Saturday in February, celebrating our 63rd birthday! We are also planning once again to hold a coast retreat, March 11 and 12, when we will be dancing at Gleneden Beach both Friday and Saturday nights. The past two years we have been unable to hold it and hope that all works out this time to be able to enjoy a weekend together!Â 

We have missed seeing many of our square dance friends and wish you good health in this New Year.
