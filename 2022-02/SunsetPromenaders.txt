 Sunset Promenaders are holding our own.  Still dancing 1st and 3rd Saturdays Mainstream.  Our Promenaders Plus are dancing the 1st, 3rd and 5th Thursday of the month.  We are having lessons starting on Sunday January 16th at 4pm at our hall.  Mike and Julie Stout will be teaching the class.
 Tami Helms is still having a workshop on Sundays starting at 2.30pm at our hall.  We are still requiring masks and vaccination to participate in our dances and classes.
 Our mainstream dances have been averaging about 3 squares.  Some of our Plus dances we have had up to 4 squares so we are happy with that.
 Hope to see you soon...
