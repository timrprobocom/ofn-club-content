IF you attended C & P’s December 17th Dance with Ian Craig and Julia Buchheit (Caller and Cuer), thank you for making it ‘two!’  Two squares seems to be the ‘norm,’ for C&P since returning to square dance (after COVID).  Although I must say our Caller, Scott Zinser, has been having some fun with such small groups.  On January 7th, Chaps first dance in the 2022 New Year, Scott shook the cobwebs off  a ‘sleeping’ move and reviewed ‘Up the Escalator' - watching the dance looked like a spider’s web being formed!   

Some of  us Chaps have been angeling the Silver City Squares MS students, in Silverton, on Tuesday nights.  They flourish their moves with such enthusiasm - well, it makes me smile.  They hang around, after lessons, and line dance to two or three, or four songs.  These are the same dancers that will go to the Pacific NW Teen Festival in May and compete as a Club… it is so fun to see square dancing grow! 

Please continue to join Chaps and Petticoats at our first and third FRIDAY dances.  February 4th we dance to Scott Z. and Julie Stiers, care to make it three squares?  February 18 is our FLINTSTONE dance, yes it is a costume (if you prefer) dance and both Darrell Kalmbach and Tami Helms will try to win the prizes - it will keep you entertained…join us!

Don’t forget your Valentine on FEB 14th! 

Hugs,
Betty Chipps
