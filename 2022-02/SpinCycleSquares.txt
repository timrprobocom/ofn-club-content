We meet from 4 - 6 on Sundays to visit while socially distanced.  We have all had our vaccinations and boosters and may be dancing soon.  At least, we hope so.  The number of new cases is still staggering, but we are hopeful to dance once again. 
 
Please call our president, David LaJoie to make sure we are meeting.  You are cordially invited to visit.  Please know we are accepting visitors and dancers who are fully vaccinated.  541-520-7311 
 
Thank you and hope to see you!
