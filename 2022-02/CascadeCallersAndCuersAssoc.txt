Our next scheduled dance is April 30, 2022 at the hall in Springfield.  We are being optimistic that COVID issues will be low enough for us to have a dance and all will be safe. 
 
After that, our next scheduled Fifth Saturday dance will be July 30, 2022.
 
We want to thank all of our dancers, callers and cuers for being patient and for staying healthy and safe.  It does, indeed, take a village.
 
Thank you one and all!
Christina Corelli
