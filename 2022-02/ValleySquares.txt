  Greetings from VS Members.  Hope you are keeping warm.  Our February 19th dance is full of love for square dancing and square dancers.  We started our classes in January on Tuesday's.  (Since classes start after this report, I'll report more in the March report.)  
 We lost a loved member of VS on December 24.  Jeff Tefelske had a massive heart attack.  We keep his wife Sharon in our prayers.  They moved to Wisconsin a couple of years ago, but have been a part of our club and our hearts.  
 Take care and dance, dance, dance,
  Carolene Siebert
