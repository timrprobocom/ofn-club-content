  Our club skipped the January Zoom board meeting since we are not holding dances yet and had no new business.  Our visitations chairman, Ursula, has been setting up visitations for us to other clubs, but the Omicron variant is very high and our members are reluctant to attend.  We still hold monthly chat meetings for members over Zoom.  Looking forward to spring!
