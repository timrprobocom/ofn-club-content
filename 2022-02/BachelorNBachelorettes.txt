     We're having our Groundhog Day Dance (the only groundhog day dance in the state), in conjunction with our class graduation, on Feb 2nd.  Come bring your class students and have a great time.  It's such a special dance that we are also giving away groundhog dangles for the evening!  Jim Hattrick will be calling, along with our club cuer Tami Helms.

     Don't forget our new schedule: 1st, 3rd, and 5th Wednesdays of each month.
