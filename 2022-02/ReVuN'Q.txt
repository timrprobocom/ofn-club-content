Happy New Year to all our friends and fellow dancers. 

We had a quiet December due to lessons with not a full house of dancers. Various absences for a multitude of reasons. We shut down for the December 30 lessons due to weather.

We will complete the early class of Rumba lessons about mid-January and contemplate what is next. Looking for new students to begin with, and if not enough sign up, the early class will not continue. We will go back to our regular hours of 7-9 p.m. with a continuation of Waltz 3 & 4 in the middle somewhere. There are still many moves to manage and learn to do all over again.
	
Randy’s contract has been extended so we are good for another few months. Come and dance with us and enjoy the friends there.
	
We have applied for and received the reservation for New Year’s Eve 2022. So we have a year to plan for a good evening of fun and companionship.
