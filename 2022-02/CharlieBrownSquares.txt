Our 1st SSD program is in the books, with 1 graduated, and happy, dancer. Our next session of SSD starts on Tuesday, January 18th. We hope to have more new dancers join in the fun. We also had a successful SSD dance on January 7th, and everyone had a great time. We will be doing SSD dances 1x month, typically on 2nd Fridays; or as the schedule allows. Our Amateur nite on the 15th was a lot of fun, with several callers taking the stage! Everyone did a great job!

Our February dances are on the 1st & 3rd Saturdays of the month (5th/19th) with Chuck Simpkins and Rikki Lobato calling & cueing both dances. February 11th will be our SSD dance, this is a Friday and Chuck Simpkins is calling.

We are very excited about our upcoming Boatnik Festival; and have hopes that it will happen after having to cancel the last 2 Festivals. Boatnik Festival is Memorial Day weekend with dancing starting Friday nite and going thru Sunday afternoon. We also do a Jet Boat trip on Memorial Day Monday. Always a wonderful time!!!  This year's talent will be Eric Henerlau & Dan (Alison) Drumheller - don't miss it!!!

We hope everyone has a wonderful time at MidWinter Festival, and see you on the floor!!
