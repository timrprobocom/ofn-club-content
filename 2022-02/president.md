And just like that, January is gone. Some clubs that were going to start dancing and having classes in January have now pushed those back to March or even April.  Other clubs I see are now trying to get lessons going. I really hope they can be successful. 

New Year’s Eve dances were canceled in the Portland/Vancouver area because of the weather when we got the snowfall in late December.  Another blow to our activity. Seems like the hits just keep on a’comin’.

As president I have not been able to get out and visit clubs like I wanted to just because so many clubs are not dancing.  So far, my year (well, the first 4 months), has been kind of quiet. We will have to see how 2022 pans out going forward. 

Hope to see you in a square soon and…..

Let’s Get Back to Dancing
