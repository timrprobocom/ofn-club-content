Not much to report this month. We graduated 13 students from our Mainstream class on January 25 and several of them joined us at Mid-Winter Festival.

Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival has been cancelled again for 2022 BUT Silver City Squares and Jacks & Jills will be doing a simplified club vs. club competition instead. Details are being worked out. Watch for more information.

Since we are going to be having a type of competition and it will be at our home hall, we are fundraising to help cover food expenses for the entire group that will be in attendance. We will have our raffle tickets for sale at Mid-Winter. These are $1.00 each or six for $5.00. There are three $100.00 cash prizes.
