 The Council did not have a meeting in December, usually held on the 4th Monday, as it was so close to the holiday season.
 Last year, because of Covid  concerns, the annual TVC Presidents Meeting was not held.  Since the TVC Recognition award is presented at that meeting, none was awarded.  The award for last year, 2020,  will be presented at this years MidWinter Festival.  This has been a tradition for 28 years and it is hoped that there will be many TVC club members participating at the award ceremony during the MidWinter Festival.
 The next Council event will be our annual TVC Presidents Meeting to honor current and past club Presidents.  Attendees will be required to abide by the current Oregon State mask mandate.  One must wear a mask but will not need to be vaccinated.  It will be held in the main dance hall at the IOOF Hall, 267 East Main Street, Hillsboro, OR 97123 on January 31st.  We feel that the spacing between attendees will be more easily done in the dance hall rather than the dining area.  The evening will begin with a meeting at 7:00.  All TVC club Presidents & members are invited to join us. The TVC wishes to thank all the presidents of the TVC Clubs for volunteering their time and efforts into this activity we all love.  Also at this meeting the presentation of the Tualatin Valley Council “2021 Recognition Award” for outstanding service and special contribution to the square dance community within the TVC geographical area.
