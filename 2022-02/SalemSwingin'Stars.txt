Although we had to reschedule our New Year's Eve Dance due to the frigid weather and snow, we had a great turnout for our New Year's Dance on January 7. Four squares on the floor beginning with Plus and continuing through the evening.  We took a break at 9:00 p.m. and raised our glasses to toast the New Year. Randy Dibble kept us hopping in our squares and Randy Lewis cued a great set of Rounds. Country Cut-Ups brought a square and took back their banner. Thank you all for joining us. We got dressed up and had FUN!

We will continue with our Regular schedule of first, third and fifth Friday dances for 2022.February 4 will be our Annual Wear Red Dance in honor of Heart Disease in Women.

Hope to see you in a square.
