We had a good December with two dances and a successful silent auction. We raised over 30 cans of decaf coffee and $284 from the silent auction for our designated charity, Windsor House. Roger and Linda Bergerson delivered the goods, with our gratitude.
	
Our January 1 dance was cancelled due to the Fairgrounds being rented for another event. We danced on January 8 for our only dance for the month.
	
Lessons are continuing at the Salem Square Dance Center. They are close to completion and we will continue with workshops into early February. 

We are looking forward to celebrating our 62nd birthday in March. More information to come later.
