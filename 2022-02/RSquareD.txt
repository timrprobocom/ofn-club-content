 R Square D has two dances scheduled in February.  Our Valentine Dance is Friday, February 11th with Craig Abercrombie calling and Susan Healea cueing.  We dance again on Saturday, February 26th (“Rockin’ to the 50s and 60s”) with guest caller Mark Wheeler and cueing by Susan Healea. Put on your poodle skirts, saddle shoes, “cat eye” glasses, and dance to popular music from this era! 
 Our dances start at 7:00 PM with plus dancing and intermediate rounds, then mainstream tips and rounds from 8:00 to 9:30.  We dance at Kelso Senior Center, 108 NW 8th Ave, Kelso, WA.  We do not require proof of vaccination but face masks are required (face shields are not allowed in place of masks in WA State).
 Lessons that began in January will continue on Wednesday evenings with plus 6:30 – 7:30 and beginning class 7:30 – 9:00.
