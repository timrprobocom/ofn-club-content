 Our turnout for the Christmas Day Dance on December 20th was good.  There was a number of beautiful Christmas outfits making the hall look festive.  We took pictures by the Christmas tree, and emailed them out.  We have been averaging three squares of dancers each Monday.  Sending out a big THANK YOU to our visitors and members that have been supporting our club.  However we did cancel our last dance of the year due to the snow.  There were concerns about our parking area being slippery.
 Have you made your resolutions for the new year?  Was one of them to take Plus Lessons?  Please help spread the word that Plus Lessons are on our schedule starting Monday February 14th 12:00 to 1:15 pm.  Come to learn or to refresh.  Our regular Plus dance will be from 1:15 to 3:00 pm following the class.
 We continue to require face masks or shields, along with proof of vaccination, to ensure the safety of our members and guests at both lessons and our dances.  Be well be safe.  Please check for up to date information at www.EagerBeavers.info
 Sharing a Quote we can all relate to from our club Treasurer Mike Duyck:
"The friendships made while dancing are the gold to our lives.  I think we are rich in the friends we have and those to come.  I have a bad time remembering names but there are seldom dances where I can’t fine several people that already know or that I can’t get to know.  I don’t know too much about them but they are also dancers because they want to be and they have made an effort to be here to have fun and also meet people."
