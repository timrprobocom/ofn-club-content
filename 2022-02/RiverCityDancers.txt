The New Year has begun. We greeted it with enthusiasm and hope for a better year to come.

We continue to dance twice a month . Our dances are on the second and third Saturday. The dances now begin at 7 with plus and pre rounds  and then 7:30- 9:30 mainstream and rounds.

Lessons for new and returning dancers and youths 12 and older began January 9 with the first lesson free. They continue each Sunday from 5PM to 7PM . The cost is $6 per lesson. . 

We wish you all a happy new year and look forward to a great year of dancing.
