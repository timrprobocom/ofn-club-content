We held a dance on Saturday Dec.18 which included a pre-dinner potluck.  The potluck was well attended considering how few people are dancing these days.  George Hermann called and Patty Hermann cued as Christina Corelli came down ill at the last minute.  She is doing fine.  We enjoyed the dancing very much as we love George and Patty.  We hope to see them back with us soon.

In February on the 26th, the normal 4th Friday for our dances, Jim Hattrick will call our birthday dance.  That should be a wonderful event for everyone who wants to dance and misses seeing all their square dancing friends on a regular basis.  Please pass the word so more people might come and join us on the dance floor.  We start with 15 minutes of pre-rounds at 7:30, a plus tip at 7:45 and then mainstream with every third tip plus thereafter.  We do not take a break and end the dance at 10PM.

We've been dancing since May 2021 and there have been no reports of anyone contracting COVID at one of our dances.  Luck?  Or the conscientious observance of mask-wearing, hand sanitizing and keeping a respectable distance when not in a square.  Moreover our hall is very large and airy. 

Keep on dancing,
