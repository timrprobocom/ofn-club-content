The Single Trees Sweetheart of a 52nd birthday dance on February 12th was really terrific, thanks to the busload of Vancouver Happy Hoppers. (Their president, Danny Williamson, did a great job organizing the trip.) We also had visitors from the Sweet Home Squarenaders, the Roseburg Buckaroos, and many from our area clubs as well - definitely too many to name. The potluck turned out to be a big highlight before the dance as we pledged to feed our guests from Vancouver. Our club came through with lots of food, and many others turned up with food in hand to add to the party - the list was long. We had more than one hundred and thirty attendees with at least 12 squares on the floor! We hadn’t seen the hall that full for a very long time.

The Wild Cards did a fantastic job with the harmonizing and solos, and we loved K.C. Curtis who jazzed it up a bit on the harmonica. I knew we were in for a great round dance time when our cuer, Jackie Gale, started it off with “Heard it from the Grapevine.” Everyone had a very great time with the majority staying on the floor until the end. Those cleaning up finally got out of the hall a bit after 11:00 pm. But it was fun - it was worth it - and it deserves a big hurrah!
