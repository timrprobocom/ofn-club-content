Greetings from the Buzzin Bees.  April showers bring May flowers and our anniversary party. The Bees are celebrating 58 years as a club on April 16th and we will welcome guest caller Terry Halley as he joins K.C. Curtis, calling and Debbie Combs,cuing. We always have great "Bee"  theamed door prizes and look forward to welcoming our guests. Come, have a great time and cake.

The Bees have a new name to add to our pie eating winners plaque and the winner is... Hayley Carter. She did a great job eating and wearing that chocolate cream pie!

We started something new, for us, in March. We have always been a mainstream club but some of us felt the need for a challenge so we will start Plus lessons on dance nights. Lessons will be from 6:00 to 7:15. Pre-rounds will go from 7:30 to 8 and the dance starts at 8 p.m. with every third tip Plus once we know enough to do a plus tip. Do you need some plus tune up? Come join us.
