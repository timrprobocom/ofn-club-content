As winter tries to hold on and spring is trying to spring, the Columbia River Dancers are starting our second year.  We have scheduled the Hazel Dell Grange for the summer and are planning NOT to be dark.  We will continue to have dances every second and fourth Saturday.  There will be some opportunities for us to visit and get a few of our banners and shirts back as well.  On the 9th of April we will have Scott Zinser as our guest caller and on the 23rd Randy Dibble will keep us twirling.
 Many of the CRD's went to Springfield to dance the night away there on February 12th and help the Toe Draggers celebrate their anniversary.  They all came home sleepy, full of good potluck food and eager to go again.  Your reporter got sick and missed a great time.  Darn.
 Growth is good and we are holding our own.  We have seen a few younger dancers out and would like to encourage them.  I understand there is an effort to get a teen group going in the Portland area and we will assist any way we can.  We are known as a family club.  I always say the family that squares together has a lot of fun.
 Our beginner lessons start the first Tuesday of each month.  A Beginner Two class will be right after the beginner class.  Jim Hattrick taught a beginning waltz round dance the first Tuesday of March before square dance class.
 Lastly, if any clubs are finishing their beginning square dance classes, there may be an opportunity to dance at B-51 level on a Tuesday night in early May.  If there is interest in such an event, please let the Columbia River Dancers know and we will see if we can arrange something.
