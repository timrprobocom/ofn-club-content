The Milton-Freewater Muddy Frogs are eager for spring and enjoying getting back to our regular Sunday afternoon schedule.  Bill Reid continues to work with our mainstream class, while Neva Reid instructs the social ballroom class of about 20 people in the Night Club Two Step.  The third Sunday of April is the regular club dance from 3:00-5:00 p.m. with a potluck following.  We dance at the Community Building, 109 NE 5th in Milton-Freewater.  It would be great to see your smiling faces there!
