The Sunset Promenaders were very happy to have so many visitors at our February 6th dance; we had visitors from River City Dancers, Silver City Dancers, Toe Draggers, and others with a total of six squares.  We really do appreciate visitors coming to our dances; it makes it a lot of fun.
 Our Mainstream lessons are continuing, the students are doing well, and we have lots of good “angels’ help.  Thank you dancers for coming out and helping the students.  About half of our students went to a jamboree at the Valley Squares and had a good time with other students from the around the Portland area. 
 Starting on April 2nd our dance format will change to one hour of Plus with Intermediate Rounds starting at 7:00 until 8:00 and then Mainstream dance from 8:00 until 10:00 with Mike Stout calling and Ken Pratt cueing, except the 2nd Julie Stout will be cueing as Ken will be on vacation.  
 The Promenaders Plus Dances, featuring Darrell Kalmbach and Ken Pratt are held on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Thursdays and are continuing with a good turnout of dancers.  The dances, at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro, are from 7:00 until 9:30 with a break afterwards.
