The Ramblers March dance featured a Get Lucky! theme in honor of St. Patrickâ€™s Day. We were pleased to welcome visitors from Floor Dusters and Chaps and Petticoats. Luck ruled the evening as caller Kris Jensen from Albuquerque energized the dance floor with challenging, fast-paced tips and a varied musical selection. Kris does a fabulous job of identifying the level of dancers on the floor, so her dances are challenging but not to the point of breaking down squares. Kris usually calls for the Ramblers once or twice a yearâ€&rdquo;watch for her next appearance, and join us for a dance. You will not be disappointed!
 
In April, Gary Monday will be venturing down from Seattle to call for us on April 2. Gary is a rising star among national callersâ€&rdquo;known for his crisp and clear choreography and diverse music choices. Itâ€™s a real treat to be able to dance with him. Weâ€™ll be dancing from 7-9 p.m. at the Milwaukie Grange. Singles and couples are welcome.
 
For those like to plan ahead, mark your calendars for our annual three-day square dance extravaganza. This year, we will be dancing October 28-30 at the Multnomah Arts Center, 7688 SW Capitol Highway, Multnomah Village, Portland 97219. 
 
SYIAS!
