Spring has sprung for the Silver Stars.  We have had an upsurge in attendance at our dances since we moved to 4th Friday night dancing.  Darrell Kalmbach is keeping us on our toes and our minds spinning with his choreography and singing.  What a breath of fresh air.  Dorothy Lowder keeps us challenged and moving with her cueing.

April brings our "Surfin' USA" anniversary spectacular.  Get out your surfin' shorts, and splash down your surfboard for a fun evening celebrating with us.  Dancing starts with pre-rounds at 7 pm, plus at 7:30 and mainstream from 8 - 10 pm.    We are in the process of selecting officers for next yearâ€™s officers.   Come dance with us, bring a friend or two, and plan on a great time of dancing and fellowship. 

Hugs and yellow rocks to all,
Teresa Hill
