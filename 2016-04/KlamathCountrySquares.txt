The new dancers who have joined the Klamath Country Squares are learning and dancing every Thursday.  There were a couple of snow cancellations this
winter, but everyone was too pleased by the moisture to complain.

We are pleased to announce that Scott Zinser will be our featured caller for the Potato Festival in October. We are equally pleased that Christina Corelli has agreed to cue for the festival.  We will be announcing the dance and workshop schedules soon.
