We enjoy greeting the newer dancers who have been joining us in our squares, as well as our regulars and those who haven't been with us for a while.  
 On June 4th, former SOS (Singles on Saturday) members plan to gather at the Winona Grange about 6:00 p.m. for an hour of reunion.  Those who still dance will likely stay for our dance.  Since Randy Dibble will be elsewhere that night, Darrell Kalmbach will fill in for him.  
 That will lead into our summer special events dances, our Red, White, and Blue dance July 2nd, our Root Beer Float Dance August 6th, and our Watermelon Dance September 17th.  If you ever want to check if there has been a last minute change, go to our website for the latest news.
