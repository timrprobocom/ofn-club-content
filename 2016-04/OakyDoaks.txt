 "The Oaky Doaks are trying something new this month. Join us on Saturday, April 2 and add a dangle to your jangle to commemorate our special April Fool's Fun Dance.  Caller MC Mike Halley will welcome callers from the floor for whacky variations on the square dance theme - like SqRounds, Blindfolded, Ghost Dancing, and Rubber Chickens.  All singing calls.

Our mainstream class is going extremely well. We have great students and the angels are keeping the fun level up while helping them learn.  Weâ€™ll introduce them to the larger square dance community at a Beginnersâ€™ Jamboree/Dance Attire Resale on Thursday, April 14th from 7:30 â€&ldquo; 9:30pm at the Oak Grove Community Hall.  Students and angels from other clubs are welcome!

We dance the first and third Saturday evenings of the month: Phase III waltz lesson 7:00 - 7:30, Intermediate Rounds 7:30 - 8:00, Squares beginning at 8:00."
