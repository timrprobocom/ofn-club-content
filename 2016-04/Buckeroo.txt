February was a busy month for the Buckeroos! We started out the month with our Sweetheart dance called by Chuck Simpkins. We had a nice turnout and everyone enjoyed the fun evening. The decorations were beautiful and the evening reminded us all to treasure good friends.

Mid-month we had a visitation to the Single Trees in Springfield. We enjoyed dancing to the Wild Cards and getting to visit with the busload of visitors that drove down from Portland for the dance. It was so much fun to see the floor filled with dancers having a good time!

Roger Putzler called our second dance of the month. Since February was National Heart Health month, we celebrated by dancing the night away. We all enjoyed being able to exercise and still have a great time.

At the end of the month, we had 26 dancers head down to Medford for the Caller/Cuer Jamboree. It was held at the Star Promenaders Dance Hall and everyone had a super time. In fact, 19 of our 26 dancers had the opportunity to earn their purple heart dangle!

Happy dancing!
