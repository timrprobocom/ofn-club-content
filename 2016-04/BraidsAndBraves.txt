We had a fun month in February. Our new dancers graduated and joined the club. Graduation was held at our regular dance. Our dance was themed “Famous Couples”. Each dancer received a name tag for a member of a famous couple. Then we found our famous partner and danced a tip with whoever was the other half of that couple! Very cute idea! 
     Our caller, Leonard Snodgrass, is teaching a Plus Brush-Up class on Thursday nights at the Yamhill Valley Heritage Center from 6:30-8 pm. We sometimes have two squares. 
     We also visited the Hoedowners in Aloha for their 66th Anniversary, preceded by a delicious chicken dinner. 16 dancers went from our club - more than half of our club!  What a fun evening!  Visiting other clubs is great fun and we hope you'll come visit us. Carmen Rost
