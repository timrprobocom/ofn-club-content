Itâ€™s getting to be spring.  I love spring!  Itâ€™s the season when young menâ€™s hearts turn to â€&ldquo; well whatever they turn to.

And I just love to ask Lotta and Flory for dances.  Theyâ€™re so polite (like the rest of our club) theyâ€™d never turn me down for a dance.  And, frankly, itâ€™s the only time I can touch them without them having me arrested!

Itâ€™s our 51st anniversary this year, and weâ€™ll celebrate April 13, with our usual caller for our anniversary dance, DAN NORDBY from Gilbert, Arizona.  It will also be a great time to apply for club membership, to support all our great activities for the year.  Membership only $12 a year.

April 27 will be our annual dance with internationally renowned MIKE SIKORSKY from Mesa, Arizona.  Be very sure you come early, so that parking attendant Bruce Bruiser doesnâ€™t assign you a parking place in the back 40!  If you think we sound tough, weâ€™re really a bunch of pussy cats.

Tami Helms will be cueing all our dances this month.
