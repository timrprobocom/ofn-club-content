Raise your umbrellas, splash through those puddles in your galoshes, and change into your dancing shoes for our April Showers Dance April 2nd.  Two weeks later, drive your Italian sports cars to our Italian Theme Dance April 16th.  Some tasty Italian dishes will await you at our Open Break.
 We tried something new at our Valley Squares 3rd Saturday Winter Wonderland Dance in February.  Instead of dancing Plus from 7-8, we had a student level dance.  Tips got progressively more sophisticated, and the evening ended with an hour of Plus.  Even though our students were only in their 5th week of lessons, they did themselves proud.  We were joined by students and new dancers from Hoedowners, Sunset Promenaders, Rosetown Ramblers, and Tualatin Timbers, making a total of 9 squares.  Everyone had a marvelous time, and the energy was fantastic.  Students and new dancers want to dance as soon and as often as possible, so Valley Squares are considering whether to add this opportunity to our schedule on a regular basis.  We encourage other clubs to try something similar and let us know what you learn and think.  Please let your students and new dancers know about any opportunity to dance and thus strengthen their skills and build a stronger network of square dance fans throughout Oregon.
 Our Soup-er Bowl Dance had so many tasty soups - about 8 different varieties to warm tummies on a dark and rainy winter evening.  Joy Choy created a football field for the buffet table, and fun football themed decorations put people into a rah-rah mood.
 Thanks so much to everyone who has supported our students by helping out at lessons and dancing with us on the 1st & 3rd Saturdays.  To steal from Southwest Airlines, we realize there are many choices on these Saturdays.  Thanks for choosing Valley Squares.
