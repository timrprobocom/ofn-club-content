Willamette Squares held its Valentine square and round dance, including plus dancing at the Salem Square Dance Center on the evening of February 27. We danced the night away with Sandy Harris calling and Sandy Pinion cueing, celebrating all that February holds. Of course, what would a valentine themed dance be without chocolate which was available along with other delicious foods! A lucky few were the recipients of chocolate hearts. 
     Our Sunday round dance classes continue and prove to be very popular. The class is taught by Ralph Lambert and assisted by Marilyn Schmit. 
     For the month of March we invite you all to our next regular dance on March 26 titled Eggstravaganza. There will be an Easter egg hunt for all in attendance! Our April dance will consist of our annual Maypole dance.
     It has been announced that Summer Festival 2017 will be held in Salem. Our club is encouraged to volunteer to help other MWA clubs with that festival.
     The annual summer picnic is currently in the planning stages. We hope to be able to organize one for the upcoming summer. In the meantime, enjoy dancing!
