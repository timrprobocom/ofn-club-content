Beachcomberâ€™s rhumba and beginning square dance class continues this month with a target graduation date of May 8. Turnout has been good with several people from other clubs in the area helping out as angels and some students. Our dances have been well attended and our next dance will be April 23 with Lennie Ludiker calling and Cathy Houston cueing.
