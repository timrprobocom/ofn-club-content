<h3>Publicity Column</h3>
<p>
Thank you to the 85 people who have joined the new Federation Facebook
page.  If you haven’t had a chance to check out the new Federation
Facebook page, from your Facebook home page, type in the search field,
“Oregon Federation of Square and Round Dance Clubs”.  Click on the
“Join” group button so that you can explore and post your club’s
square dancing flyers and information to this page.  This page has
not been created to replace the OFN, but to work with it to help spread
information and reminders about our dances and special activities.  In an
attempt to have information from all of the clubs and councils, I have
joined many of the club and council Facebook pages so I can forward posts
to the new Federation from your pages. Now, I need your help spreading
the word! If your club or council has a FB page that I have not joined,
please send me its name so that I can help you keep the Federation's page
up to date with your dancing information. Please encourage all of your
dancing friends to join the Federation page too. If you have information
on the National Convention, festivals, or dances that are in another
state that you think Oregon dancers would be interested in attending,
please feel free to post this information, too.
