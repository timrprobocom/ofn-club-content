Many thanks to all the Plus dancers who've come to support the first two Swinging Mountaineers​ ​dance/workshop weekends.  We've had a great time dancing and learning with more to come.  The Saturday workshops are designed to help Plus dancers understand the definitions of Plus and Mainstream calls inside and out and every which way so that squares keep moving and smiling especially when callers get creative. 

These Saturday morning workshops aren't sissy stuff, and we know it's hard to roll out of bed after an all-out fun night of Friday night dancing. But, set your alarm clock and let our fresh coffee and doughnuts be your gateway to the dance floor.You might be sleepy, but you won't be bored.

Since the original information was distributed we've had a few changes, and the flyer below reflects our current lineup.  Richard Lane is calling our next dance, and Jim Steele will be our master instructor on Saturday. Randy Dibble has joined the lineup at the end of May and will do an A workshop in the afternoon in addition to his morning Plus workshop. Mark your calendars and invite your friends from around the state.
