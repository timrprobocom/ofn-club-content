Our birthday dance in February was well attended. Thank you to everyone who came out to help us celebrate. 
     We are trying to get out to visit other clubs as much as we can. Our visit to the Valley River Dancers on February 26 brought a wonderful donation for our youth dancers who are going to Canada for competition. Our youth are practicing hard and learning some new styling to add to our display dancing
