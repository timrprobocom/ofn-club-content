The Valley River Dancers mainstream lessons and A workshops are going gangbusters on Tuesday evenings, but will have a short hiatus later this month while the Dibble Cruisers take off for Hawaii. And, speaking of taking off, our club is proud to have made a generous donation to help the kids take off for the competition in Canada. We challenge other clubs to do the same.
     Mark your calendars now for our annual Dance Under the Stars, Friday, July 22, in Newberg.
