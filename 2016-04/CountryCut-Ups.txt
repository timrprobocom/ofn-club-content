We are excited to be the first club to try a collaborative dance with the Portland Area Council. Sunday April 3rd from 1:00 to 4:00 PM, there will be a B-51 level dance at the Boring Barn, co-hosted by PAC and the Country Cut-Ups. Scott Zinser will be calling and Molly Combs will be cueing. We hope to see many of the new students as well as lots of experienced dancers there to support this effort. We really need to support these basic level dances to promote the future of square dancing. Without a place to start dancing, without having to know it all, new dancers can quickly feel excluded. Come on out and have fun! 
 
Speaking of coming out to the Barn, donâ€™t forget the annual Barn Sale, April 8th and 9th. There is always a wide selection of unique items and gently used things. Come and support one of our major fund raisers of the year. For club members, bring in donations up until April 5th, and join us that morning to help set up.

Because of the Barn Sale, our mainstream class will not meet on Thursday, April 7th.  It is great to see eager students learning the calls and having fun. Scott Zinser is a great teacher and makes sure everyone has a chance to learn the calls. Angel support is always welcome and needed.
 
Looking back a little, our club has been out actively visiting other clubs. On 2/19/16, we visited the Silver Stars in Vancouver, WA at their new time slot on fourth Fridays. We had a full square and brought home a banner, with hopes they will come out the Barn to snag it back. Everyone enjoyed the calling of Darrell Kalmbach.
