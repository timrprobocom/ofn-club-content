I guess we need to be thankful for our wet and windy winter, with hopes Spring is just around the corner.  We have kept ourselves busy, dancing through March.  We were given a pot of gold, with the friendships of our new club members, from mainstream lessons.  
 Our round dance lessons have been going smoothly and we worked hard learning the 2 step and now have moved on to the waltz.  Through April, feel free to stop by and join us as a new round dancer or brush up dancer.  Our lessons are on Sunday afternoons at the Kinton Grange starting at 2 P.M.
 Our Rub a Dub Ducky dance was a blast.  We honored Tom Gray with his collection of ducks of all sizes, with decorations and costumes.  He is quite a collector.  Tom always brings his largest duck (fits in the bed of his pickup to our campout in August and uses it as a night light for the campers).  
 Our April 1st dance will be held at the Odd Fellow Hall in Hillsboro, because our grange is busy with their annual bazaar.  It’s a great one to stop by at the Kinton Grange, first weekend of April and see if you might find a gift for yourself or a friend.  April is our donation month to bring animal blankets, toys and pet food to the dances.  All items will be donated to the Oregon Humane Society.  April 15th dance has the title of Raining Cats and Dogs so we will remember to help out our 4 footed friends.  We’ll be back to our own grange for this dance.
 We are looking forward to our Mystery Trip coming up soon.  It always brings a fun surprise to all that attend.
 The Toes wanted to send good well wishes to Bill Hults for a quick recovery after his surgery.  Peggy and Bill are missed on the dance floor.  Two of our favorites.  See you in a square.
