Our round dance class is doing well with Donna Hiserote teaching. We have quite a few new dances and others who are there for the brush up.

Aprll 16th will be our 38th Birthday Dance so if you are in the area drop in and join us!

Our 5th Saturday Area Dance will be held April 30 at Beachcomberâ€™s in Port Orford.  It will be a jamboree dance with our new area callers and will be an afternoon dance for beginners from 3-6 pm.  So even if you are not a beginner come join us for an afternoon of fun and friendship!
