Hello, from IWW. On March 5, we had a fun dance with lots of visitors and look forward to March 12 for our 56th Birthday dance. You can go to the IWW web site and see pictures. 
     We invite all dancers to come and visit with IWW. Mark your calendars for May 7, 2016. This will be IWWâ€™s Cinco de Mayo dance. Come enjoy the fun and great Mexican food. It is the normal finger food table but with a Mexican theme. It should be great fun, so come join us
