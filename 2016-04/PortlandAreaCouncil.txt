Our biggest news flash, in a long time, is the potential sale of the Clark County Square Dance Center.  There are square and round clubs across the nation that would sell their clubâ€™s soul in order to have such a fine dance facility.

As of OFN press time, the sale is shrouded in a north/south boundary dispute, plus the fact that the county intends to put a road through the south end of the property.  But these things will eventually be settled.

The main question is if the square dance community will let this fine facility slip out of its hands, like the Portland Square Dance Center did years ago.  It is true that few dances are held at the CCSDC anymore, but the facilities are lauded for its floor, which is on springs and was specifically designed for dancing.

How can you help?  Sincerely, the best way is to contact the CCSDC on your willingness to purchase shares that current members may be willing to sell.  And then become a member of its board, voting to keep the Center in reserve for the dance community.  Whatever happens will be a new chapter for the Vancouver/Portland square dance community.
