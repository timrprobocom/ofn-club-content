We had our 66th Birthday Party Dance in March.  Dancers from the different clubs in our area attended.  There was a really cute cake with square dancers on it and ice cream and other goodies.  66 years ago we started dancing in Sadie Bertlesen's kitchen in the Danebo area of Eugene.  Ivan Midlam was the caller.  There was no cuer as the round dancers learned the Rounds of the Month from the caller.  Dancers bought their own records and memorized the dances.  Now our caller is Roger Putzler and cuer is Christina Corelli.  Shirley McCornack cued for many years when we were still at Prairie Hall.  Sharon Greenman also cued for Danebo Circle 8.  Dale Hornberger, Brent Anderson, Richard Finch and most recently, Kirby Goode, called.  66 years is a long time!  Happy Birthday!
 
Mimi Mills, lifetime member of Danebo Circle 8, is still atr Avamere Rehab Center on Chambers Street in Eugene.  She's bored and company is encouraged and very welcome.  She's better which is a good sign.  Her family takes her to church and out to eat once in a while.  We pray for Mimi's healing and for her husband, Red, who spent a short time in the hospital due to breathing problems but is home no.  Their daughter, Leann, is a godsend.
 
We've discovered that Don Anderson, former member of Danebo Circle 8, is at a different rehabilitation center following additional surgery on his foot.  He'll be there for a while. We pray that Mimi and Don heal quickly and are both on their feet soon.
 
Keep on dancin'
