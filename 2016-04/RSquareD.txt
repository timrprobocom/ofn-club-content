R Square D danced on February 12th, celebrating Valentine's Day.  The floor was a sea of red as many were dressing for the occasion with red shirts and skirts.  This dance was attended by members of Cougar Squares, Ruff & Ruffles, and Tillamook Wave Steppers.  Sandy Sims' sister from Connecticut visited us for the evening.  She is a non square dancer, but enjoyed the evening watching the dancers and chatting with one and all.  Dancing in the rain was the theme for our February 27th dance.  Umbrellas were abundant, one square tried to dance holding umbrellas.  Prior to the dance the members enjoyed a pancake feed.  Craig Abercrombie called and Lonnie Sycks cued for both of these dances.
 On April 8th R Square D will be celebrating their 63rd Anniversary.  Craig Abercrombie will be calling and Lonnie Sycks will be cueing.  Come help us celebrate our anniversary!  On the 23rd Scott Koons will be calling and Lonnie Sycks will be cueing for our 50's and 60's dance. Scott is a great caller and Elvis impersonator.  This is a dance that you won't want to miss.
 Here's hoping April showers bring May flowers.
