The club continues to add songs to our music list that we know how to dance. We are getting more dancing in each week and less teaching other than a pesky step or two that prevents us from doing the entire song.
     We have a sign-up sheet for people to run for office and hope that some of the members will step forward and get involved. We are also contemplating increasing the door fee and the membership dues. Some Thursdays, we donâ€™t make enough to cover expenses and that is not good. Come and join us for dancing and friendship.
