Kris Jensen, national caller from Albuquerque, was here in early March.  It's always a treat to have Kris call for us.  Tim Matteson, our caller, get a chance to dance too. Kris's brother, Kurt and his wife, Lorna, are members of Spin Cycle Squares.
 
Spin Cycle Squares is sponsoring Dan Nordbye, national caller from Mesa, Arizona on April 12, a Tuesday.  Pre-Rounds at 7:30 will be cued by Christina Corelli.  The mainstream dance with plus tips will run from 8:00 - 10-:30 with Dan.  Please plan on joining us for this special dance.
 
Carol Campbell, who dances with us lost her husband recently.  We are all so very sorry.  Fred bravely battled cancer.  We offered gift cards to their favorite pizza places and will continue to take care of Carol. 
 
We continue to dance all levels from 5:30 - 8:00 most Sundays in Hall A at the hall in Sprngfield.  We encourage you to join us.  Please call Tim at 541-988-0399 or our president, David at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are dancing.  We rarely go dark, but you never know.    We do know that we are dark May 29, Memorial Day weekend. 
 
Our hall has a cushioned wood floor for your dancing ease and pleasure.
 
Happy dancing!
Christina Corelli
