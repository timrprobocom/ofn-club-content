February was a fun month with lots of special events. We had a Chocolate dance which filled the hall with lots of dancers and a featured a great chocolate fountain. Thank you to Sid and Clara Carter for setting up and manning the fountain. 
     Also we had a Chinese New Yearâ€™s dance with a Chinese Auction. There were lots of great items to bid on and fun was had by all. I guess that "FUN" is The Word for February and there is more to come so join us every first and third Fridays in Albany at the IOOF Hall.
