Thanks to everyone who attended our dances recently held at the alternate locations. For April, we plan to dance at our usual location, First Congregational Church, Corvallis, on the second and fourth Saturdays. Now that the floor has been refinished and scheduling worked out, we should be able to count on this usual venue for us. 
     By the time this OFN comes out, we will have had our Coast Retreat the weekend of March 11-13. Highlights include the dancing, of course, and the social time including the group potluck on Saturday at noon. It's not too early to save the second weekend in March for next year's Coast Retreat!
