May was a very good month.  In addition to our two regular dances the club was proud to help our Secretary, Melissa James, celebrate being cancer-free for 10 years.  There were some who came to celebrate with Melissa who were not dancers.  That did not slow things down.  Jim called some tips in mainstream, taught some round dance steps, as well as a line dance routine.  He put new dancers in squares with many angels and everyone had a great time.  We all were just there to let her know that square dancers care.  Money was collected for cancer research, but the exact amount is not known at this time.
 Our beginning square dance lessons will go through the summer, with beginners from 7:00 to 8:30 and mainstream from 8:30 to 9:00 PM. So, if you are finished with beginners or want to keep sharp with mainstream and your clubs goes dark in the summer, you are welcome to our lessons on Tuesday evenings at the Hazel Dell Grange.  And if you have friends that you can bring, we start a new cycle of lessons on the first Tuesday of each month.
 We dance Saturdays, 7-8 Plus 8-10 Mainstream, year round at Hazel Dell Grange, 7509 NE Hazel Dell Ave., Vancouver, WA 98665.  Our July 8th caller will be Mike Stout with Julie Stout cueing, and on July 22nd Jim Hattrick is calling and cueing.  Come join us for a good time.
