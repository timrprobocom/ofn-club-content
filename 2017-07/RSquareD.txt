On Friday May 12th R Square D hosted a Fiesta de Mayo Dance.  Tacos and all the fixin's were served before the dance.  Craig and Lonnie used Mexican music to keep our feet tapping through out the evening.  Cougar Squares went home with one of our travelling banners, because our President did not have the Cougars banner that we had recently taken.
 The club was dark on the 4th Saturday in observance of Memorial Day.  We hope that everyone had a good weekend and enjoyed the lovely weather that we were blessed with.
 In July we will dance on the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays.  On the 12th we will be serving Ice Cream Sundaes and will have a guest caller.  On the 26th we will serve Root Beer floats and Mike Stout will be calling.  All summer dances are casual.
 It is not too early to get Octoberfest ribbons, ask any member of the club, we can direct you to where to purchase them.  Club members have been working with members of the Rose Valley Grange to improve the acoustics in the hall. 
 For more information about us please visit our website at www.r-square-d.info or friend us on Facebook.  Our Caller for R Square D is Craig Abercrombie and our cuer is Lonnie Sycks.
