In May Tri Squares visited the Braids and Braves out in the beautiful wine country at the McMinnville Grange and we were sad to learn they have to relocate in the fall.  Also in May we elected new officers:  President Linda Brabham, Vice President Deb Mandeville, Secretary Gloria Davis, Treasurer Bob Davis, Dance Coordinator Lynnea Loveberg, and TVC Representative Frank Collett.
 On June 16th we plan to visit the Chaps and Petticoats in Aurora, and leading the dance will be our own caller Terry Halley and cuer Sandra Pinion.
 On June 24th we'll have a mystery trip, and as I write this I still don't know where!  We'll be carpooling, dancing a tip along the way, eating out, and surprising another club at their dance -- always so much fun.
 We'll go dark again this year for July and August, due to the summer heat.  But to keep our club dancing we plan to visit four other clubs with A/C:  River City Dancers, Hoedowners, Sunset Promenaders, and the Oaky Doaks.  So, along with the Salem Summerfest and the Hahn Barn dance, we'll be very busy.
 And a big congratulations to our long-time members, Wallace and Roberta Prowell, who are celebrating their 50th anniversary on June 18th.  Wow!
  Gloria Davis
