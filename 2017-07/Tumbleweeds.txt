The Tumbleweeds dance every Friday from 11:00 am to 2:00 pm, all year long. The day starts out with an hour of plus, then a half hour of round dancing. The mainstream dance begins at 12:30 pm and goes until 2:00 pm. Lunch after the dance. Please come and join us for a fun dance. The hall is well air-conditioned and very comfortable! Happy 4th of July everyone.
