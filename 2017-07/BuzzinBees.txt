Greetings from the Buzzin' Bees. Our club had its final dance of the season on June 3rd with a red, white and blue theme. A great time was had by all. We are dark now until September but we have several Club activities planned including a picnic at our former callers house in July and a campout in August.  Bill and Linda Lundin will host the picnic and we'll be camping out with our former cuer, Debbie and Mike Combs.

We hope you have a great summer and keep on dancing.

Debbie Broers
