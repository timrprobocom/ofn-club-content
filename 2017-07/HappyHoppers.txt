Summer is here and that means the Happy Hoppers will be dark for 2 months. July & August we close our doors and enjoy all the fun festivals and dances of the summer. Our only summer event is our annual picnic & BBQ on Aug 6th. This is an event for all our members and is always a popular get together, not to mention yummy food!

We celebrated our 58th anniversary in May with a wonderful Fiesta dance, and are looking forward to starting our 59th season on Sept 2nd. If you’re in the area on Labor Day weekend, please come join us.

We will have a new dance format this coming fall with Pre-rounds at 7PM and Plus from 7:30-9:45. We’ll have refreshments and announcements at 9:45.  We welcome visitors at all our dances and hope you’ll make plans to join us.
