Our special cuer Bev Flint and her husband Harlan are back cueing again.  We have missed them so much.  We wanted to thank Connie Clark for helping Bev out on her first attempt back to cue after surgery.  They fired up the hall for our Cinco de Mayo dance, at the first of the month.  We have been out visiting other clubs as a group and couples.  The Tualatin Timber Squares gave us a fun night for one of our visitations.  Thanks for sharing all of your energy and enthusiasm.  We had a great group from River City Dancers for our Sadie Hawkins dance.  They helped us fill the floor with fun and energy too.  The ice cream social was a smashing success.
 June 16th is our regular dance, following up on July 7th with a BBQ and pot luck before the dance to help us celebrate KCâ€™s birthday.  That will be a night of surprises.  Come and join us.  July 21st is our regular dance and remember casual clothes are welcomed during the summer months.
 We are looking forward to our Progressive Mystery Dinner.  We are coming dressed as the Romans did, eating great food, being with friends and trying to solve a murder mystery.  Should be a great evening.  Come join us for a dance or two.  We love visitors coming to help us dance the night away.  See you in a square.
