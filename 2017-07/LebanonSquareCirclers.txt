IT WAS A GLORIOUS WEEKEND -- JUNE 1 - 3, 2017 -- LEBANON STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL WEEKEND! Activities began on Thursday evening with a club potluck and float decorating party at Marilyn York's home. The event was highlighted by the presentation of our new float trailer. The trailer frame was donated by John and Wanda Frenzel and then there were many work parties to complete the trailer under the direction and coordination skills of Frank Cawrse and Larry Baker. Nick Heineck, Fred Schafer, John Frenzel, Doris Nelson, Rosalie Weischedel, Bill Fiock, Robb Norman, Wanda Frenzel, and Ben Schmidt helped in the construction and painting of this awesome trailer. Thus the Club was able to participate in the community Strawberry Festival parade as was its custom for over 60 years. There were potlucks on both Friday and Saturday nights prior to the dances. The Friday night Trails End Dance had callers and cuers from the floor.  Lots of fun!  

On Saturday night Randy Dibble called and Jackie Gale cued. It was a great dance with over 10 squares on the floor. Our Silent Auction was a super success under the direction of Kaynor Heineck, the Experienced Clothing Sale was supervised by Grace Christensen, and the weekend ended with a Sunday morning pancake breakfast. We were delighted to have so many dancers attend our festival weekend. 

Our club members will be attending the Pioneer Picnic dance in Brownsville on Fatherâ€™s Day and during the summer we have a variety of special events to attend. Have a wonderful summer. Marilyn York
