Please attend our dance July 1st at Aloha Grange.  The caller is yet to be decided, and the cuer is Connie Clark.  We are dark July 15th for Summer Festival.
 Our dances in May were small but fun.  Only one person, myself, attended our visitation to the 10 Year Anniversary Cancer-Free Dance celebrating Melissa James' recovery.
 Our new officers are Carolene Siebert, President; Pete Cooper, Vice President; Bill Calder, Secretary; Andis Garuts, Treasurer; Bea Cook TVC Rep 1; Ed Schlott TVC Rep 2; Sharon Tefelske, Past President.
