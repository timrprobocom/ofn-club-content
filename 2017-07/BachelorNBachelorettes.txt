Although there is no evidence theme dances do anything to increase attendance, they can still be a lot of fun for the members.  Weâ€™ll have a Crazy T-Shirt dance July 19th.  So, wear your T-Shirt, or come overdressed to our dance.

Ever popular Les Seeley will be with us July 19.  Come join us for our legendary caller.

We now have two plus tips after break, and our dance donation is now $6.  Our bookkeeper, Debbie Debit, says the plus tips cost more money.
