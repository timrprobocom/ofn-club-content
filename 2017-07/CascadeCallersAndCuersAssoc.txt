Our next scheduled dance isn't until September 30.  We have a meeting and dance on the Fifth Saturdays during the year. We are dark July 29th while the floor is being refinished.  We look forward to a beautiful floor.

One of our caller members, Gail Jackson, had cancer surgery.  Our thoughts and prayers for successful recovery and no more cancer!  Gail is our treasurer.  She has worked with our bank to make things not only easier but cost-saving as well. 

Keep on dancing!
Christina Corelli, Secretary, CCCA
