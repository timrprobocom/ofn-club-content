May I say May didn’t stay long enough.  Maybe it was the Hippy Dance on the 13th that got my internal calendar askew.  It was amazing comparing everyone’s recollections of just what those days were like; is it Hippy or Hippie? psychedelic light shows, mustaches, VW vans, rainbows, bell bottoms, long hair, peace, love and rock and roll, headbands, tie dye, the Doors, big hoop earrings, flowers in your hair, boots, flowy skirts, Jimi Hendrix, summer of love .  Hmmm, not much of that music really works for square dancing but Daryl stepped up to the challenge and found a few.  Hey folks, Sergeant Peppers Lonely Heart’s Club Band album is 50 years young, it still sounds great and was just re-released!  Wow!  The walls were decorated with peace symbols and daisies, dancers were decorated with flowers, headbands and peace symbols.  It was groovy as they say.
 The Red, White and Blue Dance had some surprises.  Everyone had fun, dancing was great and Hoedowners had their first experience with the Hoedowner Spinnin’ and Winnin’ Wheel.  Wayne and Darlene outdid themselves this time.  
 July will see a Luau Dance on the 8th.  I can smell the pikake now.  Then, on July 22nd will be Floatin’ Away on a fine summer’s evening.  Come and enjoy our root beer floats and summer music.  You can bring your own tube or air mattress if you like.
