The Cha class has eased its way into Rumba dancing and took a week off from class to celebrate our 41st birthday on June 15. We will continue exploring more Latin rhythms for the rest of the summer.
We had a guest cuer in June in the form of Jeanine Norden. We had a great time with her list of dances for us to enjoy. She will be back in the fall for another of Cherylâ€™s nights off for family time. I think we have another guest cuer coming in July, but have not heard who is coming yet. 
We salute Julia Buchheit who came in first with her cueing at the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival. Julia, along with her family, is part of the Cha/Rumba class we are currently having. Congratulations Julia. We support you in continuing your cueing experiences.
Come join us on Thursdays starting at 6:30. It is always a good time for those who attend. Marilyn Schmit
