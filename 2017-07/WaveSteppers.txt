The Tillamook County Fair is coming up in August, and on Thursday, August 10, the Wave Steppers will be doing a square dance, line dance, and clogging demo on the Courtyard Stage in the center of the fairgrounds.  This is the second year we’ve done this.  Club caller Joe Wrabek will be calling the squares, and line dance coach Gwen Kiel will lead the line dancers and cloggers.  Like last year, we’ll have a couple folks in square dance regalia working the crowd, handing out coupons for a new round of square dance classes starting in September.
 The Wave Steppers’ July dance, Saturday, July 8th will feature Harvey Hunsucker calling and cueing.  Club caller Joe Wrabek and line dance instructor Gwen Kiel will be doing the club’s County Fair Dance Saturday, August 12th.
The Wave Steppers’ anniversary dance Saturday, September 9th will be an Elvis Dance, with caller Mark Wheeler as Elvis, and cuer Connie Clark.
 All the club’s dances are held at Garibaldi City Hall (107 6th Street, at Acacia).  About two-thirds of the building’s second floor is a dance floor, built in the 1940s by the Fire Department for the old Firemen’s Balls.
