IWW has a new Board and we are looking forward to a new club year. Thanks to our outgoing President Barbi (Lee) Ashwill and Vice-President Barbara Tipton for their outstanding leadership and for the support and encouragement that they have provided to our other hard-working Board members and club committees. Hats are off to Joni O’Brien, recipient of the “Good Scout Award” for above-and-beyond service. 

 43 members attended the Koast Krash held at the Yachats Inn the weekend of April 21.  The theme was Wizard of Oz and costumes were encouraged. Most of the Oz characters were represented, including a tree and flying monkeys. The Munchkins loved the Wicked Witch’s legs protruding from under the house. We enjoyed games, golf, shopping, hiking, food (highlighted by a taco/nacho bar Saturday evening) and fun. A HUGE thank you goes to organizers Eugene and Bonnie Ivey and George and Patty Hermann.

Roger Putzler was guest caller at our first May dance. Nice to have you back, Roger! We are looking forward to a Demo dance on August 19 at the Polk County Fairgrounds as part of the Solar Eclipse Celebration and hope to have many squares from other clubs come and dance with us.
