It’s not too late to attend our 5th Friday dance June 30.  Take a peek at our flyer!

I’m always intrigued by what happens in July.  We all know there are too many clubs for the number of dancers we have.  Starting in July, we become aware of which clubs are going to fold, which are going to merge (to combine talent) and which are going to become “traveling clubs”.  It will be interesting to see how it all percolates out.  One very good thing about losing clubs is that our talent is not so diluted.

Your club’s ability to have fund raisers is also an important ingredient both for your treasury and attracting new members.  Most non-profits have to have fund raisers.  It’s sad our Chaps and Petticoats have to sacrifice the summer festival for their fund raiser, but we know how necessary fund raisers are.  It’s sort of like a public safety officer who has to work Christmas.

Your club’s ability to survive any consolidation of clubs will depend on how innovative and flexible it can be to attract new members and incorporate new ideas.  This will make for a strong club, and only the strong shall survive.
