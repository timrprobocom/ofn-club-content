Happy Summer !!  We dance all summer long in our air conditioned hall so come join us!!  We dance three times in June as there is a fifth Friday. That means a Plus Dance with an Advanced session at 7:30 pm. We begin the evening with Intermediate Rounds at 7:00 pm.  Randy Dibble is our Caller and Jeanine Norden is our Cuer.

On June 7, 10 students graduated from our Mainstream lessons and we welcomed seven of those into our club. Congratulations! We look forward to seeing you this summer on our dance floor. Sheila Machado
