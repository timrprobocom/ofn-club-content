The Country Cut-Ups will start off July with a picnic open to the public on July 1st. Jim Hattrick will be calling and will introduce square dancing to any interested visitors ahead of our usual dance. We will be selling sausages with coleslaw and beans with other side dishes for the picnic. Picnic is at 5:30 PM, Plus starts at 7:00 PM, and Mainstream at 7:30 PM. Come and join us for the fun! 

On Sunday, July 9th, from 2 to 4:30 PM, we are having a B51 level dance to encourage our current mainstream class and any recent graduates in the area to get some floor time. Scott Zinser will be calling.

We will be having demonstrations or showing up at community events throughout the summer in order to promote our upcoming Mainstream lessons, starting September 14th. Our lessons are on Thursdays with Scott Zinser, 7:30 to 9:30 PM.

We will close out July with a 5th Saturday all Plus level dance on the 29th. We will have a Beach Party theme and dance to oldies, casual dress. George and Patty Hermann will be calling and cueing. Hope to see you there!
