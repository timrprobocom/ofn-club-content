We are dark this month, but most of our members will be at Summer Festival. We are planning to have our trophies and scrapbook on display. Our youth are also running the concession stand and we will have the new Teen Festival pins for next year on sale - please stop by and say hello and buy a pin from us. The pin will also act as your ticket/ribbon/entrance to next year's Teen Festival here in Oregon.

Mom (Karyn Buchheit) is still waiting for a definite answer from Silverton High School. Right now she is planning on that as the location for the Teen Festival. We will keep people updated as we find out more information. She will also need LOTS of volunteers - you can send her an email or give her a call to let her know if you can help and if you have a preference for where you would like to help.

Thomas Buchheit started a mainstream class on June 11. More info on how it is going next month. We are planning to have a trailer in the Homer Davenport Parade the first Saturday in August. If we are lucky, there will be some new dancers from Thomas' class to join us!  Petrina Buchheit
