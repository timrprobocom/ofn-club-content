<li><a>Bob Osgood Biography</a>
<div>
<p>Bob Osgood was one of the founders of Modern Western Square Dancing as we now know it. &nbsp;He studied under Lloyd 'Pappy' Shaw, and taught some of the first square dance classes in the Los Angeles area. &nbsp;Later, he started the square dance magazine Sets In Order, and was fundamental in establishing Callerlab. &nbsp;Now, Paul Moore, a long time friend of Osgood, has compiled a biography that also serves as a complete history of Modern Western Square Dancing. &nbsp;The book is available&nbsp;<a title="As I Saw It" href="https://www.amazon.com/As-I-Saw-Bob-Osgood/dp/1539090981">on Amazon</a>, and all proceeds go to the Callerlab Foundation.</p>
