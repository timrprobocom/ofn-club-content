We now have 8 new members!  This has been a big boost for our club.  We still need the help of the Wave Steppers and other clubs.  Needless to say, we are very happy.  We are dancing on the 1st & 3rd Friday’s doing Plus and on the 1st & 3rd Saturday’s Mainstream through July.  You still need to call if you plan to attend a dance.  Numbers are 503.861.2726 and 503.325.8109.  Hooray!!
