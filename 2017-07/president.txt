<p>Two and one half months left in my term as your Federation President. It has gone by quickly but a lot has happened in that time. We lost Ron&rsquo;s brother and then his wife six weeks later. My mom has been hospitalized and just back to her assisted living facility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My travel plans to make it around the Federation in my term has been slowed down, but I still intend to visit each council. I have PAC, S. Coast, Central Oregon, and Rogue Sis-Q left to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been working on the state directory and there are still a few clubs left to report their new officers. All forms are due at Summer Festival. Each directory is $3.25 again this year. You can order yours through your club or council delegate. They will be distributed during the September state meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you working on advertising for your fall classes yet? Now is a good time to get your plans all put together and get flyers out to attract new students. You can send me flyers to use for State Fair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State Fair is also nearing for public dancing. We have four days to dance. Two are definite: Saturday of Labor Day weekend for the youth and two hours also! Monday of Labor Day weekend for those who cannot get time off during the week. Two other dates are still being worked on. One will be dedicated to round dancing. So keep your eyes and ears open for more news.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guess I will close this for now. Keep dancing and take your recent class graduates with you. They need the floor time.&nbsp;</p>
