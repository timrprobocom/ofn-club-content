It was Alien Days in McMinnville but none visited our dance May 20. We did have, however, visitors from four different clubs, including Bruce Lowther and Judy Russell from the Albany Timber Twirlers. Bruce called a tip and Judy cued a set of rounds for us. We had a fun time thanks to our great caller, Leonard Snodgrass and fantastic cuer, Sandra Pinion. 

We will be dark in July and August and in September we will have a new location. Stay tuned so you will know where we are moving. See you in a square, hopefully at Summer Festival in Salem, and happy dancing. Carmen
