We had a great dance for Pie Night on Memorial Day; a little over four squares. Thank you to all the visiting dancers.
 Some of us visited Chaps and Petticoats for their Salute to Veterans dance. I don’t think that is the name they called it but it was a nice dance to thank all of our Veterans.  A couple of us went to the Saturday night dance in Lebanon for the Strawberry Festival for the first time which was very enjoyable.
 We are currently running mainstream lessons every Monday night from 6 – 7:30 so we are not having Pre-Rounds on our dance nights. You are welcome to help Angel or make your own square and practice being in the opposite position than what you normally dance. I always have fun trying to do that. We have a few extra door prizes during the weeks of lessons. Please be patient while we try to build up our club and try to help the square dance community also grow. Teija
