Dave Pebworth as MC led the installation of our officers for 2017-2018.  Our dedicated board is as follows: Chief Dam Builders - Karen and Ferrous Steinka;  Assistant Dam Builders - Sally and Mike Duyck; Log Thumper - Judy Martin;  Gnawer - Marie Clem ;  TVC representatives - Ken  Marifke, and for her 2nd year - Kay Rogers. 
 Eighteen TVC dancers including Six Eager Beavers attended the Apple Blossom Festival in Leavenworth Washington and reported they enjoyed an excellent dance weekend. 
 Our Plus students graduated and have done very well.  I think they can now go to any Plus Dance and hold their own with the “old timers” who “Never” make mistakes.  If you believe that last one I will sell you beach front property in Arizona.
 Call Kay Rogers if you are interested in attending our Seaside Beach trip October 4th - 6th, at 503-396-5537 (some people may have to put a “1” in front of the number).  She has all the answers. 
 We are planning ahead so our Anniversary Dance does not conflict with Hillsboro’s Street Fair Event next year.  Our dance will be the third Sunday, April 15, 2018.  Now you can plan ahead. 
 NOTE:  We will dance at the Aloha Grange on the following Mondays: June 26th and July 3rd (our Independence Day Dance) as the church will be unavailable.
 We dance on most holidays.  Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 to 3:00 pm, at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
