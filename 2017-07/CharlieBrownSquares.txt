Wow!! Can't believe it's summer already. June saw our January class graduate. Small class, but very enthusiastic new dancers. Fun dances in June with Ray and guest cuers Bob Dingman and Elaine Funk. Dances were small, but again, as long as everyone is smiling and having fun...that is the most important part of dancing. The Charlie's also participated in the Frog Oâ€™Faire with 2 squares putting on a fun demo.  Thanks to Chuck for calling the demo and bringing some of his students as well.
We only have 1 dance left before we go dark in August. July 1st we will have Ray calling and Sarge cueing our Firecracker Dance. It's an all skate and will also be Ray's last official dance as our caller.  I hope we get a good turn out to wish him well.  He is staying in the area, so I am sure we will see him once in awhile. 
We are dark for our July 15th dance, so everyone can attend Summer Festival in Salem.  It's a great event with National Caller Johnny Preston and cuers Ray and Sherry Garza. Hope to see lots of Southern Oregon dancers there.
Boatnik weekend was just wonderful. Hunter Keller and Randy Lewis were fabulous and we all had a great time!! Enjoyed a trip on the jet boat Monday and we were so glad to have Hunter, Randy and Debbie stay an extra day to enjoy that with us. Our wheels are already turning with ideas for Boatnik 2018 with Tony Oxendine and Sharon Parker!! Can't wait. 
Look forward to seeing everyone on the dance floor soon!
