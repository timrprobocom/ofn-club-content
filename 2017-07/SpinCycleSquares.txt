We dance Sundays at 5:30 at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.  Hall A in front.   Come and join us for some FUN floor time.  Check the When and Where for any dark dates.  Dark dates for us are few, but they do happen from time to time.  We love visitors!
Tim, our capable caller, calls and teaches all levels from beginners through advanced.

We are dark July 23 and 30.  The floors will be refinished during the last couple of weeks in July.  The smell may be too much for some dancers, and this will give the floor time to dry and be beautiful! 

The current board of Spin Cycle Squares was unanimous in their decision to serve another year.  Thank you so much.  David Lajoie-President, Kurt Jensen-Vice-President, Cheryl Hagey-Secretary, Lorna Mercer-Treasurer and Christina Corelli-Member-at-Large. 

Happy Dancing!
