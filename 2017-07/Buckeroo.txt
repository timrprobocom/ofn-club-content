This past weekend the Buckeroo Barn was transformed into a jungle for our annual Buckeroo Round-Up. We had a jam packed weekend with Dan Nordbye calling  and Maryann Callahan cuing. We had dances on Friday and Saturday evenings and great “funshops” on Saturday. Dancers came from near and far to join us out on the dance floor.
As part of the Round Up this year, we had a benefit dance for the Wildlife Safari. We danced under the Safari Dome at the Wildlife Safari Sunday from 10 am to 5 pm. Dan Nordbye called and Maryann Callahan cued in the morning, and then the afternoon was filled with jamboree callers and cuers. We had a wonderful time dancing, seeing the animals,  and helping raise money for a good cause.
We hold the Buckaroo Round Up on the second weekend in June, so mark your calendar now and plan to join us next year. In 2018 we will have Scot Byers calling and his lovely wife Erin cuing. 
We dance the first and third Saturdays here at the barn. We are an easy drive from almost anywhere along I5, and would love to dance with you at the Buckeroo Barn!
