The Tualatin Timber Squares have completed lessons and will be having regular mainstream dances on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday's only.  This is a great dance to come to for those fresh out of class or those who would like some extra help practicing a pesky call or two.  Everyone is welcome! 
 If the weather reaches 90 degrees we will be dark.  We will post on our website as well: www.TualatinDance.com
