At Willamette Squares' dance over Memorial Day weekend, we honored the veterans who were present with special recognition. They came forward and indicated in which branch of the military they served and were awarded a special flag pin as a token of thanks for their service. 
Sandy Harris, our caller, and Jackie Gale, our cuer, were decked out in red, white, and blue, and the decorations were red, white, and blue as well. Many of the singing calls were of a patriotic theme, and they put everyone in a festive, thoughtful mood. As usual, there was an ample supply of food; everyone ate their fill, and there was still food left over. 

Willamette Squares is looking forward to the upcoming Summer Festival by participating as dancers or volunteering. We are also preparing for square and round dance lessons coming up in the fall. Jodee Howard
