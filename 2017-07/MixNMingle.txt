As the weather transitions almost overnight from cool and wet to hot and dry, it's time to mention again to keep an eye on our web page.  Besides mentioning that we will go dark July 15th for Midsummer Festival, we will post the information if the heat makes us cancel.
 We hope that our usual summer refreshments, the traditional Red, White, and Blue dance with Dan's homemade ice cream, trimmed with berries, both red and blue, the Root Beer Float Dance, and the cooling watermelon dance will help us through the summer months.  Those will be served in the grange's basement, which usually manages to stay cooler even during the hot spells.
 Also, don't forget that our summer dances are casual, as are any others when the thermometer passes what is tolerable.
