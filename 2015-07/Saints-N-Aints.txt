Well, time got away from me last month so I did not get a report written for the OFN. Now to play catch up!  

The birthday dance in May was well attended.  Thanks go out to Dale Roberson who filled in for Sherm while he was out of town. We always enjoy his calling.  We had several visitors from Roseburg – thank you!

Our Cinco de Mayo Live Band dance was a big success. We even had visitors from Portland!
Thanks to all of you who came and enjoyed the dancing and great food!  Sherm really likes calling with a live band!

Our 5th Saturday Area Dance was held in Coquille (Sets-in-Order) on May 30 with Coleeta Quigley calling and Denise Harris cuing and a fun evening was had by all who attended.

Several Saints-n-Aints attended the Coquille Gay 90&rsquo;s Day parade and danced on the float with Sets-in-Order then came back to Coos Bay and danced the night away with their own club. What stamina!  

With regards to our July dances – we will be DARK on the 4th but we will dance on the 3rd Saturday so if you are unable to attend Summer Fest maybe you could join us.

July and August dances will be casual dress. Come on over and enjoy the beautiful Oregon Coast!  And our caller, Sherm, is taking the summer off so we will have guest callers for those months.

Happy Dancing!
Linda
