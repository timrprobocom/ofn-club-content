&lsquo;Come dance the evening away as we celebrate our nation&rsquo;s birthday!&rsquo;  The first Saturday of July is the 4th and it is our Independence Day Dance.  We&rsquo;ve begun our summer schedule with Intermediate Rounds from 7:00-7:20, a workshop 7:20-7:40 (Rounds on the 1st Saturday and Squares on the 3rd Saturday), Easy Rounds from 7:40-8:00 and Main Stream from 8:00-11:00.  K.C. Curtis will be calling and Helen Halley will be cueing.  Mark Wheeler is calling and Molly Combs is cueing for our third Saturday dance.

Our heartfelt gratitude to the callers and cuers who have helped us out during Mike&rsquo;s surgery and recovery,  A BIG THANK YOU to each of you for your good thoughts and prayers.

A &lsquo;heads up&rsquo; for our August 1st dance – &lsquo;The Big Birthday Bash&rsquo; at which time we will be featuring &ldquo;Special Milestones – those significant birthdays and anniversaries of 2015&rsquo;.  Remember -- anyone who has a birthday in 2015 is welcome!  

With temperatures already in the 90&rsquo;s we are happy our Hall is air conditioned.  Join us for a dance or two in comfort.
