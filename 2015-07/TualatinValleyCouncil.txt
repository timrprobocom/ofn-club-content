The Tualatin Valley Council has grown from ten member clubs to eleven!  The Columbia River Dancers are now members of the TVC.  This club was formed in September of 2014 and had their first dance without a name!   Dancers submitted 46 names, 9 rose to the top, and one was chosen on OCT 14th - Columbia River Dancers!  Dancing at the Vancouver YMCA on the 2nd and 4th Saturdays, they are a family, single/solo, couple friendly club.  Their caller/cuer is Richard Lane (Leslye), one of our local callers with a national pedigree.
 On May 30th the TVC hosted a Spring Fling dance at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro, in tribute to Jim Hattrick who is experiencing health issues.  There were 11 squares of dancers in attendance with 13 callers and cuers!  Our MC's Daryl Clendenin and Tami Helms were assisted by Mike and Julie Stout, Tim Keck, Ken Pratt, Julie Stiers, George Clark, Joyce Hooper, Connie Clark, KC Curtis, and Darrell Kalmbach.  We all had a wonderful time.  The Sunset Promenaders claimed the TVC banner by having 47% of their club present, edging out the   Hoedowners with 41%.
