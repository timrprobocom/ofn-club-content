April Showers bring May flowers and what a beautiful Spring we&rsquo;ve had here in the Pacific Northwest. 
 R Square D celebrated Cinco de Mayo with a Fiesta de Mayo dance on May 8th, lots of traditional Mexican foods and some spicy dancing going on.  The club then went dark for the Memorial Day weekend. 
 We at R Square D are proud of all the new dancers and will honor them with a graduation celebration on the 27th.  
 We start our summer schedule of having our dances on Wednesdays the first week in June.  Dances will be on the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays.  July 8th is our Freedom Dance and on the 22nd we will have a Denim dance, please come and join us. 
 A big Thank you goes out to Holly Pennock for all her hard work creating and maintaining our Facebook page.

 Remember to be thankful for friendships and keep on dancing.
