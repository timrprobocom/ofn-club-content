What a great dance we had May 27th.  – Jim Steele, of all people – a voice from the past.  Even the Royal Romp officers turned out to see him!  This is one of the advantages to having guest callers and cuers – a wide variety of talent.

Please remember that we are dark Jul 8th, while the grange refinishes our floor.  I&rsquo;m told it will be coated in something called &ldquo;Satin Sandpaper Finish&rdquo;, whatever that is.  I&rsquo;m just told it is non-slick, yet cleans and scrubs the soles of our dance shoes at the same time.  I guess we won&rsquo;t have to worry about sliding around on slick floors and falling on our derrièrs?  I&rsquo;m also guessing we shouldn&rsquo;t dance on it barefoot?

Other great dances will be our 4th of July dance on July 1st, and our Beach Party dance on July 22nd.  Club Auditor, Buck Cashout, is getting ready to cash in on these dances!  Remember, too much of a good thing is wonderful!
