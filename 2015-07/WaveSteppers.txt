One change in the Wave Steppers&rsquo; 2015 dance schedule&mdash;the club&rsquo;s September 12 dance will be called by Darrell Kalmbach, with line dance coach Gwen Kiel.  September is the club&rsquo;s anniversary; according to old (and sometimes sketchy) records, there&rsquo;s been a square dance club in Garibaldi going back to the early 1900s.
 Our July 11th dance will feature George Clark calling and cueing.  This dance will have a patriotic theme so come dressed in your finest red, white, and blue.
  The Wave Steppers&rsquo; square dance classes, taught by club caller Joe Wrabek, continue every Wednesday evening at the Tillamook Elks Lodge, 1907 Third St. in downtown Tillamook.  The classes are free.
 All the club&rsquo;s dances are held the second Saturday of the month, on the Dance Floor at Garibaldi City Hall, 107 6th St. (one block off US 101).  The Garibaldi Inn and Suites, located half a block away, offers discounts for dancers spending the night.  Please visit our webpage for up to date information, www.wavesteppers.org.
