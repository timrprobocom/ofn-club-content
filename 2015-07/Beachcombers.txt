Port Orford Beachcombers are gearing up for our annual Battle Rock Festival held over Labor Day Weekend.  We always have a lot of fun activities planned for this time and hope you all make plans to come down to the beautiful southern Oregon coast and join us for a weekend of dancing fun and fellowship.  The weather is always great at that time of year!
