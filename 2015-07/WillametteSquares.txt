The Willamette Squares dance the end of May took place Memorial Day weekend and honored our Veterans. Sandy Harris, our caller, and Jackie Gale, our cuer, did a wonderful job incorporating singing calls and cues that matched the occasion. One table was devoted to photos of the veterans among us, and at one point during the dance, all veterans were asked to come up front and be recognized for their service. Georgette Hagerman handed out double flag pins to each veteran present, shook their hands, and personally thanked each one of them on behalf of Willamette Squares and guests. As usual, the dancing and food were excellent, and everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves. Jodee Howard
