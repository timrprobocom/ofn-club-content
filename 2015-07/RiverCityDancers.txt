We have cancelled our third Saturday dance on July 18  to attend Summer Festival in Klamath Falls.

Our main focus the last few months has been to raise funds to cover the expense of replacing the roof on our hall.  A presentation by Eric Foxman, a garage sale and most recently a concert by Ted Vigil have been very successful.  Ted will perform June 28, so it may not be too late to buy your tickets.  See the flyer in the June edition of the OFN for more information.  If you were a fan of John Denver, you are in for a real treat.  He looks like him and sings the same songs.

Our annual campout is later this month in Cougar, Washington.  We will camp, hike, play games, and, of course, eat and square and round dance.  It is always a fund weekend.
