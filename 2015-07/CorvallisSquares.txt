      Corvallis Squares club is dark for July and August but we are happy to see there are a variety of summer dances up and down the valley. We look forward to attending some of these opportunities. 
     We are already planning for our fall lessons. We've found most students who attend our lessons have been personally invited by a club member. So that will be emphasized, along with flyers and other forms of publicity that we've used in the past. We hope to put on some demo dances, one at the Benton County Fair and one at Corvallis's Fall Festival and we will have lesson information available for interested people!  Karen
