The Square and Round Dancers of Central Oregon met on the morning of June 7th to walk in a Heaven Can Wait 5K (one dancer ran the 5K).  We all wore felt signs on our backs letting everyone, over a thousand participants, know that we represented square/round dancers.  The event is organized by the Foundation of St. Charles Hospital of Bend.  There were costumes, balloons, pink tutus, and tons of pink in the crowd.  This event supports the Sara Fisher Project promoting Breast Cancer Awareness.  Afterwards, we all remarked how rewarding and gratifying it felt to participate in the race and plan to walk/run again next year.
