May 29th was one of our better attended council dances, in which we had a little over eight squares attend.  Snacks are now a potluck affair, rather than the responsibility of any one club.

Our Starlite Parade entry also did well, with about three squares attending, most prominently by the Silver City Squares and their two affiliated youth auxiliaries: Silver Dragons and Silver Knights.  More importantly, this appears to be the first time in several years that our entry has made a good showing.  Danny and Carol seem to be making plans to organize it again next year.
