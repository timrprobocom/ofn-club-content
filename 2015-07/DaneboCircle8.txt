We are dark in July.  More news next time. 
 
Our club dances the first and third Saturdays of each month except for July and one dance (third Saturday in May).  We voted to continue with two dances a month although our numbers are down and having one dance a month was an option.  Please come and dance with us the first and third Saturdays in August.  We have a cushioned wood floor and air conditioning.  Also, our summer dances are casual dress&#8203;. 
 
We are dark September 5&#8203;th,&#8203; as that is Labor Day weekend.
 
See you in a square,
