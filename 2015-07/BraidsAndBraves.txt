     Braids and Braves danced on our trailer in the annual McMinnville Alien Days parade in May. We had great fun dancing and interacting with the many, many people in the parade crowd and the other costumed "aliens" in the parade. The downtown area was packed with onlookers who were spilling out off the sidewalks and onto the streets. Later, after the parade, we hosted an "out of this world" Alien dance of four squares and many guests for this fun dance. Special thanks to K.C. Curtis who was our guest caller for both events.
     Two-step lessons are continuing with our cuer, Sandra Pinion. Our students are working hard and learning the steps very quickly. We are looking forward to seeing our new round dancers stepping out on the floor at our club dances very soon.
     We held club election of officers at our April business meeting and will be installing the new officers at our June meeting. Jennie Ramer
