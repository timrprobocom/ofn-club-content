<div>
<p>
Longtime Oregonian Norman Charles Roberts passed away on June 15, 2015.
Born in Portland February 25, 1936, he grew up in North Portland and
graduated from Jefferson High School in 1954.  He married Karen Esther
Walden in July, 1958.  They moved to NE Portland in October, 1959,
and stayed there 53 years until her passing.
<p>
Norm had a 45-year career as a warehouseman at Northern Specialty Sales.
He spent 16 years serving in the Oregon National Guard, and was a charter
member of the Gateway Elks Lodge.  Norm and Karen bowled every week for
many years, and were active in many Oregon square dance clubs.  They 
were members of the Swingin' Archies, and were charter members of 
Aces &amp; Lace.  They rarely missed a Mid-Winter Festival.
<p>
Norm is survived by a sister, Shirley Daves of Milwaukie; a brother,
Jerry Roberts, of Vancouver; two sons, Tim Roberts of Tigard, and Mark
Roberts of Clackamas; and four grandchildren, Andrea Adzima, Amanda
Roberts, Krista Roberts, and Jonathan Roberts.
<p>
Memorial service will be 1 PM Saturday, June 20, at Finley Sunset Hills
Mortuary.  In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the Dominican
Sisters of San Jose, at https://msjdominicans.org/SupportOurMission.
