Our caller, Tim Matteson, flew to St. Louis for the annual IAGSDC convention. There were 820 in attendance. this year. Tim learned a lot about figures, club development, websites, technology, etc.  It was worthwhile.   The largest club is now Puddletown in Seattle.  Philadelphia won the vote for the convention in 2019.  Denver is the only club in line to present a proposal next year for 2020. Other upcoming years are Toronto 2016, Palm Springs 2017, and Seattle 2018. All planned future conventions will be during the Fourth of July weekend. In addition to the delegates meeting Tim attended a club development meeting hosted by All Join Hands. Tim learned that a lot of dancers come from the fieldd of healthcare, education, and technology. Having a welcoming up to date website is also very important and something that could be worked on by most clubs. All Join Hands does have development funds available that we can consider requesting for future events.  Tim had us doing the figures presented and worked on at the convention.  He worked us hard, but it was FUN!  Thanks Tim! 
 
We look forward to our annual Pride Dance on August 22nd.  National caller Kris Jensen will be calling.  Kris is the sister of Kurt Jensen, one of our Spin Cycle Squares members.  Kris does a superb job of calling and ensuring FUN for all dancers.  We are also doing a demo dance at Eugene LGBT Pride on August 8th.  Time to be determined later.   Tim gets couples in one very large circle and teaches them several calls.  It is a lot of fun.
