Valley River Dancers were the guests of the Toe Draggers on their annual mystery trip in June. The group danced on the steps of the Oregon State Capitol, entertained young women at Oak Creek Youth Correctional Facility in Albany, and enjoyed the hospitality of the Lebanon Square Circlers at their annual Strawberry Festival potluck and dance. We thank both clubs for their gracious hospitality and generosity. We had a blast. 

Speaking of festivals, our wildly popular Dance Under the Stars, part of the Newberg Old Fashioned Festival, is slated for Friday evening, July 24. You're invited to come early and enjoy the booths and entertainment, then join us for some skirt-twirling, bolo-bouncing fun. Please see our flyer for details. 

Congratulations to the Silver City Squares for capturing the Mid-Willamette Valley banner from us. Many clubs in the council competed for the honor, and we accept your challenge to win it back!
