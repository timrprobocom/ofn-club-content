The Silver Stars will be dark the months of July and August while we dance at other clubs, at the many weekend events around the Pacific Northwest, as well as the Washington and Oregon State Festivals.  We wish our club members as well as our dancing friends safe travels.  We have some social activities planned and look forward to the new dance year beginning in September.  Hugs and yellow rocks to all.
