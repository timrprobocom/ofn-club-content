Recently the Sunset Promenaders visited the R Square D in Kelso at their Cinco de Mayo Dance and had a great time.  Craig Abercrombie called and cued a great dance and the dancers were a friendly bunch.  We also visited the Hoedowners with Daryl and Yvonne calling and cueing; we always have a good time with them, and we got our banner back.
 Thursday, July 2nd, is our Promenaders Plus Dance with Darrell Kalmbach Calling and Ken Pratt Cueing.  This dance is a fun time for Plus dancers with some tricky calling and a little teach here and there.  Darrell is very good at watching the floor and catching those little errors you make and helping you with it; he is a joy to dance to.
 We are looking forward to our Independence Day Dance on July 4th; and we are having root beer floats at the break, but first we will be dancing to Mike Stout&rsquo;s Calling and Ken Pratt&rsquo;s Cueing in our air-conditioned hall; so come on over and help us celebrate.
 We have a mystery trip planned for Saturday, July 11th, with both the Valley Squares and the Sunset Promenaders; last year was a great time together.  
 Thursday, July 16th, we have a Promenaders Plus dance; you Plus dancers come and dance with us.
 July 18th the Sunset Promenaders are going to be dark in support of the Summer Festival in Klamath Falls.
