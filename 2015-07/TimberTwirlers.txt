      Another dance season has come to an end and Timber Twirlers will be dark until September. We had a great dance year and thank you to all that joined in the fun. Thank you also to the loyal club members that worked so hard to put on fun dances with fun themes. A Special Thank you to our caller Bruce Lowther and partner Judy Russell for all their hard work, and since I am not only the club reporter but the club cuer, I will pat myself on the back also. 
     We are looking for a new dance hall as the wonderful place we danced this year has decided to go in another direction, so we are again without a place to dance. If you know of a place in the Albany area, please feel free to let one of us know. You can find our contact info on the state website. Have a great summer ---Sandy
