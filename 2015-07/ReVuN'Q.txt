     We continued with Mambo until June 11. Then we have two more weeks before the big event of our 39th birthday and a retirement dance for Ray and Virginia Walz. We are planning a great time and two hours of dancing, reminiscing, and wishing them well as they take time for themselves in retirement. 
     We have a guest cuer, Christina Corelli, for the June 25 lesson date and Jeanine Norden will be with us for two weeks in July while Cheryl and Geof are gone. 
     On July 30, we will start about five to six weeks of Bolero workshops to work on those pesky steps that prevent us from making it through a complete dance. It should be a good review to end the summer season and to be ready for the new dance season in September.
     We are starting new hours in June by starting at 6:30 p.m. instead of 6 p.m. because not enough people are showing up to dance at 6 p.m. So we are hoping the later start will have more people in the hall at the new time to make it worthwhile to the cuer. Marilyn Schmit
