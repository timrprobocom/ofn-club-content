Some have said we&rsquo;re a bunch of crazies,
to dance in temps as hot as Hades.
But so we did the 6th of June,
As Don Wood called a square dance tune
For all the Ramblers, gents and ladies.
 
Our dance&rsquo;s theme was Rainbow Pride,
brilliant hues on many were spied,
purple, indigo, blue, and green,
yellow, orange, and red were seen,
Some were striped, and some tie-dyed.
 
We will be dark until August 1,
while pursuing other types of summer fun.
But on August 1 we&rsquo;ll serve ice cream
And no it isn&rsquo;t just a dream,
Our dance is free to everyone.
 
At 6:30 we will begin our festivities
And for those possessed of such proclivities,
A free intro to dancing at 7:30 starts,
As aspiring dancers learn their parts,
And see why we love square dance activities.
 
We welcome visitors to join our crowd,
We love to dance&mdash;and we&rsquo;re a little loud,
But all are welcome, young and old,
Singles and couples, shy and bold.
Our only rule: no frowns allowed.
 
More prosaically: Our next club dance will take place Saturday, August 1, at the Ankeny Street Studio, 975 SE Sandy Blvd., Portland, Oregon. We will serve ice cream from 6:30 to 7:30; offer a free introduction to square dancing from 7:30 to 8:30; and then dance Mainstream and Plus tips from 8:30 to 9:30. Gary Monday (Seattle) will be calling. All are welcome&mdash;including solos, couples, families, and new and experienced dancers. Find more information on our website: www.rosetownramblers.com. 
 
Happy summer!
 
SYIAS!
