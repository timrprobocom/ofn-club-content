The word got out.  Everyone came to our May dances in casual attire.  By the time that you read this, it will be July and casual dress will be the standard anyway.  While we will go dark July 4, we will welcome you to our annual root beer float dance July 18. 
The new restrooms should be ready by the middle June, so check them out, when you show up for the floats and some great dancing.
