&#8203;On May 9th, Single Trees and Whirl-A-Ways once again combined to celebrate Cinco de Mayo, which is on May 5th and we were late but we celebrated&#8203; &#8203;it anyway.  Everyone had a great time.  On May 22nd, Craig Abercrombie called and cued an excellent dance.

We look forward to Jim Voll's calling and Jackie Gale's cuing on July 10. It'll be our Red, White and Blue Dance.  Lennie Ludiker and Christina Corelli are on tap to call and cue our July 24th Pie and Ice Cream Social.
