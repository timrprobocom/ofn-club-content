May and June definitely demonstrated that Bachelor Beauts are willing to pitch in when needed. Club members served as hosts for the state meeting, helped clean the Pine Forest Grange inside and out, and sold food at the Sisters rodeo. Boy, have we been busy!  But, never too busy to dance! 

In addition to our always fun first and third Saturday dances, we danced to gummy bears and pink cadillacs in a funky town when Denny Lantz called at the Central Oregon Council dance at the end of May. And even though the Knott Landfill facility (aka "the dump") was not in need of our services to help pick up trash on Saturday morning, we held our casual dress Dump Dance that evening. 

June 20 will be our last chance to dance together for a bit because the club is dark in July.
