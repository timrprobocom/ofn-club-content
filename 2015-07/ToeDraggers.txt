Dancing in the rainforest in Madagascar has been something to experience.  We sure do appreciate the folks who decorate for us and turn the Kinton Grange into magical adventures.  Their work has made dancing within our themes more fun.  We had visitations from many clubs in May and June and enjoyed their friendships set to music.
 We are getting closer to our final stop to Japan in Aug. but had to come back to the USA for July and our celebration of America&rsquo;s birthday along with KC&rsquo;s on July 3rd.  We are celebrating with BBQ hotdogs and hamburgers before the dance.  Hope you&rsquo;ll come and join us.  BBQ before the dance starts at 6:30 p.m.
 We will be having a dance the night of July 17th for any folks that might not be able to make it to Summer Festival.  We will have a guest caller and our own Bev Flint cueing.
 In Aug. we are finishing our year&rsquo;s travels with a side trip to Japan and celebrating the Japanese Festival of Aki.  We have had a great tour around the world, thanks to Amanda Roberts our Vice President.  It&rsquo;s been a great year dancing and meeting new friends and reconnecting with friends we haven&rsquo;t seen for a while.
