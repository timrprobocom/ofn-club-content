     Thanks to the planning of Donna Krossman-Darling, we had a wonderful and unique Mystery Trip on May 9, 2015. We all met at a Chinese restaurant in Sandy and got our fill. From there, we traveled out of town to Dodge Park and danced in the grass, ate carrots, kept balloons in the air, and passed wiffle balls, all while dancing to the able calling of mobile caller Scott Zinser. We then moved on and ended up at Paula Zirkle&rsquo;s horse barn. Don Forbes and Paula had set up several games to entertain us and we danced several tips there. We dived into teams of two and played such things as ping pong circulate where we tried to bounce ping pong balls into buckets for points. Of course, we had to pin the tail on the horse and play some horseshoes. We even go to run barrel races and shoot spud guns! Everyone had a wonderful time. The evening was topped off with some homemade ice cream and popcorn. Ron Rasmussen and Patti Smith won first prize as the team with the most points in the games.

     We ended May with a fifth Saturday dance called by Scott Zinser and we all enjoyed strawberry shortcake. The first week in June brought our mainstream class to graduation. We had three students complete the class and are thankful for new members, Jeff and Carolyn. 10 year old Hannah added lots of smiles to our classes, and we hope to see her out dancing.
