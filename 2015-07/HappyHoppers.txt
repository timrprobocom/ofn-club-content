In July and August our club dance schedule goes "dark", allowing the Happy Hoppers to disperse to points unknown, spreading the joy.  We'll start up again in September.

Our weekly square dance lessons are also on summer vacation.  The Happy Hoppers work hard to make our education program a comfortable environment for newcomers.  Lessons will pick up again on Monday, September 21st.  

The highpoint of the summer season, our annual club picnic will take place on Sunday, August 2, at Don and Joanne Oja's farm.
