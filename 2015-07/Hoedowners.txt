May 9th was our Mother&rsquo;s Day Dance.  It was a lovely evening and I spotted a few Mother&rsquo;s aprons dancing on the floor.  We dined on pie, from the traditional to the nouveau recipes we&rsquo;ve all garnered from the internet and TV. Does anyone remember playing the game &ldquo;Mother May I?&rdquo;  Well no one was playing or asking permission, in fact you were encouraged, to take multiple pieces of pie and to taste everything.  
 On May 13th, ten intrepid Hoedowners met for an evening of wine and paint.  Yes, we did mix the two during the evening; beverages in a glass while the paint was blended on a plate.  We will never look at hummingbirds and hibiscus the same.  What a fun party; great company, lots of laughs and we learned a thing or two about painting with acrylics. Every canvas was a work of art, no two the same!
 The 23rd was our annual Red, White and Blue Dance.  Bart and Debra Welch and Mike and Sally Duyck had the Aloha Grange looking spectacular!  It was festive and patriotic, stripes and stars.  I hope you had a chance to join the crowd.
 In July we&rsquo;ll be swaying to tropical breezes on the 11th for our Hawaiian Luau Dance.  Breakout your surf shorts, grass skirts, shells and leis.  Which type of lei do you prefer; tuberose, plumeria, ginger or pikake?  I&rsquo;m a pikake girl myself.  Did you know that all but the plumeria are possible to grow here with extra attention?  
 And on July 25th we&rsquo;re forgetting the yard work, laying back, relaxing and drinking at our Root Beer Float Dance. Please join us.
