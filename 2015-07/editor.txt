Many clubs have gone dark for the summer.  Please make sure that your club information
accurately reflects your dark dances.  Also, summer goes by very quickly, and that's
followed by lessons starting up in the fall.  September lessons will start showing 
up in next month's OFN, so please double-check to make sure your lesson information
is up to date.

I have included an obituary for my father, Norm Roberts, who passed away suddenly
this past Monday.  Norm &amp; Karen started dancing in the Portland area in 1980 and
were active in several clubs over those three decades.
