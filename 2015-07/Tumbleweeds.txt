Goodness, where did May and June go?  Well, on to July!  Let&rsquo;s see what kind of fun we can get into.  I know a lot of you will be going to Summer Festival, but don&rsquo;t have an account of as to how many.

But just a reminder, the Tumbleweeds do not go dark in the summer, except for July 3rd and 17th.  We will go dark so members can be with their families and friends on the 4th, and the hall was previously rented to somebody else on the 17th; otherwise, you can find us dancing every Friday 11 – 2 in our air conditioned hall.  Why not come have lunch with us?  We always look forward to our visitors.

We will have our annual picnic July 11th and will celebrate our 43rd anniversary.  It will be in Stringfield Park, Milwaukie, 10 – 3pm.
