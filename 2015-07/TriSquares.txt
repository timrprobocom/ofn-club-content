We are very excited to announce that we have a new club cuer Sandra Pinion.  Sandra brings a vibrant and exciting energy to the dances.  Thank you for accepting to be a part of Tri-Squares.
 On May 16th we had our annual mystery trip.  Our journey started with groups leaving at individual times.  We made a total of four stops which included a golf course, a ferry ride, a historical center and a stop for dinner.  Terry Halley, our club caller surprised us with square dancing in Canby Park.  We danced under a gazebo!  Our mystery trip ended up at the Country Cut-Ups in Boring, Oregon.  We had a fun filled time and there were five squares.  A big thank you to Gloria and Bob Davis for a great time!
 We will be having one dance during the month of July due to the holiday.  Please join us for our Old McDonald's Berry Bonanza Dance on the 17th.  Our dance will start at 7:30 PM with 15 minutes of pre-rounds and 15 minutes of plus.  At 8PM we will start mainstream with every fourth tip plus.  We will end the dance with light refreshments. 
 See you in a square,
  Leslie Woodland
