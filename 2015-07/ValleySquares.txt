Want to dance off some of those picnic and barbecue calories before the fireworks start?  Join us for our 4th of July Dance at Aloha Grange.  We will be dark July 18 for Summerfest.
 Nine enthusiastic students graduated from mainstream.  We celebrated with a couple of crazy dances - paper plate shuffles and balloons between the knees, as well as cake and ice cream.  Our students got a chance to practice their moves at our June Mainstream Workshop.
 Our Jamboree was well attended and the new TVC and PAC dancers found great deals at our Clothing Resale.
 Ian Craig filled in for Chuck at our May Flowers Dance.  We enjoyed a visitation from Rosetown Ramblers at our Shades of Blue Dance. 
 During our Semi-Annual meeting at the Spaghetti Factory, we filled positions created by our president's resignation.  The new Valley Squares president is Sharon Tefelske and VP is Patt Hawthorne.
