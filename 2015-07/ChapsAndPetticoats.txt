It&rsquo;s been a couple months since the Chaps and Petticoats did a newsletter…time to catch up.  

Our USO/Armed Forces dance on May 15, with Putzler calling and Ken Pratt as Cuer, was our best ever program!  Our Marine, Sandy Shew organized the program to include the Marine Color Guard from Swan Island, a parade of flags, and the Silver Knights and Silver Dragons youth dancers, with Thomas Buchheit calling, showcasing their Canada dance competition squares - congrats on your awards earned!

As if that entertainment wasn&rsquo;t enough; we also had a Silent Auction and donated $71.50 to the USO program that provides safe haven and entertainment to those who serve our country.  SPECIAL THANKS to our VETERANS who honor us with your presence and completed our four squares of dancers. 

Our &ldquo;Lazy Days of Summer&rdquo; dance on June 19, is our last dance before Chaps and Petticoats go dark for the summer.  We want it to end with a bash and we have good talent:  George Hermann, Caller and Molly Combs cues.   Won&rsquo;t you turn out and surprise us??

One-third of the dancers in our club will attend the K-Falls Summer Festival.  For those who stay on the home-front, turn out and help us make our annual fundraiser, a food booth at the Hubbard Hop Festival on July 18th, a success!  We serve Elephant Ears and specialty coffee.  Come, make it a day in the park - bring your folding chairs to view the 10 AM morning parade, satisfy your appetites with a variety of cultural foods, and games (dunk-tank included) for the whole family.  Would be a hoot to see you there!  Oh, also night entertainment is offered in the &ldquo;Beer Gardens&rdquo; in Hubbard, at dark.  

Happy Feet,
Betty Chipps
