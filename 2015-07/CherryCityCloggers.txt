Hello Friends and Dancers,
      We are just now getting back into the click of things and have been busy getting ready for the summer demos. We enjoyed a fun day at Agfest, clogging in the big building and the sound was great. Everyone came over and clapped as we danced. We are now getting ready for Art Festival and World Beat. 
    Our Cherry City Rhythm Rockers have been seen dancing all over. Their next demo is at Marion County Fair and there are some other fun demos on the calendar. 
     We have great instructors for our Cloghoppers seniors. They are looking good and some are even joining the last beginner&rsquo;s class. The beginner&rsquo;s class is quickly catching up with the intermediate class. Everyone is having fun. We are already having a new class dancer&rsquo;s sheet. We have been getting excited for the new coming class in September. Double-toe Stomp Joanie
