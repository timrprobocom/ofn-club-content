May is the month for celebrating Mother&rsquo;s Day, Memorial Day, horse races, and car races by remembering family, friends, and the people who serve and keep us safe.  We thanked our Vets at our Memorial Day Dance.  All of this good weather gave us beautiful flowers to enjoy in our celebrations.
 After putting up with the idiosyncrasies of the Eager Beavers for MANY years, George Clark has announced he is retiring the end of September as our caller.  I think George and Nancy are looking forward to a well deserved rest and time to take a real vacation.  We all wish them the best and look forward to seeing them often as honorees at future dances.  
 Do not forget we invite other dancers to our annual beach trip September 16 - 18 in Garibaldi.  Square dancers have special rates at the Garibaldi Inn.  We have activities planned and there will be plenty of food.  We do like to eat.  For more information on activities and space call Nan at 503-291-1966.
 Members, please sign up to bring a dish to the annual picnic August 13. I was sweetly asked to bring chocolate chip cookies.  It is so nice to be appreciated.
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, Rounds 1:00 - 1:30; Plus 1:30 - 3:15 p.m., at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Portland. This hall is air-conditioned which makes dancing a pleasure during the summer.  Please check for up to date information at www.eagerbeavers.info.
