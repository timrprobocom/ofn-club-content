Spring got off to a great start here in Roseburg as both the Buckeroos and the Timber Eights celebrated their birthdays! First up, the Buckeroos on Saturday night invited Mike Sikorsky in to help celebrate. There were 17 squares out on the floor dancing the night away! Visitors came from all over Oregon to help us celebrate. 
The next afternoon, The Crew came down from the Portland area to help the Timber Eights  celebrate.  They called a great afternoon dance and we all had a fantastic time.
We are gearing up for our annual Buckeroo Round-Up in June. Mark your calendar now and plan to spend three wonderful days dancing here in the Umpqua Valley! 

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
