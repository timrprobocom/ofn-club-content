CCC started another beginning lessons class on February 21 with nine participants.  The middle of March we received some very disheartening news from our instructor of many years, Cheri Posedale. Because of some health issues, her chiropractor has requested that she stop clogging. Needless to say, that puts us in the position of scrambling to find another instructor. We are not quite sure what this is going to look like at the present so we have been looking at all options. If anyone knows of someone who is interested in instructing a clogging club, please have them contact Georganne Pfnister at 503-393-0138. In the meantime, we are looking at the possibility of advanced club members stepping up to instruct, as well as some other instructors who can't commit long term but are willing to assist.  As a club, we are definitely dedicated to keeping our club active and alive, so we'll do whatever we have to do to make this happen. Georganna Pfnister
