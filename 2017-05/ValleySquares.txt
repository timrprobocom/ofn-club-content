 Please join us for our May Flowers Dance May 6th, with Mark Wheeler calling, and our Dancing Under the Sea (In honor of National Maritime Day) May 14th, with Janienne Alexander calling.  These are the third dances for these two applicants for our club caller.  Connie Clark is our veteran cuer.
 In March members had a chance to hear the third of our caller candidates when Rene Ruud called the Read Across America Dance.  Showing versatile interests, dancers also picked up some reading material in the book exchange.  Renee's third dance is June 17th.  We appreciate feedback from club members and other area dancers to help us make this important decision.  
 Janienne Alexander called the Lucky Leprechaun Dance March 18th.  We were visited by a fun contingent of dancers from Country Cutups.  
 Both of our planned visitations were cancelled in March because we didn't get many takers.
