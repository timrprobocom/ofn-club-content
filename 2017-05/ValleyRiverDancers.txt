Welcome home Mark and Laurel from their Mexican cruise to Cancun; they hadn't been back since their honeymoon many moons ago. Here's to many more memory-making adventures!

Preparations are already underway for our Berry Dance on Friday, June 23. Two berry good national callers are our headliners: Randy "Dibberry" Dibble and Dan "Nordberry" Nordbye.  Save the date!

Our dances have been really fun this winter -- we have enjoyed company from other states and regions. We are only a hop, skip, and jump from I-5. In addition to dancing to Randy and Julie, no one but no one can beat Steve's brownies. Join us!

This is my final club report as secretary. Jan Amerson takes over in May along with our new slate of other officers. Thank you for serving. My last shout out is to my friend Tim Roberts who tolerates my transgressions. Dance on!
