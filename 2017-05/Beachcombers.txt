The Beachcombers are having their 2nd Annual Jamboree Camp Out and Dance Weekend on Memorial Day weekend again this year.  Callers and cuers have a chance to practice and, teach during the day and call and cue at the dance in the evening.  Everyone is invited to join us to dance and have meals together.   We will have flyers distributed this month.
