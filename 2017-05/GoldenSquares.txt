Happy Spring! I hope everyone is enjoying more daylight. I sure am. As for Golden Squares, we just started mainstream lessons on May 1.  As I am writing this before they start, I hope we have a great turn out. If we do, we sure could use some Angels and would love to have you. Our lessons are on Monday nights at 6 p.m. at the Estates Auditorium where on the odd Mondays our dance follows the lessons.  We are looking forward to our Pie Night on Memorial Day. Hope you all are enjoying spring time and hope to see you in a square. Teija
