 The Memorial Service for Genevieve Churchill honored her for many accomplishments in her long life, November 22, 1911 to February 9, 2017.  After working at Meyer and Frank for 21 years, she volunteered at Albertina Kerr becoming their longest serving volunteer, and while doing all that she square and round danced her way around the country, holding multiple official positions in the Federation.  She was a guiding light and all that knew her miss her and her joyful smile.  As part of the service her friends danced a tip on the dais. The minister said that was a first for the Church and felt the Lord was smiling. 
 Important Note: Celebrate Memorial Day May 29th dancing at the Aloha Grange as the Sunset Presbyterian Church will be closed. 
 Do not forget to call your mother or another relative on May 14th.  They will be happy to hear from you.
 Our Plus lessons are continuing with a dedicated group of students who are rapidly becoming proficient in the art of Plus.  Our equally dedicated callers and angels are to be thanked and appreciated for their support in our effort to extend the fun of square dancing. 
 Officers for the coming year have been nominated and after voting in April they will be installed in May.  We owe a vote of thanks to the people who are willing to step in and take on the jobs that make the club function.  If you want to be appreciated then step up and volunteer for an office.  Remember, “Many hands make short work.”
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 to 3:00 pm, at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.
