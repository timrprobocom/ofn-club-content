In the month of May, the United States observes several things. There is National Military Appreciation Month, National Teacher Appreciation Week and Day, Free Comic Book Day, World Naked Gardening Day, National Train Day, Memorial Day and of course the favorite one of us all, Mother’s Day. 

The Oaky Doaks also observe several things in the month of May. 

On Saturday, May 6th, we will be observing the club’s 57th Anniversary with Guest (and former club) Caller George Hermann and Guest Cuer Patty Hermann. There will be a full potluck dinner before the dance starting at 6:00 pm with dessert being served at the break. 

To show our love and appreciation to Mother’s everywhere, on Saturday, May 13th, we will be holding a Pre-Mothers’ Day brunch from 11:00 am to 12:30 pm in the basement of the Oak Grove Community Center. The menu will be - Biscuits & Gravy, Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, muffins, juice, coffee, tea.  Cost is $8.00 - adults, kids under 12 - $5.00, under 6 free. Everyone is welcome to join us in observing our devotion to Mom. Please contact the Oaky Doaks in advance if you plan to attend so we can predict how much food to prepare. 

On May 20th, the third Saturday of the month, the Oaky Doaks will be observing time travel as we go back in time and dance to the sounds of Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Louie Armstrong, Artie Shaw, Count Basie and other famous bands of the Big Band Era. So join us as we get “In the Mood” to take a “Sentimental Journey” on the Chattanooga Choo Choo with Caller Mike Halley and Cuer Helen Halley.

Please note that not only have the Oaky Doaks changed their dance time this year but starting in May the admission to our dances has changed to $6.00 per person. We hope that this won’t prevent anyone from joining us. 

Hope to see you across the square soon.
