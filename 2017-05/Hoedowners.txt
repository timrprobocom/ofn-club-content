It was a quick “March” through last month.  Was it the endless rain that made each day melt into the next?  All the inclement weather just made getting out and dancing all the more fun and actually necessary for one’s mental health.  On March 11th we held our Potato Head Dance.  Thanks to the B&B’s for their square that attended and we all dined on our baked potato bar.
 On the 25th was our Spring Fling Dance.   Once again Mother Nature disappointed with uncharacteristically cool temps but no rain.  It was up to the dancers on the floor to celebrate the “hope” of spring and they did just that.  
 What’s UP next?  On May 13th we’re holding our Hippy Dance.  You remember don’t you?   If you don’t, ask a teenager.  They have hippy themed dances of their own and have definite ideas what to wear.
 May 27th is our annual Red, White and Blue Dance in honor of Memorial Day and our military.  Please join us.
