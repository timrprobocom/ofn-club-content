Spring is definitely here; and I, for one, am already tired of the rain. Looking forward to sunny days soon.

Charlie’s classes are going steady. We have a small beginner’s class; but those that are coming are having a great time.

Our September class graduated and are continuing with workshops to improve their skills.

Our A1 class finished and they are now workshopping and have also started learning A2 calls as well. We are all having fun and it’s one of our bigger classes.

We were dark on April 1st to enjoy the Roseburg Birthday Bash with Mike Sikorsky & The Crew. Those that went had a great time.

April 15th brought Steve & Valerie Murphy over from Klamath Falls for our Earth/Day Recycle dance. Almost 3 squares enjoyed Steve’s cueing and Ray putting a twist on the “recycle” call. Fun was had by all.

May 6th will be our “Ole’” dance with Mary Nutt cueing and Ray calling.  Will be fun to continue the Cinco de Mayo celebration.

May 20th is our “Garden Party” Plus dance with Steve Murphy cueing & Ray calling.

The following weekend May 26-28th is the Boatnik Square Dance Festival and promises to be an absolutely wonderful time. Ribbon prices go up on May 1st; so why not take advantage of a reduced rate of $40. You can purchase ribbons online or send in your registration or buy a ribbon at dances.  Hunter Keller & Randy Lewis are the featured talent, and you don’t want to miss it!!  The committee is hard at work to make this a great time for all.
