Our dances at Gleneden Beach on March 10 and 11 were a lot of fun, and we were delighted to have several guests join in the weekend activities, including a potluck on Saturday. On Sunday morning the sun came out and we were treated to a calm, warm day at the coast! 

 Looking ahead to May, we have two dances coming up. It looks like our newest dancers are getting some floor time, both at "home" and away, and we're thankful for the energy and enthusiasm they bring! Karen
