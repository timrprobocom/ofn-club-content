As I write this, we have had 2 dry days in a row so there is hope yet that spring is on the way. We had elections in April and our 59th anniversary dance with KC Curtis and Roger Putzler. We also had guest cuer Patty Herman. Our new officers are President: Frank and Sharon Carter, vice president: Dennis and Julie Woods, secretary: Carol Zelmer, Treasurer: Bruce Prenzgruber. I want to say thank you in advance for your service to the club.

The theme dances that are coming up are: 5/20 George Strait / Western theme and 1/6 / 3 red, white and blue. The dance on 6/3 will be our final dance of the season. If it is hot we may try to dance outside in the shade behind the Grange.

Our caller, KC Curtis will be doing square dance lessons at Lakeshore Athletic Club in Vancouver on Fridays in August at 11 a.m. You do not need to be a member at Lake shore to Angel or take lessons.

Our next club meeting is Monday May 8th at the peach tree in Hazel Dell. 6:30 to eat and 7:30 to meet.  

Respectfully,  Debbie Broers.
