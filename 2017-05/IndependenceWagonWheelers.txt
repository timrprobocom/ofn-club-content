April was a busy month for the members of Independence Wagon Wheelers. We graduated all 13 members of our square dance class and all of them joined the club.  We are so happy to have our new members dancing with us because they really add to the club.
The day after our 57th Birthday Dance, we had our annual club meeting. This is the one time of the year when all members of the club can make motions and vote on any topic that comes up. We elected our new officers for next year (they take over on the 1st of May). Next year’s officers are:  President, LaVerne Bennett, Vice President, Lee Ashwill, Secretary, Tim Hagey, Treasurer, Jim O’Brien, Membership, Ronda Whaley, Co=Membership, Dave O’Neill, Area Delegate, Neta Minten and Historian, Marilyn Schmit.  We wish them all a successful year. Happy Dancing. Linda Neuschwander
