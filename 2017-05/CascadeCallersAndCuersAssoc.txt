Our Fifth Saturday dance for April 29 has morphed into the Area Benefit Dance.  The teen group from Silverton is the beneficiary.  The teens are going to the annual Pacific Northwest Teen Competition.  The competition can be quite spendy with travel, accommodations, food, etc.  We are thinking this is the perfect way to use some of the money we all inherited earlier.  Teens are the best way to promote square and round dancing.  CCCA callers and cuers are on hand to call and cue a fun dance for all. 7:30 pm Pre-Rounds with squares at 8:00 pm.  Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.  You are all invited to benefit the teens.  Thank you.
    Our next scheduled dance is July 29. We have air conditioning in addition to the cushioned wood floors.  Put this date on your calendar and come and be cool with CCCA!

 
Keep on dancin!
