Before we started Mix'n Mingles more than 32 years ago there was nowhere for singles to dance as Singles On Saturdays, nor was there anywhere for singles to dance plus as singles, and there were no plus clubs on west side.
 Single dancers gathered, mostly from Fun Lovers and Circul-8n-Singles, and formed the club.  We asked Bill Helms, the Fun Lovers caller, to call for us, Lindie came up with our name, and things were underway.  Wanting to be inclusive, we formed as an individuals club, with everyone welcome.  A number of us could dance either position so everyone could dance. 
 There are still four of the original club members who have maintained our membership.  At our last dance a couple we hadn't seen on a dance floor for many years showed up at our dance.  They had taken some refresher lessons and came to join us.  Some of us knew them from long ago and some hadn't met them before.  It was a joy to have Karen and Jim on the floor with us again.
