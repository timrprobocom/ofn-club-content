    Our annual special spring dance is Sunday, April 30 with Ian Craig.  3 - 4:30 is advanced followed by our famous potluck.  5:30 - 8:00 is mainstream and plus.  Something for everyone.  Come and join us in Springfield.

 
    We dance every Sunday from 5:30 - 8:00 with Tim Matteson calling all levels.  Cushioned wood floor.  One of our former members, Miyoko McDonald, has come back to dancing as we use the central overhead speaker, and she can hear it.  Miyoko is now deaf in one ear, but with the speaker overhead she can hear.  Yippee!  What a blessing!

 
 Happy dancing
Christina Corelli, Member-At-Large
