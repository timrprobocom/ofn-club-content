Our May dances are:
• The Saturday dances of are May are 6th and 20th and the theme is “Salute the Armed Forces” for our freedoms and our leadership of the world toward peace and cooperation between nations.
• Our dance times are now 7:00 to 7:30 Intermediate Rounds, 7:30 to 9:30 Mainstream dance, with Mike Stout calling and Ken Pratt cueing.
• Our Promenaders Plus dances are on May 4th and May 18th, come and enjoy Darrell Kalmbach’s Plus calling and Ken Pratt’s cueing.
 If parking on the street is full, you can park in the lot at the Premier Community Bank just across the street.
 Our lessons are coming along well and we have a great group of students; that makes it fun for the “Angles”, too.  We will finish the classes by the end of May and have a nice bunch of new dancers to dance with; at ours and at other clubs, too.  Mike is working hard, so are the students, and they are enjoying it too.
