The HAPPY HOPPERS will host our regular first and third Saturday dances at the Clark County Square Dance Center.  The May 6 dance will be our club's 58th anniversary dance with the theme of "Fiesta de la Nocha".  Â¡Ay caramba!  Guest caller will be Darrell Kalmbach, with Tami Helms cueing.  As part of our on-going effort to accommodate Mainstream dancers, this special dance will feature Mainstream calling on every third tip.  On May 20, we'll have a regular dance with Jim Hattrick calling and cueing.

On Sunday afternoon, May 21, our president, Melissa James, will be hosting a celebration dance in honor of her being cancer-free for 10 years.  It's a benefit dance for the Kearney Breast Cancer Center.  Please join us in celebrating Melissa's milestone and in supporting a very worthy cause, at the Hazel Dell Grange.  Jim Hattrick will be calling and cueing.

Our lessons are "dark" for the summer season, to resume in September.
