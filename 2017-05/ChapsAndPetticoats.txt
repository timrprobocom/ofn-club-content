We seem to be having an abundance of April showers, let's certainly hope all this wet and windy leads to May flowers and fun-in-the-sun times.

While you are contemplating the tail-end of April, don't forget to join the Tualatin Timber Squares on Wednesday, April 26th at the Winona Grange and celebrate their "First' Anniversary.  How often can you do that...watch a club take its first year steps?  They are going BIG and calling this their TRIFECTA Dance ... why?  Not only is it their Anniversary, they are giving away the Trophy to the (Tri-Council) Club with the greatest percentage of their membership in attendance AND the dance is open to B-51 "new dancers" (since the snow and icy winter closed their New-Dancer dance).  Janienne Alexander will be your Caller.

Think about your Mother on May 14th and decide to surprise her with a hanging flower basket (or) a trip to your local Fruit & Shrub shop for a flower choice (or) hey, "we're taking you to Sunday brunch." 

On May 20th is also "Armed Forces Day," so remember to show appreciation to one who has served/armed their life to protect yours.  We, the Chaps and Petticoats, will celebrate Armed Forces Day on MAY 19th - with Roger Putzler calling and Ken Pratt cueing.  Sandy Shew, our member veteran, will present an entertaining program and our break will include a march/parade of service-flags. Come join us with Rounds at 7:30pm and Mainstream begins 8:00pm.  We break at 10:00pm for potluck and Bruce Stahlecker, Sheriff, will share his words of wisdom.

See you in a square!
