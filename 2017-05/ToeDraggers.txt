Hope you have been dancing away all of your energy in our wonderful spring weather.  The Toes had a busy month of March with our regular dance and the Luck of the Irish Dance.  Thanks KC and Sandra Pinion.  There even was a Leprechaun giving out Irish kisses.  It was a fun evening for all. 
 We do miss Harlan and Bev Flint recovering from their health issues.  We are wishing you both smooth and thorough recoveries.
 April 7th was our Easter Bonnet Dance.  We always look forward to special costumes and Bill Hults always comes up with the best hats.  Thanks KC and Linda for fun calling and Julie Stout, stepping in to cue for Bev.  You all are appreciated.  April 21st is our silly but fun Ducky Dance.  It brings out the best in us for a good time.  Molly Combs will be cueing for Bev.  Thanks Molly.   Come and visit and join in with us to have a ducky good time.
 Our Mystery Trip is April 22nd and KC and Linda are planning a relaxing and fun day for us.  We are always tired after one of these but bring back such wonderful memories.  We have decided to go to the beach for our campout this year.  It will be in late August.    
 May 5th we are looking forward to our Cinco de Mayo Dance and hope youâ€™ll come and join us at the Kinton Grange.  We will follow up with our regular dance on May 19th.  We love having visitors so come on down and join us for 2 evenings of great folks, music and making new memories all together out in a square at the Kinton Grange.
