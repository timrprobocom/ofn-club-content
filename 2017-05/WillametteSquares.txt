Willamette Squares enjoyed hosting their March dance Eggstravaganza. Besides all the wonderful dancing, there was an egg hunt where prize filled plastic eggs were hidden throughout the square dance center for dancers to discover. (I, for one, know that the Easter bunny made a special sneak appearance when no one was looking to hide the eggs.) There was the usual array of foods at the buffet table, and a specially made punch containing raspberry sherbet that was cool and refreshing. Thanks to Sandy and Jackie for calling and cueing, to Nancy and Brice who made sure there were plenty of refreshments, Shari for the Easter egg hunt, the many hands that helped out where needed, and all who turned out to dance. It was an enthusiastic and energetic crowd! 

Stay tuned for the Willamette Squares regular dance in May on the fourth Saturday for dancing around the maypole. Brice and Nancy continue doing an excellent job managing the current round dance lessons on Sunday evenings. The waltz lessons taught by Ralph and Marilyn are going great! 

Despite declining health problems for some of its members, Willamette Squares is forging ahead. A club meeting is scheduled to determine our next new dancers' dance, and we are looking forward to a spring season full of dancing and camaraderie. Won't you please join us? Jodee Howard
