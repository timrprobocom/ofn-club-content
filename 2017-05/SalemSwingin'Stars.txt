Spring has finally Sprung!!  Thank the Good Lord!! Our March dances were a great hit.  Thanks to all who came out to make the Hobo Dance and the St. Patrick's Day dance a huge success. There was lots of "wearing of the green" for the St. Patrickâ€™s dance. The Plus dance on March 31 had four squares for the Advanced level and over five for the Plus. It was a great turnout and a fun dance.

April brought us our 51st Birthday dance on April 21 and elections of club officers.  Stay tuned for the results. 

May 5 will be a Cinco de Mayo theme and May 19 will be a Regular Dance. June has three Fridays so we will dance three times. The 5th Friday will be a Plus Dance on June 30.

Just a reminder:  WE DANCE ALL YEAR.  Our hall is air conditioned so please come and join us through the summer months. See you all on the Dance Floor. Sheila Machado
