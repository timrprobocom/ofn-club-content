<p>As this article goes to print, the state meeting is still two weeks away. The ballots for voting for the Federation officers for 2017-2018 will be opened then. I am hoping that no matter who wins the contested positions, you will support them in their endeavors to represent you, the dancers, as they assist in carrying on the business of the Federation.</p>
<p>May also brings almost the close to the dance season and many clubs go dark for the summer. If your club does dance during the summer, remember to invite the clubs who go dark in your area to come and dance at your location. They will appreciate the floor time and possibly meet new friends and keep active. We don&rsquo;t want to lose any more dancers.</p>
<p>There are dance weekends, festivals, national convention, and several different seminars in the upcoming months to pick from, to extend your knowledge in many areas of dance. Leadership, Roundalab, Choreographed Ballroom, just to name a few. You are welcome to register and attend any of these. If you need help in locating any of these, let me know. I will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>It will be time to sign up for State Fair in the upcoming months also. I have made contact with them and let them know we would like to dance again this year. I have asked for a Saturday for the youth, Labor Day for those who work so they can attend and a day for Round Dance. Plus one other day for anyone who might be able to attend.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more details as they get back with me with dates and times. Late June or early July. Mark your calendars to get back to me to see if I know anything further.</p>
<p>See you in my travels as I work on getting the last six councils visited before or by September.</p>
