Our Cha class has learned the phase 3 parts of cha and will start the phase 4 parts of cha for April. We have a good class and it is fun to have them around and dance with them.

We are in the process of getting dues paid and voting for Federation officers all to be completed by May 1. The thought process for fall is stewing in the minds of our members and our cuer. Trying to figure out what we want to teach for the fall.

Our cuer has given us the dates that she will be absent for the rest of the year and our Vice President, Richard Smith, is busy contracting guest cuers for those dates. Jeanine Norden will fill two of those. Summer Festival Trails End dance and Thanksgiving will take up two more, so he has two more to fill. He does a good job. 

Come and join us for a relaxing evening of dancing and learning a few new moves in various dances. Marilyn Schmit
