Our 56th Anniversary Dance was a ball! We had guests from Sunset Promenaders, Floor Dusters, Independence Wagon Wheelers and some independents. The Wagon Wheelers brought a square and took home the banner our club had just won from them the Saturday before! We had three squares of dancers and more visiting on the benches. Refreshments included birthday cake, ice cream and we all had a wonderful time! Carmen
