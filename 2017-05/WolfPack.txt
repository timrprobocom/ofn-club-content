Our Bunny Hop dance on April 1st was a lot of fun in spite of a low attendance due to some competition from the Oregon Ducks playing North Carolina.

Lessons continue to go well with a new class that started on April 18th.

Our next dance is May 6th when we will be helping our friends, the Boots and Sandals celebrate their 64th birthday. Lennie Ludiker will be calling this dance. Come and join us for the celebration.

Looking ahead to June, we will be having a B51/Mainstream dance. Bring your new dancers to this one.
