Thank you to everyone who attended our fundraiser dance for the Silver Knights. We really enjoyed dancing to Leonard and Frances. Our cash raffle winners of $100 were: Terry Halley, Scott Zinser and Mario Gonzales.

We are in Langley British Columbia May 5-7. Here's hoping that we bring back some trophies!! See you in a square soon. Petrina Buchheit
