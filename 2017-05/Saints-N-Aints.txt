We started a new beginnerâ€™s class in March.  It is a small class but very enthusiastic. They will be graduating at the end of May.

The church has need of our hall on the first Saturday in May so we will be dark that night.  Since our third Saturday that month dance falls on Armed Forces Day our theme will be Salute to the Troops.
