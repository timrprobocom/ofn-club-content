April dances got into full swing with our first dance on April Foolâ€™s Day. Our dance on April 15 is scheduled with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  Always lots of fun!  Our club is planning a raid on April 8. Then our Mystery Trip is scheduled for April 29th. Yes, it's a secret.  
 
It is that time of year when we are preparing for our BIG STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL the first weekend of June. We have a Silent Auction, dancing on Friday and Saturday nights, potlucks, parade on Saturday morning, and breakfast on Sunday morning. So make your plans to bring your RV for the weekend or just come for any event. We'd love to see you there. Marilyn York
