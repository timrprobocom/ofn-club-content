Greetings from the Buzzin Bees. We are hard at work in preparation for our 57th anniversary dance on April 18th.  The theme is "Honey Time " and we have been on the lookout for bee themed door prizes and have a good selection. Pre rounds start at 7:30 with rounds at 8pm.

After the anniversary dance,  we only have 3 more dances before our season is done.  Our final dance is on June 6th and we always celebrate with a BBQ. We will eat at 6 pm and start dancing at 7:30. All are invited to come and share a meal with us.

We are planning an exhibition dance at Mallard Landing on 4/25 at 2pm. The club will go out for pizza after the dance. We are also planning to visit the Silver Stars that evening  to Celebrate their anniversary. 

Hope to see you in a square.
