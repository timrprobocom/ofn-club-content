Silver Stars have Chuck Garner calling on May 9 and Darrell Kalmbach calling on May 23 with Dorothy Lowder cueing both dances.  We will be dark July and August with our regular dance schedule beginning again in September.  Our club celebrated our 35th anniversary on April 25 with a dance where past members were invited to celebrate with us.  We are also in the process of selecting new officers for the coming year.
