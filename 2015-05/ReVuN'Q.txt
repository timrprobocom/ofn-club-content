	 ReVuNQ is at a pivotal point in its history as we hire a cuer to replace Ray Walz. How do you replace a precious gem of a person? Cheryl Manley and her husband, Geof, have been hired to be the club cuer. She will start full time after she gives 30 day notice to her current location where she is teaching. The finer points of the contract are still being worked out but we are hoping for the best. Stay tuned for more details.
	The club elected new and some returning officers and cast a vote for Federation officers.
	Please put June 18 on the calendar for our 39th birthday dance and recognition/retirement dance for Ray Walz. It is time to honor his time and efforts in keeping us on the dance floor looking good and having fun. Marilyn Schmit
