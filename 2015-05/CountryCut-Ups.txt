One of the great things about spring is driving to dances in the daylight! The beautiful flowers and lengthening days always seem to bring hope. As the trees green up and the strawberries bloom, so our mainstream student move forward toward graduating at the end of May. It is always fun to see the excitement and enthusiasm of new dancers. One of the saddest sights for me is to see people who have grown bored with dancing, but keep doing it. Some look as if it is a chore! Keep a smile on your face, and remember that this is a fun activity. New graduates also remind us of that feeling when it was all new and exciting.

We had a great visitation to the Columbia River Dancers in March 14, 2015, with nearly two squares showing up. They are a new club and did not have any banners yet, so we got one of caller Richard Lane's shirts, including a name tag. Apparently the tradition is that you get the shirt off the back of the caller if they don't have banners to give away. Richard and the Columbia River Dancers can come and reclaim it, if it doesn't get sold in our annual Barn Sale. Everyone had a fun evening.

Remember the Cut-Ups dance at the Boring Barn on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Saturdays of the month, starting at 7:00 PM. May has a 5th Saturday, so we hope to see many of you coming out to spend a fun evening of dancing with us. We dance all summer long!
