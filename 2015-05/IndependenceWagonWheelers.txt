	IWW held their 55th Birthday Dance on Sunday, March 15.  We had over 7 squares dancing!  One hour before the dance started, we lost all power to our dance venue due to high winds.  We thought we would have to cancel this anticipated dance, but just 10 minutes before it was to start, the power came back on! Much excitement and noise was heard all over. Lots of fun was had from the calling of our Guest Callers, Darrell Kalmbach and KC Curtis,  along with our special club caller George Hermann. Guest Cuer; Ken Pratt, and our fabulous club cuer, Ralph Lambert,  made everyone look elegant out on the dance floor. A special thank you goes out to all the callers and curers, along with the many visiting clubs, for coming to support our 55th Birthday. It was truly a very festive birthday celebration. 
	Our April 11 dance is scheduled to have National Caller, Dan Nordbye as our Guest caller for that evening. There will be more information on that next month.  We are looking forward to seeing you in a square. Joni O’Brien
