     We have a new Board.  We thank our out-going Board for their commitment and service to our club last year.  Thank you to Connie Seamans, President; Randy Graboyes, Vice President; Chuck Root, Treasurer and Pat Preston, Secretary.  Our new Board members are: Randy Graboyes, President; Janet Geiger, Vice President; Sharon Greenman, Treasurer and Pat Preston, Secretary.  We look forward to a new dance year starting this fall. &#8203;
     We are 'dark' on May 19 as the cloggers have their convention at the hall in Springfield.  We wish the cloggers a fun-filled weekend.
     We are 'dark' in July as that is a busy month with 4th of July festivities, Summer Festival and the Diamond Lake Festival.
     We encourage our dancers and all dancers to attend the Summer Festival in Klamath Falls, July 16-19.  There are particulars and details you can find 'online.'  Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli are calling and cuing the Trail's End Dance, Thursday, July 16.  Several Oregon callers and cuers are lined up for your dancing pleasure.  The featured caller and cuer are Scott and Erin Byars of Sacramento, California.  Scott called the Thursday night dance at this year's Mid-Winter Festival and was a big hit.
     We enjoyed having national caller, Dan Nordbye, here with us on April 14th.  He's a wonderful caller and interacts with the dancers during the evening and round dances with a lot of the ladies.  He's a real showman.
     Please join us the first and third Saturdays at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.

Keep on dancing.'
