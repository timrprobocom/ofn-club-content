We would like to welcome back Jim Voll as our club caller, since Leonard Snodgrass has resigned.  We will miss Leonard.  We enjoyed his calling, singing, and yodeling, often while joining us on the dance floor.  We appreciated his calling during parades as he walked along, interacting with the crowd and passing out flyers.  He was always encouraging and patient with our new dancers.  Thank you, Leonard.
     On March 14th, we joined the rest of the world and celebrated Pi.  We had a lively dance and delicious pie!  On April 11th, we will hold our Gospel Dance with Jim Voll and Jackie Gale.  Then, on April 24-26, we will have our annual campout at Camp Koinonia, here in Sweet Home.
     Our Wild Wild West BBQ and dance will be held on May 9th.  The dance is casual, and the BBQ will be served before the dance, approximately 6:45pm.  Come Join us for hamburgers and all the fixin's
