 We are very happy to see the graduation of our Mainstream students.  We have a very nice group of dancers this year; hope they will be regular dancers for our club.  They are the future of square dancing.  
 Both of our March dances were fun, exciting, and well attended.  Our Club Caller Mike Stout and our club Cuer Ken Pratt are doing a great job. 
 Also our Plus dances on 1st and 3rd Thursdays are growing with over five squares at the last few dances.  Darrell Kalmbach is our Caller and Ken Pratt is the Cuer.  Darrell is doing an active Plus dance and mixing in some teaching too.  Come check it out, it is fun.
 Our Club went dark and visited the Valley Squares on April 4th.
 May 2nd, our 1st Saturday mainstream dance, will feature guest caller Darrell Kalmbach and Ken Pratt cueing.  
 May 16th, Saturday "Arm Forces Dance" will also have Darrell guest calling and Ken cueing.  Please come join us at Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall; 3rd and Main St.
