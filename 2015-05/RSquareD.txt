 The R Square D came together in a celebration of our new dancers with a B-51 dance on March 13th.  Richard Lane our Guest caller did a fantastic job of keeping the floor moving with a little humor thrown in.  We had a great time kicking it up with visitations from Cougar Squares, Ruff and Ruffles, Happy Hoppers, Hay Shakers, and Columbia River Dancers who took one of our banners home with them. 
 Steve Noseck has been stepping in to teach lessons in March while our baseball loving caller Craig Abercrombie is attending Spring Training in Arizona.  Many Thanks to Steve for traveling our way; we have enjoyed your lessons. 
 On March 28th we are looking forward to an Elvis Tribute with Scott Coons followed by a 50s-60s dance, lots of rolled up sleeves and poodle dancing skirts.
 Our monthly meeting was hosted by John and Chris Poole.
 Friday, May 8th we will have our Fiesta de Mayo Dance and will be dark on the 23rd in observance of Memorial Day.
 On Saturday, May 30th we will be hosting the Sou'Wester Council Dance featuring Richard Lane and Susan Healea.  It will be held at the Kelso Senior Center from 7 to 10 PM.  The first hour is Plus/A2 with intermediate rounds followed by a mainstream dance.  Meet us at Izzy's for dinner at 5PM.
