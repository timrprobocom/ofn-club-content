 March was a busy month for the Toes.  We danced through a tour of Ireland with fun, food and Yellow Rubber Ducks.  We followed KC to the Wagon Wheelers Anniversary Dance on March 15th, as he was a guest caller.  Our newly elected officers are getting ready for their change over for next year.
 Many club members went, in support Loretta and Harlan Flint and their families, to a service held at the Kinton Grange for the passing of their brother Bryom.  The Flint family has been such an important part of the Toe's family. 
 We are traveling through the Scandinavian countries in April.  Love those lederhosen and knee high socks, Harlan.  Our second dance was held at the Odd Fellows Hall in Hillsboro, with good friends and great food as always.
 May brings us to Mexico with a flair, and we will be back to dance at the Kinton Grange.  We are looking forward to the May 30th TVC Dance where each of us, if we wish, can help with a donation for the Hattrick's medical bills that are mounting.
 Our Mystery Trip has been changed to June 6th.  We are looking forward to a fun time traveling together to ? ? ?. 
 See you in a square.
