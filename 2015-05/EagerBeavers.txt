 Green was the color to wear and Irish the music for dancing on St. Patrick’s Day.  So maybe the colors were green only in our imagination and the Irish may not have recognized some of the music but we all had a wonderful time celebrating the holiday. 
 Fourteen members attended the Hoedowners for a visitation on March 28th.  We expect the Hoedowners to retrieve their banner at our Anniversary Dance. 
 Speaking of wonderful times, our annual beach trip will be September 16th – 18th in Garibaldi.  Square dancers have special rates at the Garibaldi Inn. Other dancers are invited to join us. We have a variety of activities planned and there will be plenty of food.  We do like to eat.  For more information on activities and space call Nan at 503-291-1966.
 Eating?  Yes, thirty one of us went for a Dine Out at the Olive Garden including some members who do not dance any more but wanted to visit.  It was a pleasure to see old friends again.  
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00-3:15 p.m. (rounds from 1 to 1:30) at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW  Cornell Road in Beaverton.  This hall is air-conditioned which makes dancing a pleasure during the summer. *** NOTE CHANGE OF LOCATION: May 25, Memorial Day, we dance at the Aloha Grange which is also air conditioned.
