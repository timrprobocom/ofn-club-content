"We have been elected!"  This was the theme of this year's election. It was a reminder to all of us that the Board of our club facilitates the organization of the club and its activities but the members are the ones leading the direction through our input.  With gratitude we thank our present Board members Angie Clark, President; Keith Miles, Vice-President; Chris Suran, Treasurer; Rosalee Salsbery, Secretary; and Debra and Kelly Dunn, Member-at-Large.  They've been unofficially dubbed 'The Famous Six'.  They will continue facilitating our club until the end of July and then our new Board will take their place.  Welcome Eugene (Bonnie) Ivy as President; Cheryl Hoke, 1st Vice President; Robben Romano, 2nd Vice President; Chris Suran, Treasurer; Rosalee Salsbery, Secretary; Sue and John Maahs, and Jeannette Egan, Members-at-Large. We are excited to continue our growth and progress into the coming year.  

How appropriate that we celebrate our Big Anniversary -- 55 years with a Big Celebration.  May 2, we invite you to join us at our 'Fun in Acapulco' dance with the Elvis tribute artist Scott Coon. A floor show will start the celebrating at 4:30pm followed by a Cinco de Mayo potluck supper and then our regular dance schedule begins with Helen Halley cueing Intermediate Rounds at 7:00 pm; Phase 2 Rounds 7:30 - 8:00 pm; and Scott Coon will call the evening's Mainstream dance until 11:00 pm.  It will be a night to remember!  Thanks for coming and helping us make this a fantastic celebration.
