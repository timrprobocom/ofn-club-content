Delegates from each club in the Mid-Willamette Area are researching square dance information from other states. They will bring back their findings to the next MWA Council meeting and share the results with each other. Hopefully, some new ideas will be found that can help our clubs be more successful at recruiting new dancers, increasing membership, and increasing dance attendance.
