Kris Jensen, national caller from Albuquerque, was in town recently and called for Cast-A-Shadow (Advanced) and for Spin Cycle Squares.  We had guests from other clubs at the Sunday evening dance with Kris.  We all had a great time.  We always do when Kris is here, and Tim, our wonderful caller, gets to dance.
     We encourage dancers of all levels to join us on Sundays from 5:30 to 8pm.  Please call our President, David Lajoie, at (541)520-7311 or our caller, Tim, at (541)988-0399, as we are dark from time to time.  We'd hate to miss you.  We offer a great time to all!
     Happy dancing!
