We’ll have an exciting month for us, starting out with a mystery bus trip May 1st.  Our Director of Activities, May Hem, will be tour director.

On the 13th, we will have our Hobo Dance.

But on the 27th, May Hem has outdone herself again.  She’s booked the legendary JIM STEELE to call our dance.  Long-term dancers will remember him calling even when he was a teen ager.  Even today, after much illness, many still regard him as a national quality caller.  He was quite the hit at last year’s Juniper Jubilee festival.  And he’s still one of the fastest callers around.  Check with your cardiologist before you come.  She has paired him with Mark McDonald, a popular cuer from the Prineville area.  But come early, as our parking will fill up fast.

Our new officers:  President, Michael Wagner; V-P, Sue Burns; Secretary, Patricia Neils; Treasurer, Cynthia Ekberg; PAC Delegates, Jim Schira and Mary Theirl.  Supporting them is our usual cast of anonymous helpers, all dedicated to keeping our club a reality.
