It’s certainly said news that the Squaws and Paws are going out of existence.  Gone will be the days of their Potlatch Dance, gathering around the electric bonfire with the buffalo stew and the legends of the Phonee Tribe.  It’s going to take a lot of luck and pluck to keep our clubs going.  

But clubs are a business, and we have to change with the times.  Clubs that can’t will eventually go out of business. One way we can is by thinking progressively, perhaps switching dance nights or even merging with another club wherein talent can be pooled.  It’s always more preferable to merge than to simply go out of business.

Thanks to Tami Helms for volunteering to be our Alternate State Delegate, as well as our council’s Christmas dinner planner.  She’s also our long-time cuer advisor.  Remember, it’s only because people are willing to help that our clubs and councils can exist.

May 30th, our dancers will again have a choice of participating in our Starlight Parade entry or going to a council dance.
