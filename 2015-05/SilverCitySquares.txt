Our youth had a great turnout for their fundraiser dance on March 8. Thank you to everyone who came out and supported the kids. The winners of the raffle were Janienne Alexander, Mark Forster and Jim Elliot, each one winning $100. Our youth are in the last month of practice as we are heading north on May 1!
	Our superstition dance on March 13 was great fun. Some participants even danced under and around the ladder that was in the middle of the hall.
	We hosted a special dance on March 27 to be a surprise destination for a large mystery trip. We had 39 come in on the bus from Lebanon Square Circlers. The Lebanon Square Circlers and Timber Twirlers both stole banners.
	Thomas has passed the club reporter baton on and I will be reporting for the club now. Petrina Buchheit
