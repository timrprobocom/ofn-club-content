Our March 13th dance was a combination dance: a Black Cat dance because it was Friday, the 13th and a St. Patrick's Dance because March 17th was coming up.  Jim Voll called and Christina Corelli cued.
     A good-sized crowd of Buckaroos and others attended our March 27th dance called by Lennie Ludiker and cued by Jackie Gale.  Dale Roberson was our club caller for many years, and he attended, with his wife, Betty.  Great to see them.
     We will join Whirl-A-Ways on Saturday, May 8, to celebrate Cinco de Mayo a couple days late.  The Taco Feed was such a success last year that we are going to do it again.  It will be called by K. C. Curtis and cued by Jackie Gale.  Craig Abercrombie will call and cue our dance on May 22nd.
