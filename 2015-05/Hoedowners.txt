What happened to March?  I swear it was just the end of February and next thing I know I'm being reminded that I need to recap March activities for this publication.  
 The Hoedowner Rock and Roll dance on the 14th was a shout out to the 50's and 60's.  Daryl's music was right in keeping with the theme and most of the dancers could sing right along.  The ballroom was decorated with vinyl 45s, lettermen & biker jackets, malts and reminders of the great top 40 hits we all know and love.
 On March 28th we had our Spring Fling Dance.  There wasn't much flinging going on but plenty of springing!  Spring was only 7 days old but everyone was in a mood to forget winter and celebrate the balmy weather we've been having this year.
 As for May, we're looking forward to our Mother's Day Dance on the 9th.  A variety of pies will be served at break.  On the 23rd, we're holding our Red, White, & Blue Dance.
