By the time you read this, the die might already be cast for the fate of our club.

In 2006 a small group of dedicated dancers revitalized a Recycles club that was going to close its doors.  Over the past 8 1/2 years we have enjoyed many wonderful monthly Plus dances led by our super callers and cuer, Darrell Kalmbach, Jeanine Norden and Scott Zinser.  However, during this time our membership, and our energy, have gradually dwindled to a very low level, and not even our faithful guests are numerous enough to sustain our tiny club.
 
So, our dance this month on Friday, May 8th might very well be our last one.  Come out and help us celebrate our several years of sharing some great dancing times!
