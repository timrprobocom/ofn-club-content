	We are having a great time dancing this year with all of our special theme dances. The last one was a cowboy theme. Our caller Bruce Lowther and his partner Judy Russell came dressed in great western theme outfits and Bruce even had a holster for his cordless mic. How cute. All the music, squares and rounds, kept to the cowboy theme. It was great fun. Several of our guests were also dressed in our theme outfits and that even increased the fun level..
	If you are out Albany way, come and join us for fun dances. You are always welcome at our place.... Sandy Harris
