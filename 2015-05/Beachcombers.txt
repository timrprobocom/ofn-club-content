Beachcombers are dancing from 3-6 pm every 4th Saturday at the Beachcombers Cove just north of Port Orford.  We will have Kippen Parret calling our May dance.  We would like to have everyone join us for our birthday dance on June 27.  KC Curtis will be calling our dance that afternoon with the rounds being cued by our own Cathy Houston.  Come spend some time with us on the South Coast and enjoy some nice beachcombing in addition to dancing with us!
