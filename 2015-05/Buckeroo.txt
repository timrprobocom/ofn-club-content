OOPS!  What can I say? Our March report must have got lost in the shuffle.  We were busy here in Roseburg even if we didn’t have a report. We started the month off with four squares at our March 7th dance. Although our lessons ended in February we have continued to have eight extra weekly workshops for our graduates so they could get more floor time.  The wee little lads from Ireland would have been grinning ear to ear if they had been at our St. Patrick’s Dance and could have joined us at our potato bar.  On the 27th a group of Buckeroos “hit the road” for a visitation to Springfield to retrieve one of our club banners from the Single Trees.  Now that spring is here, we are making our final plans for the June 12, 13, and 14th Buckeroo Round Up.  If you haven’t made plans yet to join us for the week-end, jot us down on your calendar and come and dance with us. The dancing fun begins Friday night, June 12th, and continues Saturday with two workshops during the day, a dance in the evening, and ends Sunday at noon after a pancake breakfast and a morning dance. If your dancing feet are itching for a little more dancing, you can zip on over to Winston after our Round Up ends and dance in the afternoon at the Wildlife Safari Benefit Dance. 

Happy Dancing,
