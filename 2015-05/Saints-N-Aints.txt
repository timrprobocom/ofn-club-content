May 2nd will be our Cinco De Mayo Live Band Dance.  We will also have a taco bar for your eating enjoyment.  Since it is on the first Saturday the dress code will be square dance clothing optional.  So if you want to come to the coast but do not want to bring your square dance attire come on over and enjoy the dancing with us!

Happy Dancing!
