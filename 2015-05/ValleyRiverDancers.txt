    The Valley River Dancers have had a busy spring welcoming a number of new members, holding mainstream and A lessons, visiting other clubs and planning fun dances for you. 
	We are excited to host Canadian caller Steve Edlund at our second Friday plus dance. He will join club caller Randy Dibble and cuer Julie Stiers to add international flare and fun on May 8, with pre-rounds at 7:30.
	Our members have been on the banner prowl recently, recapturing all four of the club's banners and earning a coveted Squaws and Paws banner. Speaking of banners, everyone is invited to our "Come and Get It" mainstream dance on Friday, May 22, where Mid-Willamette clubs will compete for the council's trophy banner. It is sure to be a fun time.  Perrin Damon
