Spring came early to the Willamette Valley and Willamette Squares was inspired to give their March dance the theme of "Spring!" Colorful pots of blooms decorated the Square Dance Center, and there was a definite "spring" in everyone’s' steps as they danced to Sandy Harris's calling and Jackie Gale's cueing. There were guest callers and cuers as well, which added to the existing dances. 
	Willamette Squares invites everyone to come enjoy the Maypole dance at our regularly scheduled dance the end of April. It is fun to rhythmically weave the colorful ribbons around the Maypole. Time spent in the company of Willamette Squares always means enjoyable dancing, shared friendship, and plenty of good food and drink.
