	Club members have been asked to please start thinking about items they can donate to this year's Silent Auction at the Strawberry Festival in June. This is our one and only fundraiser!  Handmade, new, and gently used items are all most welcome! 	
	Please welcome our 2015-2016 Club Officers: Wanda Frenzel, President; Frank Cawrse, Vice President, Barb Schafer, Treasurer; Kaynor Heineck, Secretary; and Doris Nelson,  Area Representative. At the last Club Meeting, it was decided to begin charging $5.00 per dance by the membership, effective immediately. The price will remain $10.00 for a family of three or more and $5.00 for special dances
