April was a busy month for the Ramblers. We held our annual membership meeting on April 4 and are pleased to announce that Jan Thompson is our new President. Jan is an enthusiastic dancer, who has been known to dance six nights a week at venues from Salem to Oregon City to Aloha to Vancouver. And now she's adding round dancing to her repertoire. What a dynamo! We are extremely grateful to "retiring" President Lisa Canavan for her years of dedication to the club and look forward to many more years of dancing with her. We also thank Cindy Carder, who is moving off the Board after seven years as a member-at-large. 

Our First Saturday Dance on April 4 was a huge success. We had a tremendous turnout, supplemented by a visitation from the wonderful folks and fine dancers from the B&Bs. Ian Craig kept us whirling and twirling (and occasionally scratching our heads with his creative use of fractions) all evening.

The Ramblers will be celebrating the graduation of our Mainstream class of 12
marvelous dancers on Saturday, May 2 at the Milwaukie Grange. Chuck Garner
will be calling alternating Mainstream and Plus tips from 7-9:30. We welcome
all dancers --solos, couples, and families. We hope to see you there!

Many Ramblers will be traveling to St. Louis for the IAGSDC convention over Memorial Day weekend. 

We'll be back at the Milwaukie Grange on Saturday, June 6, with Don Wood calling. We will be dark for the month of July.

SYIAS!
