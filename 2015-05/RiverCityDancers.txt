Many thanks to so many dancers for supporting the  fund raiser for our hall, Milwaukie Community Club.  It was  wonderful to see so many members of the Portland Area Council, too.  It was special to also have Mark and Bev Engerman and Janne Norton in attendance.  Eric Foxman was most entertaining with his story telling, as usual.

In June we will celebrate our 25th Anniversary.  More on this next month.

The May PAC dance will be held on May 29.  We are proud to have our caller, Les Seeley and cuer, Tami Helms on stage.  It will be held at Oak Grove Community Center.  See the flyer for details.
