	Braids and Braves are continuing Plus lessons taught by our caller, Leonard Snodgrass, with about a dozen people still in the class. 
	We are looking forward to our Spring club dance on April 18, our Alien Daze Dance on May 16, and our formal Prom dance on June 20. We hope that many of our friends can join us. 
	We're getting pretty excited planning our club campout in August and the various parades and demos for the summer. Jennie Ramer
