 March Merriness at Valley Squares made the last month of winter memorable.  Our dances were well attended, our students moved from B-51 to Mainstream, and danced at their first Jamboree.  We celebrated the Hoedowners' Anniversary Dance with so many wonderful dancing friends.  We gained five new members and one returning member.  Thanks to all the folks from Wagon Wheelers, Rosetown Ramblers, and Hoedowners, who have added such fun and spirit to our dances.
 Please join us for our Saturday dances in May on the 2nd and the 16th.
