	The Floor Duster teen club recently brought 17 dancers to our Monday evening dance. What a great group of young and lively dancers. We certainly enjoyed all their enthusiasm.
	Several clubs attended our March pie night. In fact, we had five squares. As always, we had enough pie left over to share with our Wednesday mainstream class.
	Our Wednesday plus workshop has gone dark to give time for our lessons. We will keep you posted when the workshops restart.  Dolly
