 Our dances are always fun with Randy and Jeanine.  We are enjoying greeting dancers who haven't danced with us before, as well as welcoming back people we haven't seen for a while.  While that isn't newsy, we hope that next month's writing will have something new to share.  Also, we will be listing our special summer dances.
