I appreciate your patience as we get things rolling.  We've corrected
a number of typos in the dance information, and we're starting to get
news, flyers, and photos to come in.
<p>
Remember, if your dance information is incorrect, you can fix that by going 
to the
<a href="/ClubInfo/">state directory club info</a> area.  Use the "Dance" page 
to update your regular dance information, and use the "Edit"  page to edit 
specific dance information and update flyers.
<p>
Please continue to send your club and council news articles to your council's
Area Editor, who will forward them all to me.
<p>
Please be patient as we try to make this a useful resources for dancers 
both within and outside of the Federation.
