	The Silver Stars have  been busy with lessons with a small but energetic group of students.  George Herman is taking them through their paces at a fairly fast rate of speed.  Thanks to our angels for supporting these every week.  
	December brings a very festive season.  We will be having our silent auction dance with Adam Christman doing the calling for us on December 13 with Dorothy Lowder doing the cueing.  Wear your holiday finest and join us.  We will be dancing also on December 27.
