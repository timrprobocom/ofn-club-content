 Valley Squares went dark to celebrate Sunset Promenaders' Anniversary.  Since Chuck was calling, it was a little like being at home.  Ken Pratt cued.  What a nice party the Promenaders hosted!
 Three squares danced to Janet Shannon at our Harvest Dance as Chuck headed south to celebrate his mom's 80th birthday.  Connie cued.  Thanks to all the guests who support us and bring their energy to the floor.  And a special thanks to Hoedowners for not gathering in the sheaves, but for sharing their wonderful decorations with us.
 We continue to have fun while learning at our Mastering Mainstream/Beginning Plus lessons Tuesday nights.
 Please join us at our dances December 6 & 20.  Bring along some cans of food to nourish hungry tummies or toys for dreaming children. 
Our Basics lessons begin January 16, 7 p.m., Aloha Grange.  Please encourage friends and relatives to join us.
