	Thanks to all of you who supported our Annual Pancake Breakfast in October! The Bed and Breakfast tickets were won by square dancers Charlie and Be Lanier. The wood raffle went to a neighbor of the Barn, which made delivery easy. 
	The 3rd Saturday in October saw the Boring Barn filled with 95 dancers! There was a large visitation from the Hoedowners on their Mystery trip, complemented by a visitation from the Bachelors and Bachelorettes. Some of us Cut-Ups have never seen so many squares in the Barn, the long time members said this was a common site 25-30 years ago. Oh, for the good old days!
	The month ended with seven members attending the Seaside Sashay, and then Halloween night several showed up at the PAC 5th Friday dance. It is important to get out and support other events, and invite them to ours.   
	Looking forward, we will have busy time. November has a 5th Saturday and there will be a Pioneer theme dance. Our mainstream lessons have been accelerated to finish by the end of December. December will bring our Christmas party for the club on December 13th. We will end the year with a New Year's Eve dance with a taco bar.
