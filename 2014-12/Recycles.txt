	Quick!  Mark Friday, December 12th on your calendars right away so you don't miss the Recycles' Christmas Plus Dance!  Join us as we celebrate another year of good-fun Plus dancing!   We especially invite newer Plus dancers to come out for the fun---all Plus dancers can enjoy our dances, solos and couples alike.   Santa Scott will call and Mrs. Claus (Jeanine) will guide us with "only suggestions" as we twirl 'Round the floor.   Word has it that Santa's elves will whip up lots of goodies for us to enjoy at break time, too.  Yum!
	Thank you for faithfully continuing to bring in the pull tabs from drink, soup and food cans for our ongoing support of the Ronald McDonald House; the collection jar awaits them on the sign-in table and our donation bags are getting heavy!
Cynthia
