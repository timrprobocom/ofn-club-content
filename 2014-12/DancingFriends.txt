You don't hear much about us but we are still alive and well here in Roseburg.  Dancing Friends is a Round Dance Club and we are excited to be celebrating our 24th birthday December 19th with a combo Birthday and Christmas Round Dance party.  Neil Koozer will be Cueing phase 2, 3, and 4.  (Cost $10.00 per couple).  He has a fabulous list of super pretty Christmas music that he plans to be treating us to.
