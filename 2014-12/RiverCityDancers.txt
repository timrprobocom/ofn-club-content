	River City Dancers are preparing for their traditional holiday activities.  December 6 we will have our Holiday Dinner at Sayler's Country Kitchen.  This is always an enjoyable activity with lots of holiday flair.  A gift exchange is held for those who wish to participate.  Our new dancer class is always invited.
 	This year we will hold a pretend visit to Paris on New Years Eve.  The committee members are well known for their originality.   It promises to be a fun evening. Come join the adventure.
	We are glad this year will be over for our members with aching knees.  Shirley Bristol, Janice Clarke-Reiter, Paula Seeley and Gene Meyer have had replacement surgery and look forward to a pain-free 2015.
	We will see you at Mid-Winter.
