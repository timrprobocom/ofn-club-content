The holidays are just around the corner and Saints-n-Aints are getting ready for them.  We will have a bake sale at our first Saturday dance in November- then a raffle for a turkey on our third Saturday dance.  Both of these are fund raisers for the club.

Class is doing well. We have started inviting them to join us for our regular dances. These dances will be at beginner level so if you have any students that want to up their skills send them over!

Happy Dancing!
