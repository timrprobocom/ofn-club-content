	Silver City Squares hosted their October Fest. -- Dinner and dance on October 10th and our Club was there and took back a banner.  
	A few of us Chaps attended the Seaside Sashay.   Despite the blustery weather, the turnout was great.  Jim Hattrick and Craig Abercrombie gave good harmony to the dance and kept us smiling.  Debbie Taylor, was amazing - a bundle of energy was present in her rounds. Thank you to the Worthington's, Hayshakers and Sunset Promenaders for a well enjoyed event. 
	We welcome all to join the Chaps & Petticoats on December 19th when George Hermann and Sandra Pinion call and cue an evening of all-singing-calls. It is how our club ends the year.
	How unbelievable that this year is almost over!  Have a joy-filled Christmas and a blessed New 2015 Year!
