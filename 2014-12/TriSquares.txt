 We are continuing to audition cuers in our effort to replace Jackie.  New cuers add a touch of excitement to the dance, as each one has special ways of making the dance moves new and fun.  TriSquares dancers will enjoy that until a match is made.
 We have 27 paid-up students learning their mainstream moves, and they look like they are having a good time.  It's a sharp class, and they will be adding a lot to our Club activities in the future.
 We're heading into the Holidays now, and our dance themes will be appropriate to that, but keep in mind that our annual Mardi Gras dance will be coming up in the early spring (I don't know! Are February and March Spring months, or are they still Winter months?), and you don't want to miss that!
