 The Wave Steppers will be dark over the winter-but not too dark.  The square dance class (students and angels) is still meeting Wednesday nights at the Tillamook Elks, though what we're mostly doing is practice and speeding up.  (However, we won't be having class on Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, or December 3, the night of the Master Gardeners annual dinner.)  Round dance (waltz) classes with Connie Clark from Portland are on Sunday afternoons, 3 to 5 p.m. at the Rockaway Beach Community Center; those will continue through December, if the weather holds.
 The 2015 square dance classes will start January 28, with veteran instructor Jim Hattrick conducting the first two lessons, then club caller Joe Wrabek for two lessons, then Hattrick again for two more, and then Joe again.  As last year, the lessons are free-the Tillamook Elks are again letting us use their dance floor free of charge.  The Wave Steppers' regular monthly dances will start again in the spring-again with the goal of having a whole new crew of square dancers able to take the floor by then.
