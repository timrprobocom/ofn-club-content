	"A Night in Venice" will be the theme of our New Years Eve dance this year.  The Front Porch Trio (Jim Hattrick, Craig Abercrombie, and Adam Christman) will do whatever it takes to keep us moving to the music.  Dinner will be included (Italian food!) in this special event.  It is rumored that, in keeping with the theme, a moat will be excavated around the Clark County Square Dance Center and filled with water.  If this plan works out, gondola service, with gondoliers singing operatic arias, would be provided to move our guests from the parking lot to the dance venue.  It should be quite an occasion!!
	We now have a monthly cycle for our Monday evening square dance lessons.  From now until May, we encourage beginning dancers to start introductory lessons on the first Monday of every month at 7:30.  We are committed to serving both beginners and continuing students with this new lesson format, allowing individuals to move up to higher levels at their own speed.  Plus lessons start at 6:30.  Mainstream lessons are available starting at 9:15.  
	As always, we have Plus dances on the first and third Saturdays of the month at the Clark County Square Dance Center.  Pre-rounds start at 7:30, with squares at 8:00.  Jim Hattrick serves as both caller and cuer.
	November 1 was a first Saturday, a regular dance night for us, but we were dark to accommodate the Royal Romp.  So, we seized the rare opportunity to have a visitation with the Buzzin' Bees, at the Hazel Dell Grange Hall.
