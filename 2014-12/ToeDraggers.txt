 Bill and I missed our Howl'N'Along dance and German Dinner due to an emergency family visit to Idaho.  But, we heard that the dinner, German sausage and sauerkraut, with all the trimmings was delicious.  Some came in costumes, which included Red Riding Hood and Big Bad Wolf, a Nun and Frankenstein, a Pirate, and a witch.  Some prizes were awarded for best and creative outfits. 
 On October 26th at Kinton Grange we had the annual Turkey Dinner.  As usual the food and fellowship was outstanding.  Thank you to all those who helped.  The weather also cooperated by stopping the deluge of rain during the hours of the dinner.  Thank you Lord.
 Our December dances will both include a Tour of England with a Boxing Day dance on the 19th.  This will also be our Toy Drive at both dances.
 In January we will tour France with a Topsy Turvy  theme on the 2nd.
 Our Square and Round dance lessons begin on the first Sunday in January.  See January ad for times.
