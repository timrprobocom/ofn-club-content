The bats, ghosts and Happy Halloween banners were packed away by the first of November and the Club was in the swing of November festivities by the first dance in November. In honor of Veterans Day the Veteran's in the Club received a discounted price at one of our November dances and also a discount at lessons the night of November 11th.  
Two plus squares participated in our Veteran's Day parade in Roseburg.  Although it was cold, the sun was shining brightly and there wasn't a rain drop in sight so we all considered the parade a success.  Neil Koozer  donated the use of his pick up again this year and thanks to Doris the truck was decorated in style.  We looked pretty spiffy strutting and dancing down Jackson Street.
Our annual Thanksgiving potluck and dance, which was held the 3rd Saturday in November, honored Don Marshall for his accomplishment of Calling for 25 years.  We had six squares dancing to music from the 70's and 80's. We have been fortunate to have had  Don calling for both our Buckeroo and Timber 8 Clubs for so many years.  Hats off to Don for doing such a fabulous job and not giving up on us or packing up and leaving Douglas County for the bright lights of a big city to live.
The Buckeroos wish all of our Square Dance friends a holly jolly Christmas!
