	One of our greatest finds, by perspective member Linda Tallmon, was the original banner of our club from 1965!  It was found at the estate sale of Joyce Morgan recently.  Joyce was the last of our charter members to resign from the club about eight years ago.
	Like many people in our club, our club has admired the River City Riders at such events as the Seaside Sashay.  I had been told that they require regular feeding and watering like all livestock.  What I wasn't told (until backstage) is that they were actually referring to the riders!  We said our good-by's as the riders headed off to the Seaside afterparty, presumably for bags of oats and water.
