 Our visitation to Tumbleweeds was delicious in more ways than one.   First we managed to retrieve our beloved beaver by bringing a dozen dancers.   But the dancers say the lunch provided by the Tumbleweeds was just as delicious.  Thanks to the Tumbleweeds for their much appreciated hospitality.  Thanks also go to Joyce Hooper cueing and Jim Hattrick calling. 
 The Eager Beavers did a square dance presentation at Prestige Senior Living for a small but appreciative audience. 
 Because of multiple conflicts only nine of us were able to attend the CREW Dance hosted by the Golden Squares at Country Club Estates in Woodburn.   We all really enjoyed dancing to those four great callers. 
 Our Harvest Dance was a mainstream dance for those earning a TVC Ambassador's Badge.  Callers George Clark and Norm Yoder called a great dance, switching from Plus to Mainstream.  Although dancing was enjoyable I think many of us were very excited to see tables set with a mountain of chicken and various delicious side dishes.  And, of course, we all loaded our plates with desserts. 
 Wishing everyone Happy Holidays.  Hope all can celebrate by dancing. 
 All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:15-3:15 p.m., at the Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.  Please check for up to date information at www.eagerbeavers.info.
