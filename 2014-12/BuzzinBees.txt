	Season's greetings from the Buzzin' bees. It is the start of one of the busiest seasons of the year. I urge everyone to take some time to be with friends and family at this time of the year. For some, it is a tough season to get through. 
	October's theme dance " Raining cats and dogs" happened on a dry night but we took in a lot of pet food and supplies that we donated to the Humane Society and a few days after the dance the mega rain started. By the time you read this we will have had our first Elvis dance and we're very much looking forward to our guest caller, Mark Wheeler. We decided to take a different direction with our holiday dance this year. Instead of donating toys for tots we decided to honor our senior citizens and collect donations of toiletries and socks for donation to local assisted living facilities. We have 4 assisted living facilities within 2 miles of the Hazel Dell Grange so we are hoping for a large dance and large donations. I know I will be hitting Fred Meyers "early bird" socks sale on the day after Thanksgiving.
	We will be starting lessons again in January and the date has yet to be determined. We do lessons on Sundays at 6 p.m..
	I want to thank all of our club members for working so hard to keep our club going. We have a good and group of people. I wish you Happy Holidays and a healthy New Year.
