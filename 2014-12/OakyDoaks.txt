	It was a day Winnie the Pooh would have loved!  A blustery Saturday when we headed out on our Mystery Trip.  Were these winds and rains part of the planning?  Square dancing that began under the Spruce Goose and ended with the 'red-headed Sisters' of the Willamette Squares for their Birthday Dance.  Thank you for the warm hospitality and the opportunity to bring the day to a happy conclusion by 'dancing up a storm'.
	Our 'Gospel Christmas Dance' (December 6) will usher in the Holiday Season.  The Square Dancing will start with a mini-teach of a Plus move at 7:50pm.  Look for stocking stuffers, baked goods and small decorations for the table and tree at our Silent Auction. 'Salute to Santa' (December 20) gives us one more chance to dance with playful enthusiasm just before the joyful preparation to Christmas itself.
	Think South! No, even further! South! You're getting warmer. . .  Remember the 'Pearl of the Pacific' . . . Now you're HOT! In late December, we'll be starting the pre-sale of tickets for our 55th Anniversary Dance in May 2015.  The Oaky Doaks will be coming your way (with tickets) in the New Year so you can ensure a fun evening with us next May. Watch for more teasers next month.
