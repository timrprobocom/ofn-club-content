 The Club has decided to start a Thursday night Plus Dance since Norm Yoder has retired after starting and being the caller for his Plus Knights Club for 30 years.  The Sunset Promenaders Club is going to call the dance Plus Promenaders and it will be on the 1st and 3rd Thursday each month with Darrell Kalmbach calling and Ken Pratt cueing Intermediate and Phase 2 Rounds.  We invite all Plus Dancers to come and dance with us at the Hillsboro Odd Fellows Hall, 267 E. Main St.  The times will be 7:00 to 7:30 for Pre-Rounds and 7:30 until 9:30 Plus Dance with a potluck dessert break afterwards.  Come, enjoy yourselves, and visit; nice hall with good wood floor and ample parking on the street or at the Premier Community Bank.
 Our Mainstream dance is on 1st and 3rd Saturdays with Mike Stout and Ken Pratt as our club caller and cuer.  In December we are having a guest caller Darrell Kalmbach calling while Mike is on vacation.  December 6th is a regular Mainstream dance and December 20th is our Christmas Dance with all singing calls.  The times for the dances are 7:00 to 7:30 Intermediate Pre-Rounds; Mainstream Dance from 8:00 to 10:00; with a potluck break afterwards.  Please come and enjoy.
