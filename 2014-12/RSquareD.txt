 Autumn is the Hush before winter.  Here at R Square D we have been anything but hushed this month.  We celebrated Fall with our 3-day Oktoberfest on the first weekend of the month. The club served 93 dancers a good old fashioned German dinner followed up by 12 squares of dancing to the enjoyable calling of Les Seeley and Tami Helms.  We thank the River City Riders for the entertainment on Saturday, a good time was had by all. We appreciate all the hard work that Arlene Evanson has done for so many years to head up this event.
 The second weekend of the month we continued to celebrate with a harvest dance with caller Craig Abercrombie. 
 Dance lessons started on the 15th with 13 new dancers, WOW ! Our monthly meeting was held at Ron and Lynn Waliezer's home with good conversation surrounding this dance we all enjoy. 
 December brings us a B-51 toy dance on the 12th and the 27th is our Christmas dance, Please join us.
