Whirl-A-Ways annual "Friendship Dinner" in late October was attended by 39 who enjoyed great food, a lot of visiting, and fun games.  A special 'Thank You' to Rick and Sharon Stuller for again hosting us in their large RV garage at their home.
On December 13 at our regular dance evening we will again collect gifts and needed items for the children at Jasper Mountain--a local recovery center for abused children from all over the state of Oregon.
Then on Saturday, December 20 we will join with Danebo Circle-8 and Single Trees clubs for a special, big Christmas Dance.
Thus Whirl-A-Ways will go DARK on December 27.
The New Years Eve dance on December 31 will again be hosted by caller, Roger Putzler and his wife Linda, and cuer Christina Corelli and her hubby Kirby Goode, at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield, for a memorable evening of fun dancing with our friends from our area!
Whirl-A-Ways send wishes to everyone for a wonderful Christmas season, and the very best in the New Year.
