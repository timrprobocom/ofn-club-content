 Every December we have our Canned Food Dance, decorating the stage with stacks of cans and other staple foods.  All donations (we take cash, too) will go to the food bank in Tualatin.  It's handy that Winona Grange has a barrel for us to fill and will see that all contributions will go to the intended destination.
