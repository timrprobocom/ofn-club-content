 Well October just blew by like a cool autumn breeze.  Our Harvest Dance was held October 11th.  Corn stalks and hay bales, scarecrows and crates of produce decorated the ballroom.   
 The bounteous harvest theme continued on October 18th for our Mystery Trip.  We boarded the bus and headed north and followed along the Columbia River to the Bridge of the Gods before crossing back into Oregon.  It was a beautiful day which enabled us to enjoy the spectacular scenery of the Gorge.  We stopped in Hood River for the annual Hood River Harvest Festival.  It was a golden afternoon for shopping in the craft booths and who knows how many pounds of apples we bought?  My favorite was Oregon's own Mountain Rose with a pale exterior and deep red flesh within.  We then boarded the bus, headed west to dance with the Country Cutups at the Boring Barn.  What a welcome we received!  Thank you Cutups for a fun evening and the lavish buffet.
 We wrapped up the month on October 25th was our annual Spooky Boogie Dance;  black lights giving the skeletons a creepy glow.
 December will be a busy month as we hold our New Dancer Jamboree on the 7th.  We have an enthusiastic group of new dancers so please bring new and experienced dancers to join us. 
 Our Toyland Dance will be the 13th.  Each year we enjoy the ballroom decorated for us by the Aloha Grange and collect donated toys for the holiday season.  
 Will the holidays leave you ready for a comfy clothes and comfort food?  Then you must join us for our Pajama Party on December 27th.  Flannels, footie's, or sweats, we don't care just join us for a cozy evening of dance and we'll be serving comfort foods at break.
 It's been a busy and fruitful year for the Hoedowners.  We've danced, partied, laughed and worked hard.  We are thankful for the joys of friendship and look forward to 2015.  Wishing you the joys of the season!
