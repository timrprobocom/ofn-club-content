I would like to wish everybody a fun and enjoyable Holiday Season.  Kathy and I have just gotten back from visiting my brother in Florida.  We had a fun time and enjoyed square and round dancing while we were there.
<p>
Prior to our leaving for Florida, Kathy and I, along with our friend Sylvia, went to the Juniper Jubilee in Mitchell.  We then traveled down to the KC Squares Potato Festival in Klamath Falls.  One week later we were at the Seaside Sashay Square Dance Festival in Seaside.  We have found out that every Special Dance or Festival has something .Special. to offer.  When we attended the Central Oregon Round-Up they had a Flash-Mob dance in downtown Sisters.  At the Battle Rock Week-End, we had fun dancing on the beach and in the surf.  In attending the Hahn Barn Dance it was the fabulous picnic and dancing in the loft of the barn.  When we were at the Juniper Jubilee we danced at the Painted Hills Overlook and on Main Street.  We also took 3rd Place in the Spud Gun Shootout.  At the KC Squares Potato Festival we had fun at the Potato Festival Parade.  The Seaside Sashay was great even with dancing at the Turnaround being rained out.  However the weather did not dampen the spirits for participating in the Passport Promenade.

In following my agenda, to encourage attendance at Festivals and Special Dances, I have asked Barbara Wines, Federation Education Chairman, to set up a seminar at the Mid-Winter Festival.  This seminar is to gather and pass along information to clubs and councils on ways to make their dances, special dances, and festivals more Fun and Special.  I would encourage every club and council to have at least one individual attend this seminar and take back helpful information for their club or council.
