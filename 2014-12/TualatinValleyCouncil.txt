 Thirty one round dancers attended the second TVC Round Dance Party on October 31.  Besides being Halloween night, it was the first night of Royal Romp in Vancouver, apparently resulting in half of last year's attendance.  Ken Pratt was the cuer for the evening.
 The next Council event will be our annual New Year's Eve dance, held at the IOOF Hall in Hillsboro.  Scott Zinser is the featured caller with Molly Combs cueing.  This is a ticket sale dance.  They can be purchased in advance through TVC officers, or club delegates at each of the TVC clubs.  There are not too many tickets left, so you need to get yours soon.  The evening will begin with a dinner at 7:30 with Pre-Rounds at 8:30, and Mainstream at 9:00.  Every 3rd tip will be Plus including intermediate rounds.  One tip will be called after midnight. Ticket costs: $13 per person or $25 when two are purchased at the same time.
