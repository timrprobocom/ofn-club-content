We had a great time at Mid-Winter and enjoyed dancing with everyone. Our January dance did have low attendance due to the weather - but those who came had a lot of fun dancing to Leonard Snodgrass and Judy Russell who filled in for Frances because she was iced in at home.

We are starting our practices for competition and working hard. My sister Julia has decided that she wants to try to compete in cueing this year so we will have someone competing in almost every category!!!! We are selling raffle tickets as well as the festival pins - please catch one of us if we don't ask you first. Our fundraiser dance is on Friday, March 24 and mom has promised an overnight youth party after the fundraiser. Please plan to come and help us. Petrina Buchheit
