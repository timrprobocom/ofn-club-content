January 13th brought our Snowfest dance, held at the B51 level for all the dancers to enjoy. In our joint clubs dance lessons, new dancers are getting comfortable at the B51 level, and as they are ready to move on, learning the rest of the mainstream moves following regular lessons. There are now a good number of dancers at the B51 level, so we are hopeful they will eventually complete mainstream and join our clubs. Jim Hattrick did us proud getting our new dancers to have a good time at that level of dancing, and it was interesting how he mixed it up to make the dancing fun for us all.

Our March 10th dance with Jim Hattrick will get a little Irish twist. We will have our baked potato feed at the break with all sorts of yummy goodies to put on the hot potatoes. If you attend, feel free to bring your own favorite toppings. We can never have enough of a good thing. On March 24th, the fourth Friday dance, will feature caller KC Curtis for the evening.
