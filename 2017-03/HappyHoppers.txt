The HAPPY HOPPERS have had a great Winter, but it's time to think about Spring.  The Vernal Equinox happens in March!  The days are getting longer and the gardeners are getting itchy trowel-fingers.  We might not all be "Spring Chickens", but we know a good thing when we see it.

Our teacher, Jim Hattrick, is well known as a premier educator.  Square dance lessons for new beginners will start on Monday, March 6th at the Clark County Square Dance Center.  We work hard to make our education program a comfortable environment for students.  Many of our club members volunteer as "Angels" to help make it an easy and productive experience.  Every Monday, Plus lessons will be given at 6:30, Basic lessons start at 7:30, and Mainstream lessons are available at 9:00.  We are committed to serving both beginners and continuing students with our lesson format.

We will have our regular Plus dances on the first and third Saturdays of the month at the Clark County Square Dance Center, with our club caller/cuer, Jim Hattrick.  For March, it's the 4th and the 18th.  The 4th is our annual "Irish Potato Dance".  Baked potatoes for everybody, with all the toppings!  Pre-rounds start at 7:30, with squares at 8:00.
