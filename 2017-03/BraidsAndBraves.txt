It was great to be back dancing with our great club, especially after missing so many dances due to icy roads! Our New Dancer Dance was well-attended with five squares on the floor and visitors from at least seven local clubs. At least five couples attended Mid-Winter Festival, too. What a great start to a New Year! Carmen Rost
