Lebanon Square Circlers celebrated 68 years of dancing on Sunday, January 15 with a great dance -- even though the weather had been so bad earlier in the week.  Charlotte Jeskey and Jim Voll called and Jackie Gale cued. Of course, we served strawberry shortcake during the break.   

Then many of our members attended the Mid Winter Festival. One of the highlights of the event was the Grand March. Our club was very proud of the four men from the Lebanon American Legion Post 51 who presented the flags and were also members of the Lebanon Square Circlers --John Frenzel, Nick Heineck, Jerry Masog, and Fred Schaefer. During the weekend our club gathered for dinner at Pop's Branding Iron. So much fun!
    
On February 4 our club had its New Dancers Dance which had been postponed due to inclement weather. It was also a â€œFifties" dance and there were lots of poodle skirts.   Great dance!
   
Now our club is electing new officers and getting ready for Strawberry Festival. Please mark your calendar for the first weekend of June and come dance and have fun with us. See you in a square! Marilyn York
