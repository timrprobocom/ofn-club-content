The Valley River Dancers are happily anticipating their 17th birthday dance on Friday, January 24, and hope to share the day with many of our dancing friends. 

Welcome home to our caller Randy Dibble from a gig calling for a Valentine's Day sweetheart dance in San Jose. Color us lucky...their door was $18 while ours is $5 (and no, that didn't include dinner)! 

Our lessons are off to a great start; beginners accepted on the 21st and 28th so tell your friends it's not too late.
