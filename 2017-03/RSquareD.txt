Old man winter hit hard in the Northwest region in the New Year and pretty much put a stop to lessons and our Snow Flake frolic dance on January 13th.  No frolicking to be found as no one could make it to the dance hall safety and it was cancelled.  Many dancers headed to Mid-Winter in Albany and R Square D went dark for the last dance of the month. 
 Lessons continue each week and we have started a second group for this year, really good turnouts for plus, basic and mainstream alike.  Craig Abercrombie is an amazing teacher, he makes learning fun. 
 Thanks go out to Dick and Sandy Sims for hosting our monthly meeting at the Senior Center on the 16th. 
 Hopefully come March, the snow and ice will have settled down so we can all get back to dancing.  We bring in the month with a St. Patrick’s Dance on the 10th.  Come on out and join us with some luck of the Irish, Pot of Gold, Leprechaun magic and music of our guest caller, Adam Christman. 
 March 25th welcomes spring with a Spring Fling dance.  It’s a benefit dance for a local non-profit in the Longview area, The Progress Center.  The Center provides early intervention, education, therapy and prevention to young children birth to age 3 with special developmental needs or with risk of developmental delays.  It’s very exciting to be able to provide to a local non-profit.  Thank You Square Dancers, it’s nice to be able to have fun for a good cause.  
 For more information about us please visit our website at www.r-square-d.info or friend us on Facebook.  Our Caller for R Square D is Craig Abercrombie and our cuer is Lonnie Sycks.
