A special thanks to Connie Seamans and Paul Gates for putting on a great Mid-Winter Festival. Nice to see all our friends who were there.

We celebrated our 19th Birthday with a fun dance on Saturday, February 4th. So nice to see and visit with all the friends who came. Sandy called a great dance, Christina cued, and we even had one tip with Larry calling.

We are going dark in March to allow the Emerald Square Dance Center to rent the Hall to a private party for the day. That means you will have to wait until April to dance with us.

Lessons on Tuesday nights are going well. Bad weather and illness were a problem for a while but it's starting to get back to normal.
