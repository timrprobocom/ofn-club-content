January's weather kept us iced in and dancing in front of fireplaces or heat registers to stay warm.  We had to cancel our 1st Saturday dance and our first set of lessons because of Old Man Winter.  
 Our Celebrate Diversity Dance called by Janienne Alexander and cued by Connie Clark had five squares of folks itching to dance after the hiatus.  Thanks to all of our guests, you brought wonderful energy.  We were particularly impressed with new dancers from Toe Draggers & Rosetown Ramblers. 
Our lessons, taught by Mark Wheeler, started on January 24th.  I arrived late from Jefferson and when I walked in, three squares were dancing. 
 Please attend our March dances on the 1st & 3rd Saturdays.  Also the first Saturday in April is our Anniversary Dance called by Scott Zinser & cued by Connie Clark.
