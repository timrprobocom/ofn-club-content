Each year the Tualatin Valley Council holds a Presidents Appreciation Potluck to recognize current and past club presidents as well as to present a special award to persons who have made significant contributions in our dance community. This "TVC Recognition Award" was presented to Nan Overall.  As a member of the Eager Beavers, Hoedowners, and Sunset Promenaders, Nan has been a loyal member attending all dances, lessons, and club meetings.  She has affectionately earned the nickname of "The Cake Lady".  She was recognized for her commitment to and leadership of the square dance community.  Nan displays a true desire to get people dancing.  Her persistence in rounding up people to complete squares is attested to by all who know her.  With a standing ovation she was presented an engraved plaque and gold bars by Dale Brabham, Council President.
 The next Council event will be "Sunday Afternoon Delight", dance on March 5th at the Sunset Presbyterian Church from 2:00 to 4:30.  Gary Shoemake will be calling and Yvonne Clendenin cueing.  Gary is a popular International Caller and this will be a very special treat for us.  See the flyer below or on the Federation Facebook page.  The Sunset Presbyterian Church is located west of Sunset High School at 14986 NW Cornell Rd Beaverton, OR 97229.  Use the East entrance and parking lot.
