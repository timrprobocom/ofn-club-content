We have a special dance coming up April 30th (a Sunday) with Ian Craig calling.  Ian will call Advanced from 3:00 - 4:30.  We'll have our famous potluck from 4:30 - 5:30 and then Mainstream and Plus at 5:30.  Dance sessions are $7 each. The dance will take place in Hall A , the main hall, at the ESDC in Springfield. Nice cushioned wood floor in both halls. 

We've had a number of opportunities to dance to the fine calling of national caller, Kris Jensen, from Albuquerque.  Kris and Kurt's mom now lives in Eugene, moving up from Medford. 

We are blessed to have our own Tim Matteson who calls and teaches all levels.  We invite all dancers to join us most Sunday evenings from 5:30 - 8:00.  Please call our president, David, to confirm.  541-521-7311

Keep on dancing!
