Greeting from the Buzzin Bees. We hope this finds you doing well and surviving the winter. I didn't get to attend mid-winter this year but I have heard so many positive comments that we want to give kudos to the organizers.

February was a fun month with our pie eating contest. The winner for 2017 is Anthony Egon from the Floor Dusters. We had planned have our new dancer class graduate on February 12th but we had to cancel several classes due to snow, super bowl and midwinter so we are looking towards mid-March.

We have started the search for a new Cuer now that Debbie Combs has retired. We welcome Doug hatch as our cuer on 3/4 and Julie Stiers on 3/18. The theme for our 3/18 dance is "Flying high" and we will decorate with Kites and have Irish Sundays  for the break. Looking ahead to April, we are hot and heavy into the planning mode for our 59th anniversary. We will be celebrating the anniversary at our April 13th dance and Patty Herman will be our cuer. We are excited to have Roger Putzler join K.C. Curtis to do the calling that night. Plan to join us.
