<p>It's time for the election of Federation officers again. &nbsp;Please notice the link in the "Federation Events" section to see a brief biography of the candidates for office. &nbsp;These people have kindly volunteered to give of their time to help keep square dancing alive and vital in our state.</p>
<p>We have an advertisement this month from a woman who is trying to sell a large collection of square dance attire. &nbsp;Be sure to give it a look. &nbsp;Her contact information is embedded.</p>
<p>We also have a wonderful articles on retaining young dancers from the Federation's Youth Activities Coordinator, Karyn Buchheit. &nbsp;This is an important article that deserves to be spread around our community.</p>
<p>I have a question for you all. &nbsp;I'm sure you've all seen the "Special Dances" section below. &nbsp;So far, I have not refused any request to mark a dance as "special", but there's a danger. &nbsp;When every dance is special, then NO dance is special. &nbsp;Is the list getting too long? &nbsp;Do I need to&nbsp;set a quota of so many special dances per year? &nbsp;Or is it working just fine? &nbsp;Your feedback is always welcome.</p>
