Our club had a bountiful turnout for the Mid-Winter Festival in Albany. Some of our nearly graduated mainstream students showed up and got some good floor time. We enjoyed a club dinner at Lum Yuen's Chinese restaurant.

We are planning to start another Mainstream Class March 2nd, on the heels of graduating about a dozen new students at the end of February. We want them to come back as angels and solidify their skills and get a new crop of dancers started. Scott Zinser will be teaching and we will continue to meet on Thursday nights at the Boring Barn from 7:30 to 9:30 PM.

We are gearing up for our Annual Barn Sale on April 7th and 8th. We are accepting donations now. Doing some spring cleaning and donâ€™t want to do a garage sale? Give us a call.

It has been fun visiting clubs who dance on the 3rd Saturday since we changed our schedule. We visited the Happy Hoppers in January, and the Oaky Doaks in February. We will be going to the Valley Squares in Aloha this month. We will be holding elections in March at our General Meeting. This past year has gone by quickly!

Keep on dancing!
