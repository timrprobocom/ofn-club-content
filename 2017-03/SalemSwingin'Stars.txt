What a time we have had!!  Snow, ice and freezing rain.  Dances cancelled.  Hopefully, we are at the end of this nasty weather. In the meantime, we graduated 11 students from our Mainstream class just in time for Mid Winter Festival. Several of them attended and had a blast in the B-51 Hall.
February brought us our regular dances on the first and third Fridays of the month.  We wore RED to raise awareness of Heart Disease in Women on February 3 for National Wear Red Day.  
March is a busy month for us with two theme dances and our 5th Friday Plus Dance on March 31. Join us for a steaming bowl of Hobo Stew on March 3 at our HOBO Dance.  The committee has been extra busy creating cool decorations. On March 17 wear your GREEN to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. Everyone in attendance will receive a special button.
