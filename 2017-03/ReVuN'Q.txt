We survived our Showcase of Rounds at Mid-Winter. Six couples danced as a troupe and had a great time. I personally misbehaved and had a wonderful time and we received comments to reflect the fun we had. 
Now we will spend the spring just doing some dancing and workshopping various trouble spots in dances, dancing to favorites and to the music presented at Mid-Winter by the Parkers. Now we can look forward to Rey and Sherry Garza for Summer Festival in Salem. 
It will soon be time for officer elections and paying dues to the club. We welcome new members any time and will offer opportunities for club members to run for office.
Cheryl has given us some dates that she will be gone for various family events and the ICBDA convention. We will be in the process of finding cuers to fill in for her. Stay tuned to find out who will come to give us a variety of dancing music to get our exercise on. Marilyn Schmit
