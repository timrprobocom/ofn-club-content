As I mentioned in an earlier article, our club works during the Polk County Fair and this provides us with the funds necessary to offer our dance classes throughout the year.  This year we were asked to provide the same service for the Home and Garden Show.  This gave us a second time to earn money to support our classes.  As with the Fair, our club members had a great time with this function also. 
Come and enjoy our Birthday Dance on the 11th of March at the Polk County Fairgrounds.  The club provides cake and ice cream, after all what would a Birthday Party be without cake and ice cream? 
In April we will be having two special dances.  Look for the information and flyers for these dances in the next month issue of the OFN.  We are also planning our annual Koast Krash with the theme of Wizard of Oz.  More information about this function will also be in next monthâ€™s OFN. Happy Dancing. Linda Neuschwander
