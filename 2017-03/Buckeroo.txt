What fun we all had the mid-Winter celebration in Albany! It is always so much fun to catch up with friends from all over the state. The Buckeroos had nearly 40 members travel to Albany for the celebration. We had quite a few who were first timers to the event and who plan to attend for many years to come.
We just graduated 20 new students in mainstream and 17 of them have already joined the club and become official “Buckeroos”! We love the energy and enthusiasm our new members bring to our club. Most of them are already helping out as “angels” at our new lessons which began in January. We currently have 10 new students well on their way to mastering mainstream square dancing!
Every year we honor club members who have gone out of their way to support and encourage the love of square dancing. This year Bruce and Laura Knotts were awarded the “Buckeroo of the Year” plaque.  They have worked hard organizing our lessons and supporting our new dancers! Thanks for all you do, Bruce and Laura!

Happy dancing,
Robin Faltersack
