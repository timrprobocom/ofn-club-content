Our next scheduled dance is April 29 at the dance center in Springfield.  The members of CCCA have a meeting at 6:30 and then we start with Pre-Rounds at 7:30 and the square dance at 8:00.  We have a number of newer cuer and caller members.  We have dances every fifth Saturday so April 29 is the next one to mark on your calendar.

Hope to see you all there joining us for some FUN dancing with callers and cuers from our CCCA membership. All dances at the Emerald Dance Center, 2095 Yolanda in Springfield.

 
Happy dancing!
Christina Corelli, Secretary, CCCA
