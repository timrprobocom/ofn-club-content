Willamette Squares went dark during what would have been our regularly scheduled dance so that dancers could attend Mid-Winter Festival. However, we were back in the saddle so to speak for our regularly scheduled February dance. We usually emphasize Valentine's Day and President's Day so we hope some of you attended for a sweetheart of a dance and an opportunity to reflect on our country's past presidents, especially Washington and Lincoln. 

Our club met recently to discuss whether to continue with lessons. We need to have enough students and angels who will be able to make a commitment for the session. Unfortunately our numbers have been down, so we will re-evaluate whether we will be offering more classes at this time.

Our club president has been in the hospital. Decisions need to be made regarding how to proceed with his treatment. We wish John well and a favorable outcome. Jodee
