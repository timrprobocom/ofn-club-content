Having to cancel two dances in a row due to inclement weather makes writing anything newsy a challenge.  The storms did show how important it is to check our website.  We will welcome all the canned foods that didn't get delivered because of the closures.  People are still hungry. 
 We could swap stories about how we coped with the storm.  (The top of one of my trees fell on the power line without breaking it.)  Those with yards can talk about how many yard debris bins it will take to haul away all the downed trees and branches.
 Then we can talk about how much fun it is to be back to dancing, which dances we are looking forward to, and what else is going on in our square dance world.  Call your friends to join you on a visit to another club, dance to another caller, another cuer.  Make up for those dances you missed.  Come visit Mix'nMingles.  The welcome mat is always out for you.
 We are sorry to report that long time member Ben Youngblood lost his wife.
