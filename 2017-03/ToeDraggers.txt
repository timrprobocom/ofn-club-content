Graduation for our new mainstream dancers went well and our new members are attending as many dances as possible, including Mid-Winter in Albany.  Way to go!!!
 We have been dancing up a storm to keep us warmed up for many outstanding dances.  The Toes have had fun visitors and you all bring friendships, smiles and much fun to our dances.  Thanks for coming out to support us. Fun times were had at Mid-Winter this year.  Thanks to everyone that helped make it a memorable dance weekend.
 February 3rd is our Heart and Roses Dance with KC calling and Bev cueing.  Our first dance of the month has pre-rounds and our second dance of the month has pre-plus.  Our dance on the 17th will be a regular dance.  Check our website for everything you need to know.  The Toes like to keep everyone on their toes with surprises and variety.
 March brings on the luck of the Irish.  Weâ€™ll be kicking up our heels on March 17th with the Luck of the Irish dance.  March 3rd is our regular dance.  We love our Kinton Grange and we hope to see you at many of our dances.  Bev and KC pick out great songs for us, so there is always a fun variety of music to dance to.  See you in a Square!!!!
