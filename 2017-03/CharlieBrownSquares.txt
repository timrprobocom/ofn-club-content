The Charlie's started a new beginner class in January. We currently have about 7 new students. Our September class is going strong with 7 students and they should be graduating in the next month or two.  We had a couple from the September class attend Mid-Winter and they had an absolutely wonderful time; as did everyone else that attended. What fun!! Thank you to the Committee!!
We had a good time at our 1st Saturday dance in February with about 3 squares in attendance. We are getting ready for a wonderful time Saturday February 18 at our Dance Down The Red Carpet Dance with special guest cuer Mark McDonald.  Promises to be lots of fun.
March 4 is our March Away The Blue MS/Plus dance with Ray calling and Mary Nutt cueing. March 18th is our Awkward Moments Plus/A1 Dance. Ray is out of town, so we have Wayne Weaver to help us through those awkward moments; as well as Bob Dingman providing the rounds.
The Boatnik Committee is hard at work planning for the Festival Memorial Weekend; be sure to get your ribbon before the price goes up May 1st. This is a wonderful weekend full of fun and laughter. We have Hunter Keller on squares and Randy Lewis on rounds.  You don't want to miss the party.  You can buy ribbons online at http://www.charliebrownsquares.com/Dance_Boatnik.php.
On another note, the Charlie's are looking for their banners and want to come to your dance to get them back.  If you have one of our banners; please let us know!!! Contact one of the officers to let us know!!!
I hope the weather finally is straightening out and no more dances are cancelled!! 
Here's to a great spring of dancing and friendship.
See you in a square!!
