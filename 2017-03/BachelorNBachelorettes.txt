Construction has officially started on our new bathrooms.  It wonâ€™t be long until us ladies get to use the hot tub and sauna the guys have long claimed they have in their bathroom. The club Director of Construction, Jack Hammer, says that the guys will be relegated to an outhouse in back, with the effluent flowing down to I-5.  How exciting!  We can hardly wait!
