The Columbia River Dancers have some good news and some bad news.  The bad news is that we were dark for the month of January except for two weeks of lessons.  Snow and bad weather kept us dark on the 14th and Mid-Winter was the fourth weekend.  I hear a great time was had by all who trekked to Albany.
 The other bit of bad news was that the Hazel Dell Grange ended up with two feet of water in the basement when the snow melted so anyone going downstairs for treats would have had to wear waders.
 It was bad news that my wife and I had to stay home from Mid-Winter this year.  The good news is my wife received her new hip on the January 30th.  She is looking forward to dancing again soon.  She said it could not come soon enough.
 More good news is that we are more or less back to normal.  Our classes are progressing fast, thanks to all of the angels who are there every Tuesday to guide the newbies through the calls.  A new class starts on the first Tuesday evening each month.
 The other good news is we are getting ready to celebrate our 2nd anniversary in March.  Adam Christman is coming over from Spokane to do the calling that evening so be sure to mark March 11th on your calendar.  Remember that we dance plus from 7 to 8 and mainstream from 8 on.  Our goal is to make sure everyone who attends gets to dance; therefore, we encourage singles to attend as well as couples.
 See you in a square.
