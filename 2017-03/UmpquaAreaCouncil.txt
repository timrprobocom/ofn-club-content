What a great time we all had at Mid-Winter.   A big shout out of thanks goes to the hard work of the committees and all of the helpers that worked behind the scenes to make things run smoothly at the festival.  We had a fabulous turn out at our January 21st New Dancer Dance. It was the LAST CHANCE DANCE before Mid-Winter so all of the new dancers had one last chance to get in a little more floor time before we headed to Mid-Winter.   We enjoyed the calling of six different callers.  Twelve of our twenty students joined us at the dance.  They all did a super good job of keeping up with the calls and a big thank you needs to go to Dale R, Chuck S, Phil R, Janienne A, Calob H, and Jean B. for their calling.  And of course, a thank you goes to Neil K.  for the great round dance tunes.  If you are looking for something fun to do the first Saturday in May, our Council will be hosting the next state dance the evening of May 6th.  Why not join us for a great evening of fun and dancing? (See the flyer for more info.)  Itâ€™s a great way to meet the delegates from throughout the state and get to know your executive board.  Hope you are able to join us for our Saiss de Mayo dance!
Hope to see you at the Barn,
Rita Schuchard
