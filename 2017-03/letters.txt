<li><a>Getting and Supporting Youth Dancers</a>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Over the past few years I have heard many people say that there is no need to try to get youth to start square dancing since we lose them after high school. I have also had many people ask how to get youth dancers. These are two very different situations that are very closely connected. A major consideration is that if you don&rsquo;t get a youth interested and dancing <u>before</u> they start college, you won&rsquo;t have much chance again until they have graduated. Also, unless we as a community of dancers support a college age dancer there is a very good chance that we will lose them</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Let&rsquo;s address how to get youth dancers first. Your first step is to find some youth who enjoy square dancing. Once you get a few youth, they will bring in more youth. The youth want to have fun and like to dance with other youth. If they can&rsquo;t dance with other youth at least once in a while, they will quit especially if the older dancers refuse to allow them to be &ldquo;wild and crazy&rdquo;. Set aside an area in your hall for an &ldquo;adventure&rdquo; square where dancers are allowed to cut in and out; do circle left/right at a run and other fast/fun moves. The youth dancer likes a fast paced dance and wants to add in lots of extras in the way of styling and fancy moves. To try to attract youth, contact school PTA&rsquo;s, churches, and local home school associations to try to set up demos/mini lessons with them for family nights. Promote dancing as an inexpensive family activity &ndash; this is very true compared to many other activities that families can be involved with. Make sure that youth and families can get to dances &ndash; often times they can be unsure of their welcome. Offer to meet them at a dance or pick them up. Treat youth dancers the same as you would the adult dancers &ndash; be welcoming to all.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">In the situation of &ldquo;losing youth after high school&rdquo; this is more of the youth going to college rather than losing interest. Youth are facing three difficulties towards dancing at this time if they are in college: time, finances and a feeling of being abandoned by the dancing community.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Time comes first &ndash; most college students are full time students which means that they are taking a minimum of 12 credit hours. This is the number of hours they are in a classroom. The colleges use a formula of 2-3 hours study time at home per credit hour which means a student taking the minimum of 12 hours also has 24-36 hours per week spent in study which equals a total of 26-48 hours per week. If they are taking 15 credit hours this expands to a total possible of 45-60 hours per week. Many students also add in a part-time job to help pay for college which takes another 20+ hours a week. For many of these youth, classes are taken during the day with work arranged around the class schedule &ndash; which translates into work in the evenings and weekends. This means that at our normal dance times, the college youth dancer is often at work. If there is a special dance or festival coming up, the college youth dancer can often request the time off of work, but there is no guarantee of them getting off.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Finances are next &ndash; college is expensive and getting more so each year. I don&rsquo;t have anyone at a 4-year college yet, but have been informed that students at Oregon State University pay between $20,000 - $22,000 per year for their tuition, fees, books, room and board. Other state/public colleges and universities are close to this range. A private university can double or quadruple this amount. Community Colleges are somewhat cheaper &ndash; but it still adds up. I remember 25+ years ago, community colleges had a set fee if you were a full-time student and once you paid that fee, you could take anywhere from 12-19 credit hours for the term. Now the community colleges charge per credit hour. Then you have the class/lab fees, books, additional expenses. Let&rsquo;s look at Chemeketa Community College for an example since I do have students there. A student taking 15 credit hours per term has tuition of $80 per credit, plus a $14 &ldquo;universal&rdquo; fee per credit equaling a cost of $94 per credit hour per term. For 15 credit hours, this equals tuition of $1,410 per term. If the student is taking an on-line course there is a $50 fee charged in addition to the base tuition. Students are told that they can expect a cost of approximately $450 per term for books and supplies. So base costs per term can equal up to $1,860 and when expanded out for a year (3 terms) equals $5,580. This does not include the parking permit fee of $40 for the year and other incidental fees such as library/copying on campus or special equipment for certain classes. To pay for this out of pocket, the youth must work at least 20 hours a week for 29 weeks at minimum wage. If a student is living at home, the parents&rsquo; income is taken into consideration for all financial aide, grants, job share, etc. and it doesn&rsquo;t take much parent income to make a student ineligible for a lot of these. Parental income is used until a student is 25 or 26 years old!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Third, we come to the feeling of abandonment &ndash; the college dancer wants to go to dances. When they are unable to do so, they miss the enjoyment, activity, and social community that they have become accustomed to and they miss contact with their dancer friends. If a college youth is working evenings and weekends they may not be able to attend dances due to their work schedule. For example, Thomas&rsquo; job at Wilco sometimes requires him to work until their 8:00 pm closing time. With dances starting at 7:30 pm, by the time he gets off of work, comes home, and cleans up he can&rsquo;t get to a dance much before they would end, so he doesn&rsquo;t go. If he has a day off and we are going to a dance, he tries to go with us. The dancing community members do talk to the family members of the college dancer &ndash; but this isn&rsquo;t the same as personal contact. The college dancer also gets tired of people asking, &ldquo;Where have you been, I&rsquo;ve seen your family&rdquo;. This dancer is in college and working! Please think about getting contact information for the college dancer and send them a quick email or text. They would love to hear from people they have come to know. They would also like to have a quick encouraging word &ndash; classes can be very difficult and the students do get discouraged. If a club and extended dancing community has little or no contact with a college dancer for the 2-8 years needed for their degree, why would the college dancer come back?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">It is important for all of us to remember &ndash; families and youth are who we need to bring into dancing in order to replace those of us who are aging out due to health, age and mobility. If we don&rsquo;t get younger dancers, eventually dancing will die out from a lack of dancers. We need to work to attract and keep them &ndash; this does mean an effort on the part of every dancer, not just a few families or a few youth. Make dancing enjoyable at lessons, regular dances, special dances and festivals. The more fun we make it, the more we make it attractive to prospective dancers. Make an effort to establish ties with youth and families &ndash; this will make it easier to support these dancers. Please remember when you or your family had youth and what you had to do to support them. Our current youth and families do need the same support &ndash; sometimes just a smile and a word of encouragement can mean the difference between keeping or losing a dancer.</p>
