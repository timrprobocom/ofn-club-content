<p>Mid-Winter has come and gone by with a good weekend for all. Spring lessons are in progress and hopefully doing well for those clubs and students involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended the memorial service for Harold Kleve. He is now calling for the big square in the sky and sharing his yodeling talents with those who went before him. Love the crowds he will call for and will await any of us who come after him. Not any time soon though.</p>
<p>I am preparing my heart for another funeral in the future. Our matriarch of the Oregon Federation, Genevieve Churchill, is not doing well under hospice care. She is not expected to make it to the end of February. I will miss her and so will a ton of other people who know her and love her. At 105 years of age, she has lived a wonderful, exciting life in her travels across the United States in her little station wagon. Oh, if that car could talk. What history of square dance we would all learn from her. My wish for her is to be comfortable and not in any pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ballots for voting for Federation officers will be in the mail by March 1 and are due back by May 1. Please encourage your club to take the time to do the voting and send back on time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reminder is to be thinking of who you would like to nominate for the Randall Award. The new nominations are due back to the past president, Kay Rogers, by Summer Festival. You have time to think about whom is worthy of the award and time to gather the information needed to fill out the form. Always fun to see who is nominated and what all they have done for square dance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully I will see you in a square somewhere soon in my travels around the state.</p>
