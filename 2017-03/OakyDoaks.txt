It finally looks like Winter is going to start being nice to the Oaky Doaks. January saw it take our first Saturday dance, “King of the Road”, and several of our No Experience Dances away from us. But it did show some kindness towards the end of the month by allowing us to get together to see what our fellow dancers wear when they are in the comfort of their homes at night and getting ready for bed. Our third Saturday dance, the Pajama Dance, went off without a problem. 

Winter even allowed us to go to Albany for the Mid-winter festival and dance to the Mike Seastrom and Hunter Keller as well as several of our caller friends such as our own Mike Halley. Those who enjoy the round dance were entertained by the cuing of Sharon and Casey Parker plus our cuer friends such as the Oaky Doaks’ cuer Helen Halley.

Even though Winter started February by denying us once again another No Experience Dance night he did show his soft side for animals by letting us hold our “Reigning Cats and Dogs” dance where we got together to support the AniMeals program with donations of cat and dog food. This year’s “winner” for the most pounds of donated food was once again the cats.

At the time of this writing we are looking to finally having a No Experience Dance and the chance to start the lessons following. As well as our Valentine’s Dance on the third Saturday of February, “Breaking Up is Hard to Do”. 

Even though March comes in like a lion, we are confident that it will allow us to meet for our Thursday night lessons, our “FIESTA” dinner and dance on Saturday, March 4th, and the “Irish Spring” dance on Saturday, March 18th, because what would the month be if we didn’t “Add a little Irish to our Game”.

So come join us as we shake off the Winter blues and put on our Spring greens.

See you on the dance floor.
