We have not had a dance since the end of February, and are dark the full month of August.  

Patrick Finn, one of our members who moved to Wisconsin has a new puppy!  She's a great Dane!  We look forward to seeing photos as she gets bigger and bigger!  We're glad Patrick is not alone.  

We are sad to let you know that Kris and Kurt Jensen's mom, Joan, passed away here in Eugene.  Our sympathies to Kris, Kurt and their families.  Joan lived an incredibly full life full of adventure, travel and service. 

We are continuing to rent the parking lot at the dance hall for a short visit on Sundays. We back our vehicles in a huge circle and either sit on our tailgates or bring a lawn chair. We can visit and see each other and maintain a safe distance. It works.

Stay safe and healthy,
