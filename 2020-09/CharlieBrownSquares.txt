The Charlies are still in a holding pattern in regards to classes & dances.  The club voted to hold off on classes until, hopefully, January. We typically have new classes in September & January. We will keep our fingers crossed for January.  No dances scheduled for September.  We currently have 1 dance scheduled in October, on October 3rd, with Michael Kious & Rikki Lobato; and will hope for the best.  The Charlie's website and facebook pages stay updated; so if there is ever any question - please check the website or contact one of the officers. Speaking of officers; we installed our new board; and would like to say congratulations to President: Carla Simpkins 1st VP: Jeanne Lobato 2nd VP: Lorri McIntosh Secretary: Candy Marie Erb & Treasurer: Michele Dunavant.  Thank you to the previous officers - all of you are appreciated!!
