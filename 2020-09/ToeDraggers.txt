The Toe Draggers are reportedly keeping so busy, I donâ€™t know how we ever had time to dance!  Just listing a few of their activities:  Playing with Grandkids, camping, hiking, beach combing, fishing, yard work, gardening, canning, organizing photos, discovering ancestors, puzzles, and one is recovering nicely from knee surgery.  WHEW! 
 I hope all of you are doing well and looking forward to dancing with you soon.
