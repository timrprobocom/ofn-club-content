 Several of the TVC clubs have come up with ways to keep in touch with their members.  There are Zoom meetings, small back yard gatherings, phone calls and emails, and an afternoon rally style game day.  See the Sunset Promenaders report below.
 One of the popular methods of keeping in touch is a club newsletter where members and other dancers are invited to share their experiences during the pandemic.  For information on how the clubs are doing this you can ask your question using the "Contact Webmaster" link on the websites for the Hoedowners, Eager Beavers, Sunset Promenaders, R Square D, Wavesteppers, or Oak Hills Squares.
 The annual "Seaside Sashay" held in late October and hosted by the TVC Promenaders and Hayshakers had to be cancelled due to Covid-19 concerns.
 Please, wear a mask in public places and stay safe until we can meet on the dance floor again.
