This is normally the time when we’re looking forward to and planning our fall square dance lessons! This year is completely different, and we miss the opportunity to gather as a club and make plans for the fall dance season. We hope you’ve enjoyed your summer and taken advantage of the delightful weather to spend some time outdoors. Here’s hoping we can find a silver lining to this year’s physical distancing and can keep a positive attitude as we look toward the future. Our square dance friends are absolutely some of the nicest people we know and so fun to spend time with! We look forward to when we can meet up again! Karen
