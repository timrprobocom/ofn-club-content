Like other clubs around the state our dances have been canceled and there is no knowing when we will be able to dance together again.  We know they are working hard at coming up with a vaccine that will help immunize us to this dreadful virus.

In the meantime it is nice to stay in contact by reading the OFN, watching for email reports from members and other square dancing friends.  We were all sorry to hear Mike Sikorsky was hopsitalized for a very long time with what wascalled pneumonia at first, then double pneumonia, then MRES, and then it all went into sepsis.  He is lucky to be alive and have made it through all that.  Mike liked to come through Oregon and call here and there upon occasion and some have been lucky to travel to Arizona and get to dance to his fine calling.  We wish him well.

Our club may still have a gathering which will not be our traditional picnic but a way to reconnect with one another until we can get back on the dance floor.  Perhaps it will happen in September while the weather holds.

Be well.  'Til we meet again.
