The month is almost upon us and there are changes coming to the club. We will have guest cuers until we can decide on what is happening in the club. Our co-cuers gave their 30 day notice at the end of July, so we are in contact with a few to see if they can come and cue for us until we figure out what our future is going to be.

We are still dancing weekly on Thursdays through the end of August from 7-9 p.m. for our summer sessions, unless the Governor decides otherwise. I think we will be dark on September 3 for the long Labor Day weekend, in case people have plans to go somewhere. Then, we will start fall sessions at 6:30 p.m. with the intro to Phase 3 dancing with a rhythm to be determined, when we get a cuer to help us out.

We had a summer dance scheduled for August 15, but it is too soon to report on how that went, and too soon to cancel in case the Governor decides otherwise. We are kind of in-between things at the moment.

We hope to see you in our dance hall for an evening of round dancing whenever you are in the vicinity. Marilyn Schmit
