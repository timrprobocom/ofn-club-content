Since the Country Cut-Ups own their own building, we are not restricted by the closure of all the Granges, so we have started round dance lessons.  Tammy Helms is teaching beginning waltz on Sunday evenings.  We are restricting the size of the class to comply with the social distancing requirements The class is not full so we still have room for more students, however the class did start on Aug. 9th.  We are requiring students bring their own partner. For further information, contact Young Lumsden at 503-791-7779. We are considering having a dance in our building that would be round dancing only with social distancing provisions, no date is set yet.

We are having line dance lessons on Thursday nights with beginning from 5pm to 6pm and advanced from 6pm to 7pm, again, with social distancing rules in place. Club member, Lynn Wunische is instructing. So far, all of the classes have been held on our outdoor dance floor.

Our annual Pancake Breakfast has been cancelled this year.  As with everyone, we are dearly missing the square dancing and being together.  To date, we are all staying healthy.
