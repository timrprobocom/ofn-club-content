Our board has kept meeting over Zoom the last few months, but we've decided to skip September.  We've cancelled our annual August picnic also.  But the good news is that only 4 members have declined to renew their membership for the coming year!  Gotta dance! 
 This pandemic has made it difficult for our grange too, so our contract hasn't been negotiated for the coming year yet.  But they have agreed to let us know first if they have someone else wanting to rent it on one of our normal dance nights, so that we could keep that date ourselves if we are able to dance together by that time.  We all miss each other and dancing together, so, since our club’s monthly newsletter is very empty now, the board has asked members to submit their “Covid-19” stories to share through the newsletter, so we could all keep more in touch.  Looking forward to that!
