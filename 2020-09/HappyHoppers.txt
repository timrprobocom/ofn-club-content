Current motto:  We will survive!  Some of us are brainstorming ways to keep our members engaged and interested.  Two such motivated people in our club are Liza and Tom Halpenny.  They are doing Zoom meetings every Monday at 7 pm which would be our normal time for lessons.  We do square dancing for one couple and then Tom and Liza trade off teaching various line dances which we can do in the living room.  Our current assignment is for everyone to bring one joke to the meeting which we share at the end.  It's a truly enjoyable way to enjoy an hour with our square-dancing friends.  

At our recent board meeting it was decided to notify our members that we will be in touch with them as soon as it is feasible to start activities again.  We had previously notified them that we might possibly start lessons again in September but here in Washington the granges are still closed unless certain stringent guidelines are followed, ie, complete sanitation of the entire building before and after an event.  That is not a realistic possibility for our club. 
 
So we will continue to brainstorm and try to keep square dancing in the minds and hearts of our membership as "Stay safe" becomes a common refrain.
