title: Seaside Sashay Cancellation
---
The Hayshakers and Sunset Promenaders sadly made the decision to cancel the 20th Annual Seaside Sashay that had been scheduled for October, 2020. With the restrictions imposed due to the Covid 19 Pandemic, it was just not possible to bring all the wonderful dancers together in October. We regret having to make this decision, but will start working on 2021 plans to make the event better than ever!  All registrations will be rolled over to 2021 unless you request a refund. Prices for the 2021 Seaside Sashay will be the same as 2020’s and we will be publishing the registration form in a few months. We hope all who are registered for this year’s event will choose to roll over your registration to next year, however if you need to request a refund, please email Joyce Clark at: joyceaclark007@gmail.com or mail a refund request to Joyce & Gary at 1824 SE Quail Circle, Hillsboro, OR 97123.

The organizers of the Royal Romp, traditionally held in the first week of November, have had to make the difficult decision to cancel this year.  We hope to see all of you next year.
