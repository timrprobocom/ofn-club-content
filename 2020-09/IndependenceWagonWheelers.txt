Since we haven’t been able to meet in person, there have been periodic e-mail updates from our members. There has been a lot of gardening happening; one gentleman has made quite a number of masks; some people continue to work at home; several members have been making quilts; one member is a camp host. Everyone seems to be doing their part by social distancing and wearing masks when it is appropriate. We still wait (impatiently) until we can dance again. The hall has been painted and the floor refinished, so we will be dancing in a “new” hall. LaVerne
