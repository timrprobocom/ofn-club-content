Hello everyone, 

So here comes September, that means no square dances since spring, through summer and soon we’re into fall.

I really miss the dancing.  On a happy note, Chaps and Petticoats picked up two more members in May (that makes four since February’s graduation). On JULY 5th, wearing masks and social distancing, we planned a BBQ picnic at a member’s home on the waterfront.  It was such a beautiful day, we enjoyed each other’s company immensely! 

Chaps and Petticoats can hardly wait to introduce you to the lively and refreshed Maplewood Grange.  While the Grange is closed to rentals (that’s us), the lockdown has allowed much-desired improvements to take place ...we will share the upgrades with you in the near future.

When we are back to dancing, students and Angels, alike, are going to need refreshers - look forward to seeing you then.

Stay healthy, 
Betty Chipps
