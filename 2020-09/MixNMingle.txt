M&M’s (the official Company not our square dance club) has come out with a new flavor; Fudge Brownie.  Don’t they sound yummy?  Almost as good as the “Boo-terscotch” that came out last Halloween.  I’m anxious to get them into our dispensers  for everyone to nibble on in between tips - once we get back to dancing, that is.   
 Hmmm.  Maybe I should stock up just in case they are a “limited edition”.
 We will keep you updated on calendar changes thru this OFN report as well as our website:  www.mixandminglesquares.org
