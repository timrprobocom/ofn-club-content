With the trend in COVID-19 cases moving in the wrong direction, the Ramblers have reluctantly decided to cancel all dance activities through December 31. We do not foresee an opportunity to dance safely and comfortably until a vaccine is approved and available to the general population. In the interest of predictability and fairness to our members (who paid for a service we cannot deliver), we decided to proactively suspend all activities for the rest of 2020. We will offer members a prorated refund of their dues, or an opportunity to roll over their membership to 2021.

After our successful masked Ramble in Sellwood in July, we decided to Remake the Ramble on August 8. This time we gamboled through Portland's Irvington neighborhood. We marveled at some truly magnificent mansions, some vintage apartment buildings, and some stately old trees lining one of Portland's most elegant neighborhoods. The weather was beautiful and comfortably cool, so mask-wearing was certainly tolerable. 

We will plan another Ramble for early September...got to get these walks in while climatology is working in our favor.

We hope everyone is staying healthy and sane. We look forward to getting back on the dance floor soon.
