If you have driven by our hall on a weekday morning, you might have noticed cars in the parking lot, windows open, lights on, and the sound of music coming from inside and wondered what was happening. Well it is our long-time renters, the jazzercise class which continues to use the hall most week day mornings. They all wear masks, bring their own water bottles, and practice social distancing. Unfortunately, social distancing is not possible with square dancing.

River City Dancers is still not yet dancing and we are waiting until it is safe to do so. When the day comes that we are dancing again, I am sure you will be able to hear the loud outcry of joy. Just In case you have your windows and doors closed at that time and do not hear all the joyful celebration, we will be sure to notify you when we dance again. Meanwhile, stay safe and healthy and hang on to the hope that we will all be together again and dancing soon.
