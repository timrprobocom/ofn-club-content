This is my last letter to the OFN as the Federation president. Welcome to Gary Clark as our new president.

This has been a unique year in our experiences both in dancing and in the world. Please continue to work at keeping in touch with other dancers, neighbors and family as our situation continues.

Good wishes and good luck to Gary as he takes office at our meeting this month.

Greetings to all Square and Round Dancers within the Oregon Federations. 

As incoming Federation President I want to give Karyn Buchhiet a big thank you for her good job as State President this past year.  It was different leading the Federation during a pandemic.  You did a good job, Karyn.  All of your state officers made the adjustment to this new situation.  I want to also thank your Secretary Roberta Claudson for adjusting to this situation despite going through a family tragedy.  We all understand your need to resign and have time to heal.  Thanks to Lorri McIntosh for taking the appointment to fill this slot and becoming the Federation Secretary. 

As we move forward with an uncertain square and round dance future, we have to remember we are all in this together.  We need to be safe with social distancing.  I have seen emails that a group of callers are doing on line meetings to discuss getting started again when the timing is right.  There are also round dance clubs having dances with social distancing in mind, as well as following the CDC and Oregon State guidelines.  This is all fine if you are comfortable with this.  No pressure to participate if it’s not the right timing for you.

There will be a different format for clubs starting back up, I’m sure.  We officers of the Federation are always here to help as soon as we find out the go ahead under Phase III.  This will be the timing for all dancing, I do believe.  However some counties of the state could move forward with CDC permission because of low COVID-19 incident rate.  At this time the Portland tri-county area is the hot spot for cases.  This will all take time to resolve. 

I want to thank each and every one of you for your confidence in me to lead this Federation.  Time will tell what the "new normal" will be.  Until then, hang in there.  Plan some functions with your club with social distancing, and keep in touch with a suggested weekly Club Update email with contributions from the members on what they are doing.  My club, the Sunset Promenaders, and others, are doing a good job with this connection with the members.  Keep it up until we get back to dancing and we WILL be dancing again. 

Swing your partner anytime.

Gary Clark
