Phyllis Baldwin, long time member of the River City Dancers, passed away peacefully in her sleep on August 21 at 8 AM.   She was enjoying her facilities but needing more sleep. She just had her 96th birthday on July 11!  She was living near Missoula, Montana, close to her son, Blake Ludwig.   If you wish to send a card this is the son's address:  
Blake & Caryn Ludwig  
405 S. 5th St. W.  
Missoula, MT 59801

Her son Craig lives up the Gorge.  Phyllis was a joy to all of us.  We've been missing her as she had been in Montana for a year.

Phyllis & Julius Smith were great ambassadors for the River City Dancers.  They kept people interested and joining our Club, and we will miss them both.  Julius passed away the first week of June.
