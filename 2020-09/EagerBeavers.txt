At least we are not in solitary confinement, we still have phones and computers, to reach out to others.  We have newspapers, TVs and smart phones to let us know what is happening out side of our personal cells.  What if we had no way to get information about our common enemy, Covid-19?  Do not try to answer that question.  The answer might look like a horror movie. 
 On the bright side it is easy to make somebodyâ€™s day with just a call or a note making both of you feel a lot better.  This time out also makes us appreciate all those things we take for granted; socializing with friends, taking spur of the moment trips, shopping when you feel like it, celebrating birthdays and weddings,  dining in a restaurant, visiting a friend or family in a care facility,  and so on.  
 While I am thinking about things missed, I miss our callers and cuers.  They must be bored out of their skulls.  Give your caller a call too. 
 My thanks to those who are making an effort to find ways to keep the dancing going even with just one couple at a time.
 Keep checking for our start date at www.EagerBeavers.info.
 The following message is for your information when life as we used to know begins again: We dance on most holidays.  Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons, 1:00 p.m. - 3:00, at the Aloha Grange, 3425 SW 185th, Beaverton, 97006
