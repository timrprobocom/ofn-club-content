Hello to all of our square and round dance friends.  The Columbia River Dancers are not dancing now but that does not mean we are not seeing each other.  We have had a variety of drive-by birthday gatherings.  A group meets at some local spot, decorates their cars and drives by the birthday house honking and making a big racket for all the neighbors to hear.  Many of us will stop and distance greet and lament the lack of dancing.  Melissa James has been great about bringing cupcakes along to the get-togethers.  Our president, Dale Smith, has been battling migraine headaches for some time so ask that you include him in your prayers.
