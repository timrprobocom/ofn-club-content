Not much news to report. Like many other clubs we are in a holding pattern. We are waiting to see what other clubs decide to do and what their plans are. Our biggest challenge is where to dance. All of our party nights are usually held at a local school, but with the current debate going on concerning how schools will reopen and what guidelines will be set, we can not have use of any schools. Other places suitable for dancing are either in the same situation or too expensive to rent. We have been in contact with our most active dancers, and the general feeling is wait until things mellow out or some kind of definite vaccine is available. When we do get back to dancing we will have a temperature gun to take temps of those attending, we will also have hand sanitizer, and extra masks. We will encourage people to bring their own drink cups, bottles etc. We hope everyone is staying safe and doing their part to keep others safe.
