March was a good month for our Plus Classes.  Our students are progressing nicely and we are looking forward to dancing with these remarkable dancers.  Do they come for the excellent instructors or the snacks the members bring in for all to enjoy?  Our members have been excellent signing up and bringing in the goodies which all of us enjoy.  Thank You for doing such a great job!
 Hoedowners held their annual Trophy Dance and we almost won the trophy.  We were 0.5% short! We only needed one more to show up.  We will win next year, for sure.
We had a good group and a great time attending the Valley Squares 67th Anniversary Dance on the 19th.  Sixty seven years is amazing.  Congratulations to Valley Squares!
 St. Patrickâ€™s Day was observed by wearing a bit of green and dancing to Irish music.
 For summer fun, plan to attend Summer Festival in Seaside from July 29th-31st.
 Warning! On Memorial Day, May 30th, we will dance at the Aloha Grange, 185th Ave. and TV Highway.  Sunset Presbyterian Church will be closed that day.
 We dance on holidays.  Even if you have a job, you can join us once in a while.  Our three callers keep us on our toes as each week one seems to have some new twist to keep our minds sharp.  All plus dancers are invited to dance with us on Monday afternoons: Rounds 1:00 - 1:30 (Rounds will start at 1:15 during lessons); Plus 1:30 - 3:15 PM, Sunset Presbyterian Church, 14986 NW Cornell Road in Beaverton.  We dance on holidays too so if you have a day off come join us.  Our next holiday dance that will be at Aloha Grange is on Memorial Day, May 30th.
