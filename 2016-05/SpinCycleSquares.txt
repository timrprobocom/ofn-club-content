Carol Campbell, who dances with us lost her husband recently.  We are all so very sorry.  Fred bravely battled cancer. We offered gift cards to their favorite pizza places and will continue to take care of Carol. Several of us plan to attend a gathering for Fred on April 23 to support Carol and her family.
 	We encourage our members to run for office for the 2016-2017 dance season. Tim Matteson offered to continue being our delegate at the hall meetings.  Thanks Tim! 
 	By now the Dan Nordbye dance, April 12, will have happened.  Dan is such a good caller whose program changes each year.  His dances are always interesting and a heck of a lot of FUN! We look forward to Dan coming back in 2017!  Dan loves to go to breakfast with some of us at Brail's the morning after. Dan always stays with Christina and Kirby and Meko, the cat.
 	We continue to dance all levels from 5:30 - 8:00 most Sundays in Hall A at the hall in Sprngfield. We encourage you to join us. Please call Tim at 541-988-0399 or our president, David at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are dancing. We rarely go dark, but you never know. We do know that we are dark May 29th, Memorial Day weekend. 
 	Our hall has a cushioned wood floor for your dancing ease and pleasure.
 
Happy dancing! - Christina Corelli - Member-At-Large for Spin Cycle Squares
