Wow, what a March.  The month came in like a lion both weather-Â­wise and dance-wise.   The club celebrated its first anniversary with its "Blue and Green" dance with Adam Christman calling to eight squares.  We had lots of round dancers there as well.  Cake, punch, good friends, and lots of blue and green goodies and decorations made the evening all the more enjoyable.
 This was followed by Randy Dibble on the 26th keeping us on our toes and challenging us to the max.  We had 7 squares in attendance and 5 to 6 squares on the floor all night long.  Our Guest Cuer, Debbie Combs, played a wonderful mix of old and new tunes.  It was great to have so many round dancers with us.
 May will bring us flowers, longer days, and more dancing.  On the 14th of May, wear your flowery outfit and join us.  Remember, we dance Plus from 7:00 to 8:00 pm and Mainstream from 8:00 on.   On the 28th, our amazing Caller, Jim Hattrick, will be calling and cueing our dance.
 Our last set of Beginner lessons began on Tuesday, 4/5.
 Just as a reminder, we will NOT be going dark during the summer so keep your skills sharp and be sure to join us at the Hazel Dell Grange.
