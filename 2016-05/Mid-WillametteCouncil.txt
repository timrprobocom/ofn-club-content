A big Thank You goes out to the dancers who supported the MWA Spring Dance on April 3, hosted by the Braids and Braves. We had four squares on the floor most of the afternoon. Leonard Snodgrass was the caller MC and Sandra Pinion was the cuer MC for the event, supported by other MWA callers and cuers. The youth from Silver City Squares were presented a check from the MWA to help them attend the competition in May.
