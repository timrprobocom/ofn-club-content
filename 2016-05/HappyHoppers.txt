The prospects for the future of the Clark County Square Dance Center, our home venue, are becoming much harder to evaluate.  In  February, the church across the street offered to buy the property and the shareholders voted to accept their offer.  In the meantime, surveyors discovered that the fence to the south, which had been assumed to be on the boundary line for many years, is actually 12 feet onto the CCSDC property.  That means that 12 feet of the property may be lost to the southern neighbor due to what's called "adverse possession".  Because of the same surveying discrepancy, much of the north parking lot which we've been using all these years actually belongs to the neighbor to the north.  Therefore, the property which was put up for sale is potentially smaller than it was thought to be.  In the meantime, the church has asked for an extra 90 days to realign their finances for the purchase.  So, things are up in the air.  Negotiations are on-going.  It's all very complicated.  Come back next month.  Maybe I'll have more to tell you.

We will host our regular first and third Saturday dances at the Clark County Square Dance Center with Jim Hattrick calling and cueing.  The May 7 dance will be our annual anniversary dance with the theme of "A Hawaiian Beach Party".  As part of our on-going effort to accommodate Mainstream dancers, this special dance will feature Mainstream calling on every third tip.  

Our lessons are "dark" for the summer season, to resume in September.  We had a wonderful season since September, welcoming 104 new dancers.  Counting students and angels, our attendance averaged 60 per week.
