Valley River Dancers had a blast hosting a bus trip to Roseburg to join the Timber Eights as they celebrated their anniversary by dancing to The Crew. Randy, Jim, Les, and  Daryl kept the crowd twirling and spinning at the Buckaroo Barn. Thanks for the fun time!!

We will be dark the Friday of Memorial Day Weekend (May 27) because the club groupies are following Randy to Bend for a dance with the Bachelor Buttes. 

It's never too early to save the date for our Dance Under the Stars, Friday, July 22 in Newberg. Perrin Damon
