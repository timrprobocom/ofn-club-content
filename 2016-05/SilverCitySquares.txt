Our youth had their fundraiser dance and it brought in close to $800. Thank you to everyone who attended and supported our youth. We had a lot of fun. Our raffle winners were: Cherrie Hutchison, Richard Buchheit and Tiffin Sinks. Congratulations!  Our youth have been working hard at practices and we are working on some fancy choreography for the endings of the songs that our callers will do for competition. Throughout the month, we have been getting lots of support and we are very grateful for all of the help that will allow us go up to competition.
Silver City Squares May dance is our last one until September and we are having a pie night! This is also right after competition. Please come and see all of the trophies that we hope to bring home. Petrina Buchheit
