We had two great dances in April, one with national caller Dan Nordbye on April 9. We are having a great year as our dances are being well attended with at least four to five squares per dance. We are having fun!
We have some great things coming in May. Saturday May 7 will be our “Cinco De Mayo Dance”. This is going to be a great dance. We will have Pinata’s, games, and Mexican food.  George Hermann will be calling and Ralph Lambert will be cueing. Come and share the fun. We welcome all dancers.  We will have pre rounds at 7:30 and Mainstream dancing from 8:00-10:30 P.M. We look forward to seeing everyone. Look for the flyer in the OFN.
IWW also has an AED available for sale. If your club is interested in having a defibrillator, contact Joni O’brien, our club president. This AED has never been used. You can contact Joni at jobrien58@msn.com or 503-623-8353.  See you in a square. Sandy Eddings
