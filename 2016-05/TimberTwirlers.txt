March was a fun month with our annual Irish Potato dance. We had lots of wearing of the green and lots of baked potatoes with all the trimmings. Thanks to Susan and Allan Jackson for cooking all of those. We even had lots left over for guest to take home.
April 1st we had our April Foolish dance and some interesting clothes were worn but the dancers and caller/cuer. We will be having our Birthday dance April 17 at the Eagles in Albany and that should be a great time. See our flyer in the OFN.
In May will see two dances, on May 5 and on May 20. The dance on the 20th will be a dancer appreciation dance with our Sundaes on Friday dance. Yum! It will also be a benefit dance for the IOOF Hall to try and make repairs on our parking lot (it is in bad need of it). If you can't come but would like to donate to the cause, you can contact me at sandy.harris@comcast.net or President Bev at 541-926-3138. Hope to see you soon in a square. Sandy Harris
