<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">We are having our May Flowers dance on May 7th.&nbsp; Flowers make me smile and it is so reassuring to see their cheery colors and faces after the rainy, gloomy days of winter and early spring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">On May 21st we invite you to put on your scuba suits, masks, and flippers and sink on down to the Aloha Grange floor at our Dancing Under the Sea Dance, in honor of National Maritime Day.&nbsp; Okay, regular comfy attire would be fine.&nbsp; Dancing in scuba gear would be quite a challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">We have a new format at each of these dances, with New Dancer level from 7-8, Mainstream from 8-9, and Plus, 9-10, with Open Break in the Quilt Room throughout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">One other event is happening in May: our New Dancers Jamboree May 22nd at Aloha Grange, 1-3 p.m.&nbsp; We will also give you a great deal on gently used clothing: $1 for pettipants, belts &amp; ties; $2 for skirts, shirts, blouses, dresses &amp; shoes and $5 for petticoats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">March kept us hopping like the Easter Bunny.&nbsp; We started with a wonderful visitation from River City Dancers to our Read Across America Dance.&nbsp; The donated books made their way to Jefferson, where they will be sold to help raise money for building the new Jefferson Library.&nbsp; The next Saturday we battled Eager Beavers for the trophy at Hoedowners' Stache Dance.&nbsp; That was followed by our New Dancers (Basic Level) Jamboree which had 7+ squares of students from our class and all over the area, particularly Oaky Doaks and Tualatin Timbers.&nbsp; We ended the month with Randy Dibble and Chuck teaming up to call a lively night at our 67th Anniversary Dance, with Connie Clark cueing.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The Valley Squares will be having the Trophy Dance on June 18th. The club with the highest percentage of members attending steals the trophy and gets to host their own Trophy Dance.&nbsp; We are having national caller Gary Monday will be calling this dance.&nbsp; See the flyer in the Special Dances area in this issue.</span></p>
