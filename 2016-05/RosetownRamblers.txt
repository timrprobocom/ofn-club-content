<p>There were big doings at the Ramblers&rsquo; April dance at the Milwaukie Grange. Before we hit the hardwood, we held our annual membership meeting. We elected a new Board, consisting of:</p>
<p>President: Jeff Knapp</p>
<p>Vice President: Ariel Shattan</p>
<p>Treasurer: Ken Vannice</p>
<p>Secretary: Jan Thompson</p>
<p>Caller Liaison: Rick Hawes</p>
<p>Member at Large: Tiffany Naemura</p>
<p>Member at Large: Clint Maurice</p>
<p>Class Representative: Joanna Schaefer</p>
<p>Our membership also voted to make important changes to our dance schedule. Starting in September 2016, the Ramblers will move our monthly dances to the second Saturday of each month. In looking at the schedules of other clubs in the Portland area, we noted that many clubs dance the first and third Saturdays (as do the Ramblers). By moving to the second Saturday, we hope our members will have more opportunities to visit other clubs&hellip;and that members of other clubs will come visit us. Will we see you in September???</p>
<p>The second schedule change involves moving our dance start time from 7 to 7:30 pm. This change, which was necessitated by a scheduling conflict at the Milwaukie Grange, will take effect starting in May 2016. So, until further notice, our monthly dances will alternate Mainstream and Plus tips from 7:30 to 9:30 pm.</p>
<p>After all of that intense noodling on administrative matters, we needed to get down to the real business of the club, dancing up a storm to the high-speed high jinks of caller Gary Monday from Seattle. He did his usual stellar job of calling for us.</p>
<p>Our next monthly dance will be May 7 at the Milwaukie Grange. Professor Ian Craig will be calling, as our square dance scholars celebrate their Mainstream graduation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll close out our dance year on June 4, with Don Wood calling. The Ramblers are dark in July and August, but Ramblers roam, and we may just turn up at a dance near you!</p>
<p>SYIAS!</p>
