We have another month reprieve in which we can save the Clark County Square Dance Center from being sold. This is a facility for which many clubs across the continent would mortgage their souls to own.  â€&ldquo; One of the few facilities actually built as a dance hall, with the floor mounted on springs.

To keep this wonderful facility in our possession, we need volunteers to buy up the existing shares from other elderly people who are retiring and need the money to live on. Then serve on the voting board of the corporation.

Not only may you save a revered dance facility, but you may also make a lot of money, knowing how real estate prices are increasing.   Lastly, it would be a shame to lose this fine facility due to apathy.
