As you may have heard, the Oregon Federation is the recipient of a
large inheritance from Susan Corbett. Susan was a long time dancer in
the singles community. She specifically liked Advanced and higher level
rounds. She was surrounded by her square dance friends during her battle
with cancer.
<p>
The amount of the inheritance is $75,000. There is much we can do with this unexpected windfall.
<p>
I personally would like to see the money evenly distributed to the clubs
in the Federation.
<p>
We welcome your input as to how you would like to see this money
used. Contact any of the Federation Board or your Council Delegate to
give your input. We will be discussing this at the May 15 meeting in
the Blue Mountains council.
