March 12th was our Trophy/Stache Bash Dance.  What’s that you say?  Heck, we were celebrating the all American hirsute tradition of the Mustache!!  Frankly, we Hoedowners had become accustomed to all the cookie dusters and soup strainers that male members were already sporting.  A few, namely Chet Wolter and Mike Duyck, joined the fray by growing lip rugs for the occasion and just to keep it fair, temporary lipholstery was available for all participants (the things you can’t find at the Dollar Store).  Didn’t the ladies look lovely?  Richard Lane was our guest caller, mustached as usual, and energized the evening.  Chuck Garner joined Richard on stage to call a tip.  Hmmm, Chuck wears a mustache too.  Is there some kind of theme going here?  The Valley Squares organized a visitation to our Trophy Dance as did the Eager Beavers.  It was a close race with the Valley Squares beating out the Eager Beavers by 0.5%.  Valley Squares reclaimed the Trophy so watch their schedule for an opportunity for your club to take the Trophy home.  Once again the Aloha Grange is making improvements to the facility.  In March they added sound dampening panels to the dining room and ballroom.  Come join us and you’ll notice the difference.
 Our Spring Fling dance was the 26th.  It was the night before Easter and the large group of dancers seemed to be in a spring mood.  I didn’t notice the Easter Bunny but Daryl served up Hot Hash at the end of the evening.  Does hash go with deviled eggs?  I prefer ham.  Thanks to everyone who joined us.
 Don’t forget our Fiesta Dance will be May 14th followed on May 28th by our annual celebration of that grand American tradition; our Red, White and Blue Dance.
