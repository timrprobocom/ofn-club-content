What a great 55th Anniversary Dance we had on March 19! Four squares were on the floor and more people were visiting on the benches. Our Silent Auction went very well and we enjoyed seeing some former members. We had visitors from Salem Swinging Stars, Timber Twirlers, Independence Wagon Wheelers and several independents. The Wagon Wheelers took home one of their banners. Our great caller, Leonard Snodgrass, called another lively, fun dance and Sandra Pinion did her sparkling job of cueing Rounds. Bruce Lowther also called a tip and Judy Russell cued a set of Rounds. Thanks to all our hard-working club members and the visitors who came to celebrate with us. We always look forward to seeing guests come dance with us. Carmen Rost
