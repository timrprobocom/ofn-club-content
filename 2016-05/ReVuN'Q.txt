The club continues to review various rhythms through the end of April during our lesson time. May 5 we will start Tango lessons at 7:30. If you are ready to start your adventure into the intermediate level of round dancing, then come and join us for Tango from the start. We are encouraging those who are ready to move to the next level to try it out and see how you do. We are ready to assist you in success.
The club has voted for state officers and club officers, and we are working on plans for our 40th birthday party in June. Save the date of June 16 and join us as we come together to celebrate the fact that the club is still going after 40 years. A lot of clubs have folded in that time. 
Stay tuned for guest cuers as Cheryl and Geof take time to attend ICBDA, USA West, and a round dance weekend at Circle 8 in Cle Elum, WA. Our club vice president is working on getting a guest cuer to come in and tame the bunch of us. It worked last year and will again this year. See you soon. Marilyn Schmit
