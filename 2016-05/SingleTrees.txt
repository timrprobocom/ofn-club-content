<p>March 11th was our "Go Green" dance with caller Jim Hattrick. We had a good turnout (5 squares) and Jim really delivered. It was so good to have him call for us once again and we thanked all our visitors for joining us. Jim Voll pulled off another good dance on March 26th, and we had a pretty good group of dancers as well. But in the Emerald Area one of the many terrific dances that we support and attend is the Emerald Empire Council Dance - which is a benefit dance for the Honor Flight. Since it is on April 30th, we will have already attended it by the time you read this, but next month (the June issue) we'll give you all the particulars on what went on, how much money was raised by the silent auction, and how the dancers loved all the callers and cuers.</p>
<p>On April&nbsp;8th, we had a great dance with with KC Curtis calling and Jackie Gale cueing our "Spring Fling." On April 22nd, Chuck Garner will be calling and Christinia Corelli will be cueing. We are looking forward to a fun time and hope some of you will join us.</p>
