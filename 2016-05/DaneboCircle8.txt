Our club is making the transition from having two dances a month to just one starting this September.  Our dances starting in the fall will be the third Saturday of each month.  We are always dark in July, but that may change as well.  So, starting this September come and dance with us the third Saturdays. 
    Our current president, Randy Graboyes, has graciously agreed to continue as president for the coming dance season. Pat Preston, who had agreed to run for president, had to step down as she is undergoing cancer treatments again.  We keep Pat in our thoughts and pray she is able to beat cancer once again. 
    We wish to thank the following new officers: Randy Graboyes, president, Rosco Isbell, Vice-President, Tonie Nichols, Treasurer and Dianne Trippett, Secretary.  Betty Aukerman continues to be our 'Sunshine Lady' sending birthday cards, anniversary cards, sympathy cards and get well cards to our members. 
    Lifetime member, Mimi Mills, is home following several weeks in rehab.  Mimi did so much for the club and the hall the past 25 years.  It's taking more than one person to do what Mimi did all by herself.  We love you Mimi!  Thank you! 
    Come dance with us the first and third Saturdays.  We are dark May 21st.  The cloggers have a mini-convention at the hall that weekend which sounds like a lot of fun.  We will be dancing June and August and are dark in July. 
    Christina will have a round dance party May 14th, the second Saturday at the hall from 7 - 9:30 p.m.
