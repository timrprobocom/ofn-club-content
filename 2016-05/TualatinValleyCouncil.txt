Since the publication date for the May issue is mid April, you still have time to plan on attending "Spring Fling", a fifth Saturday dance on April 30th at the Aloha Grange, 3425 SW 185th Avenue, Aloha.  Jim Hattrick will be calling and Ken Pratt cueing.  Pre-rounds begin at 7:30 followed by Mainstream at 8:00 with Plus Tips and Intermediate Rounds interspersed through the evening.  The dance will continue until 10:30 with an open break from 8:30 to 10:00.  Come join the fun.
