Our club has been busy. Mainstream lessons are going great on Wednesdays as is Randy's A1/A2 class. We had a visitation to Silver City Squares and the Independence Wagon Wheelers came to visit us! Great fun and dancing! April 15tmarked our 50th year as a club. 

Our 5th Friday Plus dance will be on April 29. Chuck Garner will call and Ken Pratt is cueing as Randy, Jeanine and about 120 others will be sailing the ocean blue.
We dance all year round. Our hall is air conditioned so come join us on the first and third Fridays of the month at the SSDC. See you on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
