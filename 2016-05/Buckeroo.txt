March was a busy month here at the Buckeroo Barn! Our first dance of the month was our Welcome Spring Dance. We were treated to some of Dale Roberson’s yodeling as he was the caller that evening. We had about four squares out on the floor and all of the new dancers were doing great. 

The following weekend we had a visitation to the Star Promenader’s dance in Medford. We carpooled together and ended up with a full two squares, so we were able to bring home a banner.

Our second dance of the month was our 50’s themed dance. Don Marshall called and did a great job finding lots of music from that era for us to dance to. We had many visitors from both the north and the south, so we ended up with eight squares out on the floor. A great time was had by all as we danced and snacked on fries, floats, and sundaes!

We spent a lot of time preparing for our annual Barn Sale during March.  All of our members worked together and everything was a huge success. We certainly appreciate the investment that our members make in our club.

Keep dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
