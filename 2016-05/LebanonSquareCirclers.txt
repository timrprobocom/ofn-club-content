Our club had a busy March and then we had our Hippie Dance on April 2. Dances have been great with Charlotte Jeskey calling and Jackie Gale cueing. 

A slate of officers for 2016-2017 has been elected with Wanda Frenzel-President, Frank Cawrse-Voce President, Kaynor Heineck-Secretary, Barb Newton-Treasurer, and Jo Baker-Area Rep. 

We are looking forward to going on our Mystery Trip on April 30. 

Our big celebration is coming up the first weekend of June with our STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL AND CAMPOUT -- June 3 - 5, 2016. There will be a Trails End Dance on Friday night with callers from the floor. Potlucks every night, our big Festival dance on Saturday night with Randy Dibble calling and Jackie Gale cueing; and breakfast on Sunday morning. A great weekend is planned and we hope to see you all there. We have a super silent auction and experienced clothing sale to add to the festivities. Of course, we will serve strawberry shortcake on Saturday night. See you in a square!
