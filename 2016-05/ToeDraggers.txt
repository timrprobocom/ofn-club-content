I hope you had a great first day of spring.  We welcomed in spring by dancing up a storm to gather and donate animal blankets, food and toys to the Bonnie Hays Small Animal Shelter.  Our special cuer, Bev Flint, and her husband Harlan are giving the club an extra night of just round dancing so we can practice, practice and practice some more.  They are so good to us. 
 We have nominated and voted in our new officers for the coming year. They’ll be taking over their responsibilities June 1st, 2016.  The Toes want to thank our current officers.  They have worked extra hard for our club this year and we appreciate them.
 Hope you received May flowers on May Day.  We are loving this time of the year.
 Dig out your crazy hat and racing gear for our May 6th dance.  It’s our Ready Set Go - Let’s Race Dance.  May 20th is a regular dance.  Think the Toes can be regular?  Knowing us, something will turn up to make you smile.
 We found out our Mystery trip is May 14th and we always look forward to a fun night with great friends.  Our fun caller KC with his wife Linda are planning it.  Now they can get back at us for all the sillies that we have done to them over the years.  See you in a square.
