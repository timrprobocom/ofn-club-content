R Square D had a dance the color of springtime, green, green, green.  On March 11th the festive St. Patrickâ€™s Day skirts and shirts came out of the closet for a Luck of the Irish dance at the Catlin Hall in Kelso.  The visiting club of Happy Hoppers took home a much deserved traveling banner. Thank you to Adam Christman for being our guest caller while Craig is away.  
 R Square D also wants to thank caller Jim Raupp for taking on the lessons during Craig's absence.  
 The monthly meeting was held at the hall with new officers elected; President - Vic Roberts, Vice President - Sharon Giles, Secretary - Chris Poole and Treasurer - Pat Faires.  Congratulations to all.  Thank you to our meeting hosts, Marvin and Barbara Wilburn.  
 May 13th finds the club sporting the bright colors of a Fiesta De Mayo Dance with Taco bar served before the dance at 6:00.  Please come and join in the fun.  Saturday May 28th is Memorial Day weekend and we will be dark.
