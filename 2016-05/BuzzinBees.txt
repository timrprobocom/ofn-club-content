Greetings from the Buzzin' Bees.  It is hard to believe that I am writing for the May edition already.  We have had 3 Plus lessons for our club and we are enjoying the change in format with our Workshop dance as our first Saturday dance of the month. It works well for K.C. to have a chance to clean up our bad habits and make us better dancers and I, for one, am enjoying his harmonica. If you need a tune up in your dancing, come join us the first Saturday of the month. Dress is casual. Plus lessons start at 6:00, pre - rounds at 7:30 and Mainstream at 8pm.

We will be getting Patriotic on 5/21/16 In preparation for Memorial Day so come and wear your red white and blue. We will have just 1 dance in June on 6/4 and it will be our annual end of the season BBQ with a Wild West theme. More information next month along with our new officers.  Enjoy your spring.
