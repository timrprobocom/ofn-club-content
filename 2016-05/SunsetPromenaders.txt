We have what we consider big news; we have changed our dance format to start the dance with plus level dance from 7:00 to 8:00 including intermediate rounds; and then 8:00 to 10:00 is mainstream dance level with phase two rounds.
 On March 12th we had a visitation to the River City Dancers with a good turnout of our club members. 
 We went dark on March 19th so the club could attended the Valley Squares 67th Anniversary Dance, and we had more than two squares of dancers attend.  It was a great dance with Chuck Garner and Randy Dibble calling and Connie Clark cueing.  Our caller Mike Stout called with Julie Stout and Ken Pratt cueing a tip too.  It was a fun dance with a full dance floor and dancers from many clubs attending.
 Our May 7th dance theme will be “Cinco de Mayo” dance with Darrell Kalmbach calling as our club caller Mike is on vacation, and Ken Pratt cueing.
 May 21st dance will be Mike Stout calling and Ken Pratt cueing.
 Our Promenaders Plus dances are May 5th and May 19th with Darrell Kalmbach calling and Ken Pratt cueing.  
 We really appreciate visitors, please come dance with us, and we will come dance with you, too.  It is more fun when we have a full dance floor both dancing and socially wise.
