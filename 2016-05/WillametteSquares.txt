Willamette Squares held their regular dance with the Easter theme, Eggstravaganza! Easter eggs were hidden all around the Square Dance Center, and everyone was encouraged to hunt for eggs in between tips and rounds. If you discovered the whereabouts of an egg, you were rewarded with prizes which were inside the plastic eggs. If you were lucky, you got chocolate! The refreshment table was laden with egg dishes: for eggsample, deviled eggs, quiche, and egg salad sandwiches. Everyone had an eggscellent time dancing! Hopefully everyone wasn't too eggshausted from all the fun to celebrate Easter the next day. Dancing with Willamette Squares is eggsactly where dancers can be every 4th Saturday evening at the Salem Square Dance Center! Jodee Howard
