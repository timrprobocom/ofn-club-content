The club seems to be clogging right along, no pun intended.  Ballots are presently being counted for election of officers to either continue or take over as of January 1, 2017.  We are also wrapping up our beginner class that started in September. We have 15 students in this class and they are doing a very fine job. They will be graduating just before Christmas, and hopefully, many of them will continue into the next phase of the beginner class after the first of the year.

We will be starting a second beginner class the first part of February 2017. This will be our second year of having lessons in February. Last year we had a number of people take part in this and it proved to be quite successful. Classes will be held as usual through the holiday season and we would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a very happy, healthy holiday season and blessings in the new year.
