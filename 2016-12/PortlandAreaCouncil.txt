The most surprising news of last month is that the Clark County Square Dance Center bumped our Tri-Council square dance.  It is evident that the CCSDC is not a dependable venue, and we need to start looking at other places to hold our larger dances.  â€&ldquo; places where our patronage is welcomed and revered.  Even in best case scenario, we will only have the CCSDC for a few more months.  A good person to contact would be Egan at: anthony.egan1@gmail.com

Meanwhile, our annual Christmas dinner will be held Dec 19 (in lieu of our usual meeting), 6:15, at the Spaghetti Factory on Sunnyside Road in Clackamas.  This will probably be the last year it will be there, as Tami Helms is exploring new venues.  All are welcome to attend.
