Our Seaside Sashay was October 21st and 22nd.  I want to thank everyone who came and enjoyed the weekend.  The weather was perfect so we were able to dance 2 hours at the Turnaround and 1 hour at the Factory Outlet plus the regular dancing at the Convention Center.  Some of the people who attended have come every year that we have been putting it on.  Thanks to the Sunset Promenaders, Gary and Joyce Clark, the Horses, the Hayshakers, Dale and Kathy Worthington, Cynthia Weber and Sylvia Davis.  Again thanks.  Also, there is a picture of the dancers at the Convention Center, the Turnaround, and in the sand.
