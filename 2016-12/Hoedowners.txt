Hoedowners wisely had their only dance of the month a themed Octoberfest Dance.  It was held on the 8th, fall leaves and sauerkraut certainly signal the fall season.  The rest of the month we enjoyed dancing at sponsored dances.  On the 22nd we went dark at the Aloha Grange to attend the Seaside Sashay.  Has it been three years in a row where the weather cooperated so there could be dancing at the turnaround? That is truly a unique experience and to think it’s the end of October.  It’s just a great weekend of fun on and off the dance floor and that’s why 24 Hoedowners attended.  We dined together Saturday night and had a post party following Saturday night’s dance.  Hoedowners never want to miss an opportunity to spend time together.  
 On the 29th we joined other dancers at the 5th Saturday Tri-Council dance.  Thank heavens, we just can’t waste a Saturday night!
 On December 10th we will be having our annual Toyland Dance where we bring a donation of an unwrapped toy or other gift for a child.  These are placed under the tree in the Grange and then donated to local families in need.
 Our classes are moving right along.  What a great group; folks who’ve never danced in a square to people returning after years away. I don’t think we’ve ever had new dancer’s pick up the calls so quickly and we’re anxious to get them to regular dances.  Our New Dancers Jamboree will be on December 11th, 1:30PM at the Aloha Grange.
 Not wanting to compete with old Saint Nicholas, the Hoedowners will be dark on December 24th.  Please enjoy the holiday with your children, grand children, and loved ones.
