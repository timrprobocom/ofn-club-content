Timber Twirlers are having a great season of dancing with lots of fun theme dances.
We had a movie and popcorn dance in October and caller Bruce Lowther kept the dancers guessing what  movies or TV shows the songs he played came from. 

In November we had a veteranâ€™s appreciation dance and everything pumpkin. In Dec we will have some holiday theme dances so look for our flyer. Come join the fun every first and third Fridays.

We have six new dancers in our class and they are having a great time. Sandy
