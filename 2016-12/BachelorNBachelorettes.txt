Visitation:  Oct 12 from Happy Hoppers.  Two other clubs tried for a visitation, but failed to come up with a one square minimum.  We feel honored that so many people come to visit us.

Winter heating bills can often cost a person a lot of money.  Square dancing is one of the most cost effective forms of exercise around.  But if you still find yourself broke, you should come to the B&B’s anyway.  Just ask our parking valet Parker Parkit for a loan.  He’s a pessimist and doesn’t expect to be repaid.
