The Tri Squares are enjoying fun and fellowship during the month of December.  During the month we have our Annual Christmas Dinner.  We look forward to seeing all our members at this event.  During the month of November, we had a new dancerâ€™s jamboree. The dance was held on Sunday, November 13th from 3:30 to 5:30. A big thank you to everyone who attended. 
 Starting in January, we will be starting the second set of our square dance lessons. These lessons are moves 51 to mainstream. We look forward to seeing you.
 Take Care,
  Leslie Woodland
