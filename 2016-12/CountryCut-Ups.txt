We were recently blessed by having our club featured in the Sandy Post in early November. This was unsolicited free advertising with pictures and a nice article. Just for the record though, Marc and Bev only have two children, not five. This article fits with our theme this year of trying to reach out to the community and have more awareness that we are there and what we do. Any time there is mention of square dancing in a newspaper, we all potentially benefit by this exposure.

We will be having our Club Christmas Party on December 10th with our annual gift exchange. This is always fun and a chance to get to know each other better. The next day on the 11th, we will host a new student level Jamboree at 1:30 to 4:00 PM. We have some great students in our mainstream class! December 31st is a 5th Saturday and New Yearâ€™s Eve, but due to poor attendance last year, and the numerous dances competing on this date, we have decided to go dark. So our third Saturday dance on Dec. 17th will be your last chance to dance at the Boring Barn in 2016, unless you want to come out and be an angel at our lessons on Thursday nights 7:30 to 9:30 PM.

Just a reminder that in January 2017, we will start dancing on 1st and 4th and 5th Saturdays. Unfortunately, the first time we are scheduled to dance on a 4th Saturday, it conflicts with Mid-Winter Festival, which is usually well attended by Cut-Ups, so we will be dark. On the third Saturdays, we will plan to do some visitations to club we have previously not been able to dance with, due to having the same schedule. Maybe we will show up at your club soon!

Happy Holidays!
