Salem Swingin' Stars have much to be Thankful for.  Our excellent Caller Randy Dibble, our extraordinary Cuer Jeanine Norden, the great group of club members who step up and pitch in and to our 15 new students dancing their way into our hearts: Thanks to all of you as we continue to be a vibrant club.
Our New Dancer Dance is Friday December 2. Pre-Rounds will start at 7:00 pm, Plus at 7:30 and then Class Level Mainstream with easy Rounds 8:00 pm - 10:15 pm.  Bring your new dancers and join us for a great evening of fun.  We will also have some Square Dance attire for sale for the new students or anyone interested in a new outfit.
December 16 will be our Regular Dance and December 30 will be a Plus Dance. Merry Christmas to All and a very Happy New Year. Sheila Machado
