The Wolf Pack is off to a great fall and winter season with our caller, Sandy Harris and cuer, Christina Corelli.  The new dancer class was invited to our Harvest Dance on November 5th and is also invited to our Holiday Dance on December 3rd.  And there is a Wednesday B51 dance (hosted by Wolf Pack) as part of the inter-club lesson committee on December 14th from 7 pm to 9 pm at the ESDC.  Lots of dancing fun for everyone.  We hope you will be able to join with us to share in the fun.
