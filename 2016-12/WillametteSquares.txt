Willamette Squares celebrated its birthday dance. Thank you to those who attended and helped us celebrate. It was a fun dance with a party mood and delicious birthday cake and ice cream. The end of November will be our annual Thanksgiving feast and dance. You won't want to miss an opportunity to acknowledge the many blessings we enjoy as we dance the night away.

Our club continues with round and square dance lessons. We are still in need of angels, so if you are available and willing, please join us on Sundays to lend a hand (and foot.)

We will be going dark on the fourth Saturday of December which is the 24th. On January 8, 2017 at 1:30 will be our New Dancer dance at the Salem Square Dance Center. Then the on January 28, Willamette Squares will again be dark because of Mid-Winter. We hope to see you all at our Thanksgiving and new dancer dances. Jodee Howard
