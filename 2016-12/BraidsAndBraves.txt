Wow, fall is here, with rains and wind predictions that forced us to cancel our October dance. Many of us attended the Mid-Willamette Area's Fall Festival Dance and had a great time, though.

Itâ€™s almost November and the Holiday Season and winter are approaching quickly, with lots of special dances and events. We hope you'll take time to visit us as part of your busy life. We'd love to see you!  Carmen
