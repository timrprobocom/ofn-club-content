Several of our members ventured to Sweet Home for the Turkey Dance with Jim Hattrick and Jackie Gale.  One of our members lives very close to the school. 
    Kris Jensen always does a fantastic job calling for us when she's in town.  Our November 19 special dance was a big hit with a fabulous potluck and incredible silent auction.  Kris Jensen's mom now lives in Eugene instead of Medford. 
    We are dark Christmas Day!  We will dance January 1 so come on out and join us for the first day of 2017! 5:30 - All levels!
    We wish everyone a Very Merry Christmas and may 2017 bring you many blessings!
 
Happy dancing, Christina Corelli
