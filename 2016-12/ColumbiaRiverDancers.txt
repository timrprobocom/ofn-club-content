I hate to tell our young dancers this, but as you get older, like in your 60's or 70's, the time seems to speed up.  It seems like just yesterday I was telling everyone about the Thanksgiving Burn-Off Dance we will be having the day after Thanksgiving with Dan Nordbye calling and Julie Stiers cuing.  By the time everyone reads this, it will almost be here.  Then comes December, which is what this edition is all about.  We will be having our Christmas Dance on December 10th with caller Mike Stout and cuing by Julie Stout.  It should be a wonderful way to wrap up the year.  
 Our second dance in December was to be on the 24th, but Santa comes that night and so we will be dark.  We just cannot out do the big guy.
 On behalf of all of the Columbia River Dancers, I want to wish everyone a Very Merry Christmas and the Best New Year ever.  Thanks to you all, you have made this year one to remember! See you in a square in 2017.
