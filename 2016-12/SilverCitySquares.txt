We had a good dance in October. even with all of the rain. A few River City Dancers braved the weather for a visitation and they retrieved their banners. We had a visitation to them the next evening and stole one back again.

We ended up with only one youth student this year and she decided she really wanted to wait another year to take lessons, so we ended up cancelling lessons for this year. But we are already working on getting the word out for lessons next year. Petrina Buchheit
