The UAC will be hosting our annual January New Dancer Dance January 20th in the
afternoon from 2:30 ‚Ä&ldquo; 5:00 pm.  We are excited to host the dance because it is a ‚ÄúLast Chance Dance‚Äù to come out and dance before heading to Albany for the Mid-Winter Festival. If you are a new dancer or have new dancers in your club that are feeling a little ‚Äúiffy‚Äù about dancing at Mid-Winter this is the perfect opportunity to get in some floor time. All of the calls will be at the new dancer level.  If you are an old hat at dancing, it will be a fun afternoon of dancing and a great way to get in one last dance before heading for Albany.  See our flyer for more info.
See you at Mid-Winter!
