The Charlie's are holding steady and having lots of fun dancing. Several dancers enjoyed the weekend up at Royal Romp and some went the next weekend to RIVCO, in Indio, CA.  A few of us will be heading over to the coast Nov 18-20th for the Fall Fling Round Dance Weekend. So much fun to be had!!!

Our next dance is November 19th, and we are hoping for lots of fun and a great turnout. We have a guest caller, Jim Steele, coming over from Prineville.  This dance will have all levels - Mainstream thru Advanced. There will not be any round dancing. Hope we see lots of friends!! Check out the flyer!

December 3rd, we are celebrating our 49th birthday!!  We have guest caller Richard Lane coming over to join us, and Bob Dingman will be doing rounds.  Richard is also going to do a special Plus workshop prior to the dance - from 2-4(ish). Come early and enjoy the challenge. Advanced will start at 600, and pre-rounds at 730. See the flyer for more info.  Come join us - the Charlie's always throw a great party!! 
Our 3rd Saturday dance, on the 17th, will feature our regular caller Ray Holmes, with Bob Dingman on the rounds.  This is our Plus/A1 dance.

Our September class celebrated their 1st plateau and had lots of fun. The class is always full of smiles, and we are doing our best to encourage the fun!!
We are gearing up for new classes starting in January. As always, the first 3 classes are free. 1st class is January 12, 2017.  We are also continuing with our A1 class - we have a nice core group learning about the fun of dancing advanced. We even have a couple coming down each week from Roseburg. They have been a fun addition to our group! 

Since this will be published before the holidays - we want to wish everyone a very Happy Thanksgiving!!

We hope to see you in a square soon!!!
