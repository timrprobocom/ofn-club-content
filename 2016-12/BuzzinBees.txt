Happy holidays from the Buzzin' Bees! We hope this finds you having a happy and healthy December.

Yes, it is cold, dark and wet but the Bees plan to celebrate "Christmas in Hawaii " and we invite you to join us on December 17th. KC Curtis will be joined by Bill Lundin to call and Debbie Combs will cue. Debbie is getting ready to retire and travel with her husband so we will be losing her at the end of January. We dance at the Hazel Dell Grange with pre-rounds @ 7:30 and squares @8.

Lessons are going well. We have a lively group of students and have started to invite them to dances where we do a class level tip and then a mainstream tip.

By the time you read this we will have had our "Giving Thanks" dance where we take in a collection of personal care items and deliver them to several Assisted living facilities that serve a high number of low income seniors.I want to thank all who donate. It makes such a huge impact on their lives.

 Merry Christmas
