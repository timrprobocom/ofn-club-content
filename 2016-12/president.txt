<p>Holiday time is just around the corner. Food, family, and traditions are all coming to take some of our time. I am hoping that you will take time to put dancing in your schedule also. It will take away the stress of deadlines and give you some time away from the wrapping paper, meal planning, and school vacations that are also just weeks away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encourage the new dancers to attend the new dancer dances, jamborees and holiday dances so they can get the experience of regular dances and meeting other new dancers that are getting the same lessons they are. They can compare notes, hear other callers/cuers other than their own instructor, and they will be able to gauge how they are doing and can go back to their instructor and comment on what they learned by attending the dance. The instructor can make any adjustments needed so their next dance experience is a better one. We want them to succeed and enjoy the overall aura of friendship set to music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; January will bring about Mid-Winter Festival and the collection of names for potential candidates for Federation office. Look in your state directory and search for the nomination committee members and get your name and nomination form submitted to one of them for inclusion on the ballot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does your club have a charity to which it donates either funds or goods? Has your club done anything yet during the year to benefit someone else who may need what you have to offer to them? Let me know what your club or area does. I am interested in learning what others do to share the bounty.</p>
<p>From the Federation to all of you,</p>
<p>Merry Christmas and be safe when driving to and from an event</p>
