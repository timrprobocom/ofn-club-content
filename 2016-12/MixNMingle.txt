At our Halloween dance we had an unexpected lighting effect.  That was the day when rain had been so heavy.  A downstairs pipe had come unattached, and the resulting problem had to be taken care of, fortunately, before the dance started.
 It was upstairs that the surprise effect showed.  Only one set of lights came on for the dance.  Luckily, the other rooms had their regular lights functioning properly.  The dancers seemed quite undaunted by dim lights and continued to dance with enthusiasm.  It was a little tougher on Randy and Jeanine trying to provide the music under difficult circumstances. 
 We look forward to our Canned Food Dance December 17 when the stage will be decorated with lots of canned food donations for the food bank to distribute to the hungry.
