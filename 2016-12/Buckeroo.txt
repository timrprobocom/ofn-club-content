Here at the Barn, fall has set in! The leaves are falling and it is beginning to look like Thanksgiving. This past month the students in lessons have learned so much that they are ready for new dancer dances and jamborees! 

Our dances this month were lots of fun. During our first dance this month, we celebrated our Veterans with a Red, White, and Blue theme. Everyone was decked out in their best outfits as we danced the night away. Our second dance was our Thanksgiving Feast. The barn provided the turkey and we all brought side dishes to share. The first hour of the evening dance was devoted to our students with beginning level dances.

We also joined up together to dance/walk in the Roseburg Veteranâ€™s Day Parade. We dressed up in red, white, and blue and celebrated those who have served our country. A great time was had by all.

We have started our largest fundraiser of the year, so stay tuned for details. The Buckeroos have the best holiday wreaths that you can find in Oregon. If you are interested in purchasing one to decorate your home this holiday season, please contact us.

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
