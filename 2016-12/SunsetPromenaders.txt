The Annual Seaside Sashay was at the Seaside Convention Center Friday October 21st and Saturday the 22nd this year with Ray Brendzy and Richard Lane as the callers and cuer Debbie Taylor.  We had 200-dancers attend; Friday the weather was nice but Saturday the weather was just beautiful.  Ray, Richard, and Debbie did a great job of calling and cueing, it was a great festival, with of a couple of big split the pots, Friday night $89, and Saturday $149!  Some of the events included dancing at the Turnaround on Saturday and we had ten squares dancing there, also six squares at the Outlet Mall during the day.  And of course there was the mud wrestling event, and we danced in the hall a lot too.  There were dancers from Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and other places, too.
 October 1st the Sunset Promenaders had our 32nd Anniversary Dance. 11 squares danced mainstream and Plus with calling by Dan Preedy from Spokane. Our own Ken Pratt did his usual excellent cueing.  The evening started out at 6:30 with a full dinner meal featuring pulled pork, and the famous “Donna’s rolls”.  Then the pre-rounds started at 7:30 and mainstream dance at 8:00 until 10:00 with dessert break after.  We appreciate all the visitors from many different clubs in the area.  The visitors made it a special dance with a full floor and a chance to visit with all our old and new friends.  Thank you.
 In December our dance theme is all about Christmas of course.
