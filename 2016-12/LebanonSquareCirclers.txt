We had a great "Black Light" dance in October with four squares. It is always fun to see how the white shows up in the light. Charlotte Jeskey called and Jackie Gale cued. Our next dance will be a Sports Night Dance where dancers may wear apparel that represents their favorite team.  
 
This month is a busy month for our club to go visiting. In November we will be helping the Sweet Home Squarenaders celebrate at their Turkey Dinner Dance with Jim Hattrick calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  It is always a super dance with dinner being served prior to the dance.  

On November 19th our club is going dark so that we can dance with the Braids and Braves to Dan Nordbye.  
   
Then we have our Toy Dance on the first Saturday in December. We are also getting ready for our 68thBirthday celebration.  See you in a square!  Marilyn York
