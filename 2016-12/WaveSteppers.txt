The Wave Steppers’ square dance classes are “dark” the month of December.  Like we did last year, we’re taking a hiatus between Thanksgiving and New Year’s.  The free Wednesday night classes at the Tillamook Elks lodge, taught by club caller Joe Wrabek, will resume January 4th.
 The Club has a tentative lineup for the 2017 Dance Season.  Club caller Joe Wrabek and line dance instructor Gwen Kiel will be doing the club dances in March (3/11), May (5/13), August (8/12), and October (10/14).  In April, we’ll have Jim Hattrick calling and cueing; in July, it will be Harvey Hunsucker calling and Cueing; and in September, our Anniversary Dance will feature “Caller Elvis” (Mark Wheeler) and cuer Connie Clark.  (The caller and cuer for the Club’s June 10th dance aren’t confirmed yet as this is written.)
 The Wave Steppers’ dances are held at Garibaldi City Hall, 107 Sixth St. (at Acacia).  About two-thirds of the building’s second floor is a dance floor, and the Club has reportedly square danced there since the building was built in 1948.
