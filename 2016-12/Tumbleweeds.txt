What a fun Halloween dance we had!   Many clever costumes and great calling by Jim Hattrick.  Of course the food was fantastic. More fun holiday dances are being planned: Thank giving with turkey and all the trimmings, Christmas and even New Years dance.  Check our flyers for dates, callers and cuers.  Don't forget, we have great parking in our parking lot.
