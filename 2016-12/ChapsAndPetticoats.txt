Silver City Squares in Silverton hosted their Thanksgiving Fest. dinner and dance on November 11th - the Chaps and Petticoats was there and took home, unexpectedly, the Silverton banner...yeah!

A few of us Chaps attended the Seaside Sashay on October 22nd.   It was entertaining and  full of humor with Ray Brendzy and Richard Lane as Callers and Debbie Taylor too.  Thank you to the Hayshakers and Sunset Promenaders for a well enjoyed event. 

We welcome all to join the Chaps & Petticoats on December 2nd with Scott Zinser and Sandra Pinion as Caller/Cuer.  On December 16th George Hermann and Ken Pratt will end our 2016 year of dances and put us in the Christmas spirit...join us.

How unbelievable that this year is almost over!  Have a joy-filled Christmas and a blessed New 2016 Year!
