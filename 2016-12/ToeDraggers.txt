The Toe Draggers square dance class is off to a great start.  Our students are really moving through the material and are mastering the moves. They will be ready for their jamboree on November 20th, and hope other clubs will be able to join us.  Club angels are encouraging the students to attend other jamborees and are planning on going with them.  Our resale clothing will start next week and continue into December.  Guests are welcome to purchase items, too.
 The Toe Draggers will be celebrating the Christmas season during both December dances.  On Friday, December 2nd, we will hold our “Deck the Halls” dance.  The festivities start at 7:30 pm with round dancing with Bev followed by our mainstream dance with rounds at 8:00 pm.  Our students are encouraged to attend the first hour of the dance where tips will be called to their level.  A plus tip will be also called during the evening.  On Friday, December 16th, we will host a special holiday dance, “We Wreath You a Merry Christmas”.  The dancing starts at 7:30 pm with pre-plus with KC followed by our mainstream dance with rounds.  The Toes will be collecting new, unwrapped toys during both of their December dances.  The toys will be donated to area youth who are in need.
 Bev Flint will be starting her Round Dance lessons on January 8th at the Kinton Grange at 2:00 pm.  Lessons will start with Two-Step, followed by Waltz in a few weeks.
