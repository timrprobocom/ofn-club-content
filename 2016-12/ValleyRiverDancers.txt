In November we launched our students off to jamborees and new dancer dances. It is so much fun to see them gain skills every week while having a blast learning to square up with our intrepid angels. Our new dancers' dance is December 23, and we hope to welcome newbies from many clubs not only in the council, but also from all clubs in the greater Portland/Salem area. 

Late in November, in fact the day after Thanksgiving, we host our annual Gospel Dance, which is always a hit. Then the following evening, we are supporting our caller, Randy Dibble, and his wife Sharon, in hosting a benefit dance for  family members in the Philippines who are struggling to recover from two typhoons that wiped out everything they had. The dance will be Saturday, November 26 at 7:30 at the Fairfield Grange on River Road south of St. Paul. It is mainstream with every third tip plus, with rounds between tips. Cash donations gratefully accepted at the door. 

And last, but not least, you're invited to our annual New Year's Eve celebration at Maplewood Grange in Aurora. Beginning at 8:00 pm, we will dance plus with every third tip A2. 

Our flyers have all the details about these upcoming events. We hope you will join us.
