Hello everyone, and Happy Holidays as the days roll by to Christmas and New Year’s. 
We have been busy with Fox Trot and Tango workshops, getting into the more difficult, higher level, phase 4 moves. We had a Halloween party of just dancing and no workshops. It gave us an idea how we are doing and what moves we still need work on.
We are dark on Thanksgiving and on December 22nd and 29th to allow for the Christmas and New Year’s holidays and all the preparations that need to be done. We will rest and deal with the details and figure out what we are doing for another rhythm after the first of the year.
We are dancing on New Year’s Eve with our club cuer, Cheryl Manley and additional cuers, Ken Pratt and David Vomocil, to make for a joyous evening of dancing and friendship. Come and join us, dress up, and enjoy an evening of dancing Phase 3-4 and some Phase 5. A little bit of everything for all. Marilyn Schmit
