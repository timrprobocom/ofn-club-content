October 14th was our second time of enjoying Jim Hattrick as our new club caller for the 2nd Friday of each month. Mark Wheeler, also a caller from the Portland area, rode down with Jim and we enjoyed one tip he called and one tip that they called together.  We are also very lucky to have Jackie Gale as our full time club cuer and, as always, her cueing was great.Towards the end of the dance Jim workshopped "Daisy Chain," a call from years past. After many attempts all the squares finally figured out which direction to go as we proceeded through the call. Great fun!

October 28th was our annual Halloween costume dance with Scott Zinser calling and Jackie Gale cueing.  Always fun to see so many club members, as well as guests in great costumes. Everyone that came through the door was handed a ballot to vote on their favorite costume choices in each category and prizes were awarded at break-time. Scott and Jackie called and cued a great dance and a fun time was had by all.

Single Trees (as part of the inter-club lesson committee) is hosting the first Wednesday B51 dance from 7 pm to 9 pm on Nov. 16th at the ESDC - hope you get this in time to come and support our new dancers!.
 
December 9th is our Christmas dinner (at 6:30 pm) and dance (starting at 7:30 pm). Single Trees will supply the meat (leaning toward ham) and rolls. Anyone who is planning on attending please bring potluck food no later than 6:15 p.m. so we can eat on time in order to dance on time. It would be much appreciated. Jim Hattrick will be doing the calling for this dance.  We hope to see many of our friends from other clubs attend the dance.
