Please join us for our "Christmas is Coming Dance" December 3rd and our "Santa Dance" December 17th at Aloha Grange.
 We had a quiet October.  Many of us celebrated the Sunset Promenaders Anniversary, for which Valley Squares had gone dark.  We also had fun dancing with the Tualatin Timbers Squares at our monthly visitation.
 Dancing to Scott Bennett, a National caller from Oklahoma was the highlight of our month.  He has a great voice and his choreography is fun and innovative.  We felt very fortunate to have him as guest caller at our October 15th dance.
 Our Mastering Mainstream lessons are transitioning to Plus this month.  Join us on Tuesday nights.
