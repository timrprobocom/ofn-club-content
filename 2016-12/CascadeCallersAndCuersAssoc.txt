We had our fall dance October 29 and had several of our members (including our new members) call and cue.  We missed Kirby Goode who is not well and home on oxygen.  We pray he feels better soon.  Lennie Ludiker hurt his back helping his sister move.  Always something it seems.  We were happy to have several of our members present for our Fifth Saturday Dance.  Our association is growing with new callers and cuers.

 CCCA is sponsoring this year's New Year's Eve dance.  Roger Putzler will be the caller, and Christina Corelli will cue.  The cost will be $2.50 as that was the cost of square dancing back in the 80's.  So, plan to join us December 31.  8:30 - Pre-Rounds and 9:00 - Squares  We dance at the Emerald Dance Center at 2095 Yolanda in Springfield.  Please come and help us issue in 2017!
 
See ya in a square,
Christina Corelli, Cuer / Secretary of CCCA
