We want to thank all of the dancers who attended the Mid-Willamette Area first New Dancers Dance which we had the honor of hosting right after Thanksgiving.

Our second dance in December will be our Christmas dance and, as usual, we will hold our silent auction (the proceeds going to support our charity).  In addition to said proceeds, our club members will take this opportunity to collect cans of decaffeinated coffee to supply to the Windsor House. A new twist for our Christmas Dance this year will be holding our Candy Cane (pole) Dance for which the participants will receive a special dangle. Happy Dancing!  Linda Neuschwander
