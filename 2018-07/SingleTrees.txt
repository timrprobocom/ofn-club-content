Summer arrived early this year.  May while sunnier than most years has been a rather quiet month for Single Trees with the exception of our second Friday dance May 11.  That night we combined with our sister club, the Whirl-A-Ways, to host our annual Mexican Fiesta Dance with our traditional lavish taco bar.  Everything went well with George Hermann calling as well as last minute substitute Darrell Kalmbach.  Jackie Gale cued a nice variety of rounds.  Mike Kious was scheduled to call with his grandfather but was unable to come due to back problems and a bad reaction to a medication.  We hope he has fully recovered by now.   George and Darrell made a great team.  We sure enjoy getting the chance to dance to Darrellâ€™s fine calling.  The crowd of dancers made short work of the taco bar which let us all renew our energies and get back to dancing.

Some Single Trees showed up to help give the Emerald Square Dance Center a good cleaning the day after we danced our feet off.  The hall always looks good after these clean up sessions.  All the clubs were represented, but we must admit that the Whirl-A-Ways are far more represented.  We thank everyone for their good efforts.

Single Trees decided to go dark for Memorial Day weekend so there was no second dance in May.

We will be dancing all summer with Jim Hattrick calling our second Friday dances July 13 and Aug. 10; we will be dark for Diamond Lake July 27.  Terry Halley will be our caller Aug. 24.  We hope to see some of you at our summer dances on your way to or from one of the many summer festivals around the Northwest and elsewhere.

Happy summer dancing!
