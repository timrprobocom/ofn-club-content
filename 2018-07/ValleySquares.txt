Please join us for our dances July 7th, called by Scott Zinser, and July 14th, called by Dan Nordbye.  Connie Clark will cue both dances.  Aloha Grange is air-conditioned!
 We ended the month of May by joining dancers from Valley River, Sunset Promenaders, Toe Draggers, and Valley Squares meeting for a flash dance at the Oregon City City Hall parking lot.  We then headed over to Oak Grove for pizza, salad, and cookies, followed by a lively dance called by Dan Nordbye, with guest tips by KC Curtis.  Cueing was done by Julie Stiers, with Ken Pratt, Connie Clark and Bev Flint each taking turns for the Rounds.  Before the four clubs joined forces, Valley Squares and Sunset Promenaders rode the Oregon City elevator and visited famous Oregon pioneer and civic leader, Dr. McLoughlin's home while Valley River and Toe Draggers danced in a real barn.
 Valley Squares has added an hour of Mainstream Lessons before our Saturday dances, so join us at 6:00 to polish those skills or refresh the ones you recently learned.  We are averaging a couple of squares of students and about that many for our Cinco de Mayo and Cowboy Roundup dances following the Saturday lessons.
