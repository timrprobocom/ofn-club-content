After the "stepping down" of our beloved instructor for so many years, Cheri Posedale, the club has kind of finally stabilized. Glee Johnson teaches our 4:00 class, Grace Allen teaches our 5:30 beginning class and Stacie Larson has been doing our intermediate advanced class. If she is unable to be there then Moya or Glee fill in. All have been doing a fine job. 

We are presently working hard on preparing for our summer demo season. We will be dancing at World Beat June 30, the Marion County Fair July 12, Bush Barn Art Fair July 21 & 22, Silverton Art Fair Aug. 18 and the Oregon State Fair on September 1.  

Attendance has pretty much stayed consistent.  We have anywhere from 10-15 at any of the three classes most Tuesdays. We will be scheduling our semi-annual summer meeting soon and planning for our lessons to start again in September. Come check us out if you'd like to find out what clogging is all about and want some great exercise. Georganne Pfnister
