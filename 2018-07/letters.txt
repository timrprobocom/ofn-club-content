<li><a>Thanks from Christina Corelli</a>
<div>
<div>Thank you dancers</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A huge thank you to all of you who kept Kirby and me too, in their thoughts and prayers while Kirby was on 'in home' hospice since the fall of 2016.&nbsp; Kirby was on several prayer chains and lists.&nbsp; People sent e-mails, cards and visited Kirby while he was on hospice.&nbsp; It made a difference as Kirby was so lonesome being bedridden. Several folks stayed with Kirby so I could shop, cue, teach classes, etc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When Kirby passed away, the outpouring of love and support was amazing and appreciated more than you could ever know.&nbsp; &nbsp;E-mails and cards came from everywhere.&nbsp; The memorial for Kirby June 9 was actually fun.&nbsp; Wes Weathers, a former square dancer, provided a Color Guard, presenting of the flag and flag salute which provided a nice touch of honor and patriotism.&nbsp; Roger Putzler manned the sound and microphone for sharing which was upbeat, and folks, including me, learned things about Kirby.&nbsp; One of Kirby's best friends, Tom Gregersen, welcomed everyone to the service, made remarks and gave the invocation.&nbsp; Our pastor, David Bondurant from the First Christian Church in Junction City, closed with the benediction and provided instructions on what to do next.&nbsp; He also took photos. Janet Geiger, who Kirby was helping to learn to call, did Crawdad Hole, a singing call from Kirby's collection.&nbsp; Christina cued Turn Your Radio On.&nbsp; There was a huge potluck and people looked at photo boards and memorabilia.&nbsp; ORDTA had sent a huge beautiful bouquet that was displayed on the entrance table.&nbsp; Floyd Bard brought 50 additional chairs from the Elks.&nbsp; Single Trees had their dance the night before and put chairs out on the dance floor for the service.&nbsp; Thank you Single Trees. A big thank you to folks who took care of the door, the potluck, cleaning up, etc.&nbsp; Kirby's caregiver, Jake Westra, went to his brother's afterwards. His brother asked him how it went&nbsp; Jake's reply was "I had FUN!"&nbsp; Kirby would have loved it!&nbsp; Everyone had a name badge or hard badge and mingled and shared.&nbsp; Yes, this was truly a celebration of Kirby Goode's life.&nbsp; There was close to 300&nbsp; in attendance.&nbsp; Thank you so much one and all.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Much love,</div>
