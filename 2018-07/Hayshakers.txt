The Hayshakers want to thank all of you who came to our Anniversary Dance in May.  We had over 6 squares.  The old grange hasnâ€™t had that much jumping around in a long time and it was wonderful.  The Hoedowners had a beach weekend and they brought a couple squares to the dance for about an hour.  Also, the Sunset Promenaders came and helped us celebrate.  Thank you one and all.
 The Seaside Sashay is coming up fast.  The dance weekend will be October 26th and 27th.  Everyone seems to have fun and we expect everyone to have a good time this year as well.  Call if there are any questions, Sylvia 503-325-8109 or Joyce Clark 503-647-5742.
