We continue to dance Sunday nights from 5:30 - 8:00 at all levels with our competent caller and teacher, Tim Matteson.  We encourage dancers to come dance with us and get more floor time.  Please call our president, David Lajoie at 541-520-7311 or Tim at 541-988-0399 to make sure we are dancing as we go dark once in a blue moon.  We don't want to miss you.  Our dances/classes are always casual.  We always have a lot of food too.  Come for a fun evening almost every Sunday!

Kirby Goode was one of our members, and we miss him and keep Christina and families in our thoughts and prayers.  We used to have our board meetings at Kirby's and Christina's home while Kirby was still able to come out to the family room.  He enjoyed being with us for the meetings. When Kirby became bed ridden we had to have meetings elsewhere.  Kirby is missed by us all.

Happy dancing!
