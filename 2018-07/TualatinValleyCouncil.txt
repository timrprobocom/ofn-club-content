Memorial Day was on the fourth Monday in May which resulted in the cancellation of the scheduled TVC meeting, so there is no Council news to report.
 The Hayshakers 66th Anniversary dance was held on May 18th in Warrenton with over 6 squares attending.  According to Sylvia Davis, the old grange had not seen that many dancers in a long time and "it was wonderful!".  Let's continue to promote and support all anniversary dances as they start again in September.  The clubs have really appreciated the attendance dancers have shown.
 Since the OFN is published mid month, you may still have time to plan on the 5th Saturday, June 30th TVC dance.  It is a very special dance with a very different format, a Mainstream to Advance event at the Aloha Grange, Scott Zinser calling and Jeanine Norden cueing.  The format is: 1 hour Mainstream & Level 2-3 Rounds w/Plus intro, followed by 1 hour Plus & Level 3-5 Rounds w/Advanced intro.  This dance is co-hosted by the Valley Squares.
 The next TVC event will be the annual Hahn Barn Dance on Sunday, August 12th.  More details next month.
