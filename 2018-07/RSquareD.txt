 May 11th was our Fiesta de Mayo dance.  Many señors and señoritas enjoyed a taco bar dinner before "dancing it off" the rest of the evening.  Our stellar Caller and Cuer, Craig Abercrombie and Lonnie Sykes know just how to create a festive dance atmosphere.  Thank you to those who joined us.  On May 26th we were dark for the Memorial Day weekend.
 Remember our summer schedule through August changes to 2nd and 4th WEDNESDAYS.  Same times: 7:00pm - 8:00 pm Plus and 8:00 pm - 10:00 pm Mainstream with rounds.  Summer dances are all casual.
 July 11th- "Surf's up!"  It'll be cool in our air conditioned hall, and sundaes for break...remember I promised ice cream for summer dances.  Dances are casual so break out the Hawaiian attire for our Hawaiian dance July 25th.  Darrell Kalmbach is our guest Caller and our dynamic Cuer Lonnie Sykes has a good repertoire of Hawaiian music.  I hear root beer floats will be the after-dance treat.
 Look for fall lessons on Monday nights in October after our big Octoberfest weekend 12th-14th at Rose Valley Grange, Kelso. 
 R Square D dances at the Kelso Senior Center, Kelso/Longview WA.  For more information about us please visit our website at www.r-square-d.info or friend us on Facebook.  Our caller is Craig Abercrombie and our cuer is Lonnie Sycks.
