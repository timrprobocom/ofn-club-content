We had a great Alien Days Dance. Check out the photo on our Facebook page. We had guests from several clubs and three squares on the floor.

Our club won the trophy at Hillsboro Hoedowners' Trophy Dance recently-visiting other clubs has benefits!  We'll be planning our own Trophy dance for this fall since we'll be dark July and August.

We will participate in area events and plan a Camp-out near Vernonia in July and a Community Dance in August. Carmen
