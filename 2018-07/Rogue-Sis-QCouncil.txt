Hi Everyone,

Summer Festival is a memory now. All went well and everyone had a great time. The Bear Hun was especially well received by the kids and their parents. This gave everyone from out of town a tour of Grants Pass. Thank you, Blake.

The 5th Friday Council dance will be on June 29, in Grants Pass with Wayne Weaver calling and Elaine Funk cueing. This will be the last time Wayne will call a council dance before he retires, that is, unless we can catch him on the fly for a dance in the future.

Things are in place for the next "Fountain of Youth" dance on July 6, 2018. Dean Black, from Yreka, will be the caller. It will be at the Fruitdale Grange in Grants Pass from 530 to 8pm. If you bring a "non-dancer" or rather a "potential" new dancer, you will be admitted free.

Pease note: our meeting place has changed. Starting in August, we will be meeting at Round Table Pizza in Poplar Square.

PLEASE support the Council and the Clubs in the Rogue Valley. Everyone needs all the support they can get. Times are "skinny", so, please come out and help by supporting your local clubs. We don't want to lose any clubs because of non-support from the dancers.

The next council meeting will be August 7, 2018 at Round Table Pizza in Poplar Square at 430pm.

Lois & Lorri
