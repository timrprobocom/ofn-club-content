Summer is here and for us in Douglas County that means the County Fair is “just around the corner.” Think about penciling in the fair dates of August 7-11 on your calendar and come and join us on the dance floor.  The Fair board has reinstated the fair beginning on Tuesday instead of Wednesday for fair week so we have an extra night of fun dancing available beginning on August 7th. As always, square dance attire is required to be on the dance floor and because square dancers wearing square dance attire get into the fair free as a “thank you” for show casing square dancing, all dancers need to plan to be dancing during the 7:00pm –9:00pm  time slot.  Make a day or evening of it and come early or stay late and enjoy the fair and all of the exciting things going on at the fair before or after the square dancing.  See the flyer for more info. 
If you are coming from out of town, give us a call in case there are any last minute changes.
