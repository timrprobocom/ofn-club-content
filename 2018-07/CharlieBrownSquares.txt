What a wonderful time we all had at Boatnik Festival with the fabulous Tony Oxendine & Sharon(Casey) Parker...Oh My Goodness...what a PARTY!!!! We had a lot of visitors from all over Oregon....and beyond. We are so thankful for each & every visitor!!! It was so much FUN!!!!!!!  The committee did a wonderful job putting everything together. We are a small group - but I think we all did a great job...so thank you!!  Planning is under way for 2019 Festival with Joe Saltel & TJ(Bruce) Chadd!!!

Our January class graduated with 4 students and we look forward to having them continue and join our dance community!! 
Please welcome them when they come to dance with you!

June 2nd we had special guest caller Terry Halley and cuer Steve Murphy. It was quite the "circus", and everyone had a great time.  Charlie's were dark June 16th for GoldDiggers dance in Yreka.  We are getting ready for Summer Festival here in Grants Pass. This is hosted by the Council, with all 4 clubs participating in the planning etc. We hope there will be lots of visitors dancing to some wonderful callers & cuers!!

Our next dance is going to be a biggie!!!! National caller Bronc Wise will visit and it's going to be a wonderful day/evening, with lots of events happening throughout the day!!!
230-4pm Bronc will do an Advanced Workshop. At 6pm, we will have Advanced dancing. At 730pm Rikki Lobato will cue Pre Rounds and then we will dance the night away from 8-1030!!!  I know of several visitors coming, so let's fill up the hall!!!  

We are dark in August; but there are lots of dances to attend during that time, so we will definitely stay busy!  We will start class in September and look forward to a great turnout!! No club dances in September, due to Labor Day Weekend and Circle N Square's birthday!!

Lots of fun stuff happening, and look forward to seeing lots of smiling dancers at as many events as possible!!

Happy Dancing!!!
