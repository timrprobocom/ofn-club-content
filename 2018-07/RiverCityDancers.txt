On June 9, 2018, River City Dancers celebrated their 28th anniversary with an anniversary dance. It was a great celebration and honored all the past presidents of our club. Our club has an interesting history which began in 1989 when Rose City Squares and Barn Owls discussed the possibility of merging into one club. The merger was completed in 1990 and River City dancer was born. Our club began as a couples club , but today we welcome all dancers both singles and couples to attend our dances and to join our club.

For the past month we have been trying out a new dance time schedule to see how members liked it and at our last meeting the new time for our dances was adopted. We will still be dancing every second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community Center on 42nd and Jackson, .Only the dance times have changed. We are now dancing to this schedule:
7-7:30 plus with rounds 
7:30- 9:30 Mainstream 
Break at 9:30 and ending after break.

Our hall is air conditioned and we dance all summer.  We love having company . Hope you will come dance with us.
