The Roaring Twenties Koast Krash in Yachats was a roaring success – Special thanks to the Koast Krash Committee (Terry McCarty, Celinda Gourley, and Bill & Marsha Francis) for an outstanding job.  And double thanks to Bill Francis and his helpers for washing the dishes – a big job which was much appreciated.  Included in the festivities was a surprise birthday party for Ron Minten during which he was showered with many gift “treasures”. We are already looking forward to next year’s Koast Krash at the Yachats Inn April 25 – 29.
