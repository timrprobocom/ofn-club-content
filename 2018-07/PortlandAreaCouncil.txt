Weâ€™re selling one of our two trailers meant for parades and such.  For anyone or any club interested, you can email our trailer wranger Betty at chippsbetty@gmail.com.

We hope to see you at our council dance June 29, with Mark Wheeler calling and Molly Combs cueing.  This will be at the Oak Grove Community Club (see flyer).
