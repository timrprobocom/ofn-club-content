Summer is here, and July 7th we will be dark.  Come prepared July 21st to enjoy our annual Root Beer Float Dance.  Our third and last special summer dance will be the Watermelon Dance August 18th.  By the time you read this, our Red, White, and Blue Dance will be past.
 We wish to thank all the dancers who showed up to angel our classes.  They have been truly angels, and we appreciate all that they do.
 This term as president Lindie Noonan has thought of a way to make introductions more interesting and worth paying full attention to.  At the beginning of the dance she will ask Randy two or three rapid fire questions.  At break she will give some M 'n M history.  How many of you know how many or the original members are still members?  Those who know Lindie know that she will make it fun, as well as informative.
