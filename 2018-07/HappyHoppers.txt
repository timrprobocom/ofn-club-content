Can you believe it?  Summer is here and another dance year filled with memories of friendships made, fellowship shared, and of course, great dancing has come to a close. As always, the Hoppers will be dark for July and August.  However, starting in September we’ll be back with renewed enthusiasm in our new location.  The decision about which of the two very fine venues we are exploring will be made, and we will be ready to welcome all of our square dancing friends to our new home.  We’ll keep you posted about the new location as soon as the final decision is made.

	When we resume dancing in September, we anticipate experiencing the same activities that have become important to our club members:  dining out once a month, angeling new students in the mainstream and plus levels, visiting other clubs and dancing together with all of our square dance friends.  In the meantime, you can expect to see Hopper members in many places throughout the summer.  Some of our members participate in the River City Riders and will be traveling to Kansas City Missouri to perform; others are planning to be at summer festivals throughout Oregon and Washington.  We’re looking forward to seeing you in a square somewhere.
