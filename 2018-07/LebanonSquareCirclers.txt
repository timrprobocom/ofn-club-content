June 1st, 2nd, and 3rd was a great weekend in Lebanon. It was a glorious Strawberry Festival and the weather was perfect. We gathered on Thursday evening at Marilyn's home for potluck and to decorate the float for the parade on Saturday. On Friday, RVs arrived and club members worked hard to set up and decorate the Senior Center for all the activities, including a Spaghetti Feed that night (chaired by Barb and Rosalie). Our Trails End Dance featured callers and cuers from the floor with Charlotte Jeskey and Jackie Gale as MCs. Thousands of people lined the streets as we danced throughout the parade on Saturday morning. We had Andy Garboden from Kent, WA as our Festival caller and Jackie Gale as cuer.  Andy grew up in Lebanon, so it was a thrill to welcome him as our guest caller.  Of course we served strawberry shortcake at the break. Other highlights of the festival were a fabulous silent auction (chaired by Kaynor Heineck) and a great experienced clothing sale (chaired by Grace Christensen).  Our weekend concluded with an "All You Can Eat" Pancake breakfast on Sunday morning.  (See pictures.)
 
Our club goes dark for July and August, but there are many opportunities for dancing, such as the Pioneer Picnic Dance in Brownsville on June 16.  Our mainstream lessons begin on September 16. See you in a square! Marilyn York
