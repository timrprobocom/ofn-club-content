Willamette Squares is making plans for the summer. We will be continuing our regular dances at the Salem Square Dance Center on the fourth Saturday of every month.
 We enjoyed our May dance with a Veterans Day theme. Everyone in attendance received a pin of two American Flags crisscrossed over each other. Sandy Harris, our caller, chose a number of patriotic songs. With the decorations and attire of red, white and blue, they set the stage for the tribute to our veterans.
On a personal note, Vince and Babs Till have moved to Mt. Angel Towers. They enjoy keeping in touch and hearing from friends.
 We invite everyone to come dancing with us. We enjoy everyoneâ€™s company and always have fun!  Steve Hoots (for Jodee Howard)
