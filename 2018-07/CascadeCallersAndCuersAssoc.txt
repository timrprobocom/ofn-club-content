Our next scheduled dance is June 30.  We'll have a CCCA meeting at 6:30 with our new officers in charge.  President - Pat Cox, Vice-President - Jackie Gale, Secretary - Christina Corelli, Treasurer - Gail Jackson. .  Pre-Rounds are from 7:30 - 8:00 and then it's squares and rounds called and cued by our members.  The dance ends at 10:00.  We look forward to calling and cueing for you and dancing too!  It'll be FUN!

Then our next scheduled dances are September 29 and December 29.  We'll have to decide whether or not we'll actually have a dance December 29 since New Year's Eve is just a couple of days later. .

We are so sorry to lose one of our members, Kirby Goode on May 14, 2018.  Kirby had been on hospice since November of 2016.  Kirby loved calling and especially teaching.  He called and taught for Danebo Circle 8 for many years.  Kirby enjoyed going to Penticton, BC each August to call and meet old friends and  make new ones.  Kirby started square dancing and round dancing back in the 60's when you memorized the round dances.   The caller would teach the round, and the dancers would buy the record with cue sheet at Light's Music in Springfield.  The caller would put on the record and remind the dancers how it started and away they went.   A memorial for Kirby  was held at the hall June 9.  Thoughts and prayers for Kirby's widow, Christina Corelli and families.

A huge Thank You from Christina to all of you who had Kirby on prayer lists and chains, sent e-mails, cards, came over, called, prayers, etc.  It all makes a difference, and you all have made one!  And thank you for checking up on me making sure I am okay.  We are family!

Keep on dancing, calling and cueing for FUN
Christina Corelli
Secretary  - CCCA
