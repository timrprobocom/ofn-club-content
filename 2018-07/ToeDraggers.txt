 It has been a great 1st half of 2018 and looking forward to a Star Spangled last half, with many fun dances with friends!
 May 26 was our mystery trip, hosted by our Big Toes Dan and Perrin.  We caravanned to Champoeg State Park Visitor Center where we watched a short film on the creation of Government in Oregon.  We then strolled thru the garden to a very old beautiful barn where K. C. called a couple of tips for us.  Then traveled to Oregon City and met clubs from Sunset Promenaders and Valley Squares for a couple tips in the parking lot of City Hall.  We then walked over to The Municipal Elevator and took a ride to view the city from above, very interesting.  We continued on to our final destination where we had a pizza and salad dinner and danced to the calling of Dan Nordbye with Julie Stiers cueing at Oak Grove Community Center.  A fun evening for all.
 The June 1st 50's 60's sock hop dance was very fun with James Dean (Aka K.C. Curtis calling) and Betty Boop (Aka Bev Flint cueing).  There was even an Elvis sighting or two, (cardboard of course).
 Please come join us to celebrate the birthday of our very own Yankee Doodle Dandy (K.C. Curtis) with an Old Fashion Picnic Dance on July 6th.  We will be serving hot dogs with all the fixin's and side dishes that go with it before the dance at 6:00.
 July 20th is our regular dance for the month.  Please come see us, it's always a treat to dance with all of you.
