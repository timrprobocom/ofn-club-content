Tri Squares began May with new officers:  President Deb Mandeville, Vice President Dale Brabham, Secretary Gloria Davis, Treasurer Bob Davis, Dance Coordinator Lynnea Loveberg, TVC Rep #1 Alice Hendricks, and TVC Rep #2 Judy Groom (who is a brand new member of our club!)
 In June we planned a Mystery Trip, which as I write this hasn’t happened yet, so it’s still a mystery to me!
 And in July we will be dark due to the heat, but we’ve scheduled visitations to some wonderfully air-conditioned clubs, Valley Squares on the 7th, and Bachelor ‘N Bachelorettes on the 18th.  See you there!
