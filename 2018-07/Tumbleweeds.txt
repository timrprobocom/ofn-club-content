Come and dance with the Tumbleweeds every Friday all summer in a well air conditioned dance hall. Plenty of free parking. We will be dark for the week of 4th of July. We look forward to dancing with Dan Nordby's calling July 13 and Les Seeley calling at our 46th Anniversary dance July 27. Help us welcome them and to celebrate with us at our anniversary dance! Our member, Dell Uptegrove, celebrated his 101st birthday in June.
