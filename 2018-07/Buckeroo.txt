May and the first part of June was filled with prep for our annual Buckeroo Round Up. We had Scot Byers and his lovely wife Erin call and cue for us. They have joined us for the Round Up several times over the past years. We spent three full days dancing and enjoying the company of dancers from around the area. Planning has already begun for the 2019 Round up! Mark your calendar now and plan to join us as we welcome Hunter Keller to the barn!
We hope to see many people join us at the Douglas County Fair in August as we dance the nights away under the stars!

Happy dancing,
Robin P. Faltersack
