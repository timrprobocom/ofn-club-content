We had a great time with our GOLD DIGGER Dance with Dean calling and Elaine cueing the rounds.  I want to thank all the dancers who made the trip to our dance.  I would also like to say a BIG THANK YOU to all the people who helped in the setting up and take down and the clean- up.  Another BIG THANK YOU to all the sponsors of the GOLD DIGGERS. 

We are going to be dark for the summer and will start back up in September with classes beginning on Monday, September 10th.  

We will be having our birthday dance on the Saturday, 9-15-18. We will be celebrating 64 years.
