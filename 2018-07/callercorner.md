Education is important.  It’s important for the dancer and important for the caller.  The more I educate myself, the more I grow.  In the northwest we are very blessed with many opportunities to grow.  I am creating an ongoing list of opportunities for those interested in calling.  These resources are wonderful for the person who hasn’t picked up a microphone yet to the experienced caller.

__There are ways to reduce the cost of training:__
 * Oregon has a fund for scholarships.  For more information on applying for a scholarship, email the Federation's Past President, currently Marilyn Schmit.
 * Callerlab <http://www.callerlab.org/> is a great resource for callers and dancers.  From definitions to lists of accredited caller coaches.  They offer scholarships and more information can be found at  <http://www.callerlab.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=BlQEXKBbCS8%3d>
 * Every year a FREE caller school is put on a few days preceding the National Convention.  I have wonderful things about this school and plan on going myself at the next National Convention I attend.  Contact Tony Oxendine with Grand Squares [Tony@TonyOxendine.com](mailto:tony@tonyoxendine.com) to get registered.
