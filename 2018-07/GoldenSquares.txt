Hello Dancers, Summer has arrived and it is so nice to have the long light days and warmer weather. We hope you all are enjoying it.
 
Golden Squares would like to invite you to dance with us this summer.  We have an air conditioned hall and a great dance floor.  We start our dances at 7 with pre-rounds, followed by mainstream with every third tip Plus or we just dance floor level. Randy Dibble is our caller and we have quest cuers. We dance at the Woodburn Estates & Golf community â€“ 1776 Country Club Rd Woodburn, OR 97071. The 5th Monday in July will be Pie Night so please come join us for some exercise followed by pie! 

We hope everyone has a wonderful holiday and hope to see you at a dance. Happy 4th of July, Teija
