The end of an era has occurred with the last night of instruction with Cheryl Manley and her husband, Geof. They are moving to Idaho and we will start a new era with Stephanie Lozano as our new cuer. Her assistant will be Leonard Snodgrass. He is learning to cue so it will be a summer of him learning the timing and the cues.

Cheryl’s last night at the club involved requests, photographs, an ice cream party and a parting gift of a Myrtlewood cutting board with a brass plate with the club name and date on it. We did a two hour session and just had fun. We wish them the best in their new adventures and Geof’s retirement. 

June 7 is our first night with Stephanie and we will have two hours of Phase 2 floor time and easy Phase 3. We are hoping that lots of new faces show up and have a good time getting better at their moves and more comfortable on the dance floor. On the second and fourth Thursdays, Ken Pratt will continue on with the Phase 3-4 and 4+ nights of dancing and working on Slow Two Step for the summer. The hours for these sessions are 6:30-9:30.

We will celebrate our 42nd birthday on June 14, so we are hoping for a good attendance. The dance will have occurred by the time this goes to print. Happy Summer to one and all. Marilyn Schmit
