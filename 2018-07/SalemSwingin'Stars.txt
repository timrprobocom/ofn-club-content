Salem Swingin' Stars dance all summer long.  We have an air conditioned hall so come on in and join us.

We held our Graduation for new Mainstream dancers on June 13.  Welcome to All.

Our first dance in June was a great one with six squares on the floor. Jay Henderson and Randy Dibble handled the calling duties. Thanks to all of the guests who came out. 
There are five Fridays in June so that means a 5th Friday Plus Dance on June 29.

We have been invited to dance at the World Beat Festival at the Salem Riverfront Park on Saturday June 30 from 4:30 - 5:30 pm. If you would like to join us, email Sheila at Sheilainsalem@hotmail.com to get put on the list. Leonard Snodgrass will call for us and we will be inviting the audience to join in. Square Dance attire is highly recommended.

There is also a Demo Dance at Lancaster Village Retirement Center on July 4 at 11:00 am.  Contact Harriet Livingston for more details. See you all on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
