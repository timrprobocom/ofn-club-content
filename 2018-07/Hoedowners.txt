You know that saying “Life’s a circus, enjoy the show”.  On May 12th the Hoedowners decided to take that advice during their Circus Dance.  Debbie Olson always does such a wonderful job decorating for this dance.  There were clowns everywhere including on the dance floor.  Red noses were provided for those who hadn’t come in costume.  There is nothing like the smell of fresh popcorn popping to make one feel like a kid again.
 The May 17-20th was our annual beach trip.  It luckily coincided with the Hayshakers Anniversary Dance so 17 of us were able to attend.  We took home some prizes too!  The beach trip was four days of fun activities, great food, games, visiting and laughter.  What were the highlights? Let me see; photos as Inverted Seaside, “Who am I?” game, miniature golf, kite flying, the scavenger hunt, jigsaw puzzles, a wine tasting, beach combing for sand dollars, clamming, driftwood sculpture building, “Sing that Tune” and other silly games that tickled your memory and your funny bone.
 On May 26th we held our Red, White and Blue Dance to honor those who gave their lives to protect our freedom and our veterans as well.
 July looms and here’s what we’ll be doing; the 14th will be our Luau Dance.  Can’t you smell the pikake already?  And on the 28th of July we’ll hold our Root Beer Float Dance.  Dances to help you enjoy the summer in the air conditioned Aloha Grange.
