WOW!! Fall is here! We have had a blast dancing the summer nights away but are looking forward to the much cooler and crisper weather that Fall brings to us.

Congratulations to our new Plus Dancers who graduated on September 5. Thirteen dancers received their Masters in Dancing Certificates and three of them are preteen dancers.

Our Annual Corn & Cluck Dance is September 21.  We hope that you did not miss it.  That Crazy Chicken always has something up his sleeve.

We have started another Beginning Square Dance Class on Wednesdays at 6:30 pm. Thanks to all of the "Angels" who are helping assist with this class.  Randy Dibble is also offering a Plus workshop from 8:00 pm - 9:30 pm following the Beginners class.  Come on by if you would like to brush up on your Plus skills. The cost is $6.00 per dancer.

The Mid Willamette Area Fall Festival is September 29 at 7:30 pm at the Salem Square Dance Center.  We are the hosts for the evening and Randy is the Caller MC.

We will have two dances in October, on Oct. 5 and Oct. 19. In November, we will dance three times, the 2nd, the 16th and the 30th. The 30th will be our 5th Friday Plus dance. 
See you all on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
