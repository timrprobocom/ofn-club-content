Hope everyone had a great summer and you all are ready to get back to full time dancing.

Wolf Pack didn't dance on Sept 1 as it was Labor Day weekend and lots of people were busy.  We started our lessons on the 11th of Sept with 3 clubs from Emerald Empire combining all of their lessons so we usually have a very good class.

Oct. 6 Wolf Pack/Boots & Sandals will be having a Spaghetti Dinner Dance.  Dinner is at 6:30, plus at 7:30 and mainstream at 8:00.  Dinner and dance is $10.00 per person. Dance only is $5 per adult/$2 per youth. My mouth is watering already.

Oct 27 Boots & Sandals/Wolf Pack will be having a Halloween dance, Spooky!

Don't miss out on all the fun and join us 1st & 4th Saturdays at the Emerald Square Dance Center in Springfield.
