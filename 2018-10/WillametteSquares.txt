Willamette Squares met for their regular dance on the fourth Saturday in August, their watermelon dance, and as usual, those in attendance had a great time dancing in the Square Dance Centerâ€™s air conditioned hall.
We are foregoing our annual fall square and round dance lessons in favor of supporting Sunday evening lessons at the Salem Hospital beginning Sept 16th, hosted by the Independence Wagon Wheelers.  Any and all clubs are encouraged to take part either as students or angels.
Please note the meeting on Sept 22 of the Oregon Federation of Round and Square dance clubs for which Willamette Squares is the host. Meet that evening at the Salem Square Dance Center, 3695 45th Avenue, Salem OR. Submitted for Jodee Howard by Steve Hoots
