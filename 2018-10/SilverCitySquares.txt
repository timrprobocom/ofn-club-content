Thank you to all who joined us for our September dance. We enjoyed dancing to Leonard and Frances and having the selection of pies for break.

Our October dance is a regular dance with a Halloween theme in decorations - costumes are welcomed. Look ahead for our November dance - this is our ham dinner dance and we will be serving a ham dinner before the dance. Watch for the flyers for prices.

This report was turned in before Mom (Karyn Buchheit) went to the teen festival meeting. I will report next month on the location for next year's teen festival. Mom will have reported by then to the OFSRDC, Mid-Willamette Area Council and Mid-Winter Festival Committee and Summer Festival 2019 Committee. See you at a dance soon.
