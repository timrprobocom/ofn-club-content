Tami Helms cued a dance for us while Jeanine was away this summer.  It's amazing to think that Tami's first guest cueing gig with us was in 1989!  Randy Lewis also cued a dance for us in Jeanine's absence.  It was noted that he cued the first M&M dance that was held at the Winona Grange in 1985.  We are so happy to have relocated from our original dance location, Multnomah CC and have made Winona Grange our home. 
 Our birthday dance, October 20th, will have 7:00 p.m. plus, 7:30 prerounds, and mainstream from 8:00-10:00, at which time the dance will end, and we will go downstairs for Birthday Cake.
