Cherry City Cloggers have been quite busy this summer. We just wrapped up our demo season with our final demo being at the Oregon State Fair. We also performed at Silverton Art Fair, The Bush Barn Art Fair, and the Marion County Fair and at World Beat.  

We have several people who are interested in taking lessons which will begin September 18 at the Salem Square Dance Center. Anyone interested can check out our website cherrycitycloggers.com for more information.

It is also that time of year again when we will be electing officers for this upcoming year.  We look forward to our new season. Georganne
