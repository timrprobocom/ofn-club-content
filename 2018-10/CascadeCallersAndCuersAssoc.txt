Our next scheduled dance is September 29 at the hall in Springfield with pre-rounds at 7:30 and plus from 8 to 10PM.  Our callers and cuers will be doing the dance for you.  Please come and join us for an evening of FUN!  The callers and cuers have a meeting at 6:30 before the dance. 

Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli will be calling and cueing a New Year's Eve dance.  More details will be available next month.  Any callers or cuers present New Year Eve will be asked if they'd like to call and;/or cue.  Sounds like a fun way to bring in 2019!

Keep on dancing, calling and cueing for FUN
