The Hayshakers had a meeting in September to determine how the club should proceed.  Because of low attendance it was decided to have one dance a month instead of two.  This dance will be on the 3rd Saturday of the month at 7:30.  We will continue with the Seaside Sashay.
 Speaking of the Sashay, it is on October 26th and 27th.  Hope to see you there.  Call if there are any questions, Sylvia 503-325-8109 or Joyce Clark 503-647-5742.
