To say the month of August was a warm one was an understatement!  Luckily the Hoedowners were completely prepared with several summer activities.
 We had so much fun on August 5th at our annual Hoedowner Hop’s Night!  The weather was warm, and as the sun was setting an amazing group of people were looking forward to the coolness of the evening.  Who could ask for more?  Well, perhaps the Hops could have won but 11 runs were knocked in, unfortunately the majority were for Vancouver.  It was one of those get togethers where you just have time to visit, catch up, laugh a lot and relax together.
 On the 11th of August we had our “Here’s the Scoop Dance” with "Elvis' in the hall.  Mark Wheeler was our guest caller, with Randy Lewis cueing.  The next day the Hoedowners co-hosted the Hahn Barn dance.
 We were prepared for the hot weather on the 25th for our “Hot August Nights” with refreshing cool fruit and melons.
 Please join us on the 13th of October for our only dance of the month.  We will be having our first “Pirates Booty” dance.  ARRGH!  Daryl Clendenin will be calling and Randy Lewis cueing.  Yvonne Clendenin has retired as the Hoedowner’s cuer because of health.
 We’re going dark on October 27th for the Seaside Sashay.  Hope we see across the Square at the Seaside Convention Center!
