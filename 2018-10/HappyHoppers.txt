Anyone who has moved to a new home knows that the transition into new surroundings can be both exciting and challenging at the same time.  Things that were a normal pattern in the previous home may need to be changed.  Questions of “Where do we put this?” or “How do we use this space?” are all part of the adjustment time.  Usually, however, things work out, and the new surroundings do indeed become home.

The Happy Hoppers are in the adjustment period in our new home, the Washington Grange, located at 7701 NE Ward Road, Vancouver, WA.  Unfortunately, our first dance in September needed to be canceled due to a previous rental by the Grange to another party.  Undaunted, the Hoppers planned a visitation to the River City Dancers to replace the lost dance night.  Therefore, our first real Hopper dance of the season will be October 6th.  In the meantime, we are getting used to our new home during our plus and mainstream lessons which take place at 6:30 on Monday nights.  By the time we get to our first dance we hope to be comfortably settled into our new home.  
We are also pleased to be going back to our old schedule of dances starting at 7:30 with pre-rounds and then a plus dance at 8:00.  We found that the 7:00 time seemed to be too early for many of our dancers.  Hopefully, the 7:30 time will make it easier for people who have family or busy Saturday schedules.

We hope you mark your calendars and plan to join us at our new location for our first dance of the coming season.
