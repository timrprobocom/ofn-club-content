This time of year is strange for the Columbia River Dancers.  In September we had only one dance due to the clogger's convention renting the Grange.  In October, we have chosen to go dark and support the Seaside Sashay.  We will have one dance on October 13th and it should be a dandy.  Mark wheeler will be calling and Julie Stiers will be cueing.  Someone said that Elvis might even show up.
 We have had a very strange summer with many dances and lessons canceled because of the heat.  The officers have discussed the possibility of going dark in July and August of next year, but so far it is only talk.  It is hard to decide as many want to dance in the summer, but without air conditioning the Grange does get hot.  That is for next year, not now.  Come dance with us.  We make sure all get to dance, so single are more than welcome.
 Lastly, beginning lessons start the first Tuesday of each month from 7-8:30 and mainstream from 8:30-9.  Jim Hattrick is our teacher and a fine job he does.
 Remember to dance to the beat of the music and smile.  It is more fun that way!
