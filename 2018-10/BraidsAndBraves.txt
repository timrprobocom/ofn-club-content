Our Community Dance was well-attended. We hope to have some folks attend classes and some to refresh their skills. It was a different format and quite an interesting afternoon. I see another club is also trying such an event. Our lessons began Sept. 9

We look forward to cooler, cleaner air and more clubs to dance with this Fall. See you in a Square. Carmen
