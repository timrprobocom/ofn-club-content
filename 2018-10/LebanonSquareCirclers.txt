In September, Lebanon Square Circlers gathered at Frank and Marianne Cawrseâ€™s for their annual Labor Day Campout. Highlights of the campout included the Silo Dance, where club caller Charlotte Jeskey calls from atop a 100 foot grain silo. Cards, games and hayrides rounded out a very fun and relaxing weekend. 
Our first dance of this season was on September 15.  We are also doing a demon-stration dance at a local nursing home and one at the Farmers Market to publicize our lessons starting on the 16th of September. Our annual Black Light Dance is on the 3rd Saturday of October.  Hope to see lots of dancers there. Marilyn York
