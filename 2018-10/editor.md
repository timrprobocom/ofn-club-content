Some people have suggested that it is time for another change in the OFN.

To be specific, many believe that no one reads the articles, the columns, or the club news items.  They say most people are getting their club news from Facebook now, where things are posted immediately, instead of being seen weeks after they are written.

What do you think?  Should we get rid of articles and news items, and have the OFN contain just flyers and Where & When info?  Do you read the articles?  Do you click on the advertisements?  I'd love to get your feedback at [timr@probo.com](mailto:timr@probo.com).
