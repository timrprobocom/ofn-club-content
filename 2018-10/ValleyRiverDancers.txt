Mainstream lessons, taught by our caller Randy Dibble, were scheduled to start Sept 11th and continue Tuesdays 6:30-8 p.m.  First two lessons free and $6 thereafter.
 Advanced lessons, also taught by Randy Dibble were to begin immediately following MS lessons Tuesdays 8-9:30 p.m., $6.If there are no new students, this will become an “A” workshop.  
 In August we pulled out our flowered shirts and skirts and put flowers in our hair for our annual Hawaiian Luau Dance.  We had three squares and danced to upbeat party swizzle music that makes you want to get up and dance!
 If you’ve been to our 2nd Friday Plus Dance lately you may have noticed we have a slightly new format as we are incorporating an ‘A’ Tip instead of just pre-rounds in the first 30 minutes.  Also if there are enough ‘A’ dancers still around after 10, there could be another ‘A’ Tip at the end.
 In September don’t forget our rockin’ to the 50’s Mainstream Dance (Friday, September 28th).  Put your hair in a ponytail and come show off your poodle skirt!  We square up at 7:30 for Plus with MS and Rounds from 8-10:30 p.m.
 Please note the 5th Saturday (September 29th) Advanced Dance held in Woodburn is cancelled this month.(There isn’t another 5th Saturday until December, and as of right now there is no news to report about this dance.)
 Our October Mainstream Dance is a regular dance, October 26th called by Randy Dibble and cued by Julie Stiers.  Come out to Newberg for a fun evening of dancing.
 Looking ahead, in November we will have our Gospel Dance (Friday, November 23rd), so save the date for this annual favorite.  Dan Nordbye will be the caller and Julie Stiers will be cueing.
