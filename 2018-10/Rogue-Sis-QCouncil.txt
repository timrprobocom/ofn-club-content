Hi Everyone,

Don't forget about the "Game Basket" to benefit the next "Young at Heart" Dance. This dance will be next July. Exact date and place is yet to be determined. 
If you have any games or puzzles to donate to this basket, let Lorri or Lois know.  All proceeds will go to the "Young at Heart" or Youth Dance.  
Lorri will have this basket at the dances she attends, so you can purchase raffle tickets.

The next "Fifth Friday" Council Dance will be November 30th, 2018 in Medford with Lawrence Johnstone calling and Rikki Lobato cueing.  There will be Advanced from 630 to 730, then pre-rounds and Mainstream with Plus until 1030. Come on out and enjoy the fun. Lawrence always calls a fun dance.

There is now an "in progess" website for the council - you can check it out at: https://sites.google.com/view/roguesis-qcouncil/home

PLEASE support the Council and the Clubs in the Rogue Valley.  Everyone needs all the support they can get.  Times are "skinny," so, please come out and help by supporting your local clubs.  We don't want to lose any clubs because of non-support from the dancers.

Don't forget, we have changed our meeting location. We are now at Round Table Pizza in Poplar Square. Our next meeting will be October 2, 2018 at 430pm.  

Lois & Lorri
