We held two dances in August, both of them casual and well attended for summer dances.  Aug. 10 Jim Hattrick called with his good friend and caller Mark Wheeler helping out.  The Ice Cream Social was a big hit as always—we had an impromptu one in July too as we know how much everyone loves ice cream, especially our Treasurer Joy Pitts.  Jim Hattrick and Jackie Gale did their very best for the small but enthusiastic crowd.

Aug. 24 saw Terry Halley calling with Jackie Gale cueing.  We always enjoy having Terry down to call for us at the end of summer—it’s becoming an annual event as he will be calling next year too at the end of August.  Betty was there with him and helped fill out some of the squares here and there.  That night our Treasurer brought the left- overs from our club  picnic so we had hamburgers and hotdogs as well as our regular finger foods.  I think I see a pattern here.  Single Trees love to eat as well as dance!

Please come join us for the new dance year.  Jim Hattrick always calls our 2nd Friday dances, in September Craig Abercrombie and Al Frazier called our 4th Friday dance and in October George Hermann will be calling our Halloween dance Oct. 26.
