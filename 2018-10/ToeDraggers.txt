Welcome to fall ya all!  The Toes had a few of our members follow KC and Linda down to Port Orford in late August for the Beach Combers Battlerock festival.  Lots of fun and pie making was had by the men, with Big Toe, Tim Roberts winning 2nd place and the coveted "peoples choice award"!  Way to go Toes!  I guess Kathy Roberts isn't the only award winning baker in that family; evidently Tim was paying attention!
 Our lessons have started, they are taking place at the Kinton Grange on Wed, evenings at 7:00 pm. Please send all interested persons our way.
 October 5th is our regular dance for the month, but then don't go too far away, because Sunday October 7th is the "Man enough to wear Pink" dance.  The fun starts at 2:00, and there will be many wonderful baskets to be raffled off.
 DIFFERENT LOCATION:  Our October 17th dance will be at the IOOF hall in Hillsboro.  This will be a costume dance with the theme A Viking Dance.  This should be a very fun and interesting dance, don't miss it.
 October 28th is our Jamboree and if you bring all your students it is sure to be a Howling Halloween themed party!  This is also a canned food drive.  Please see our flyer in the OFN for times of this event.
 Come have some fun with the Toes!
