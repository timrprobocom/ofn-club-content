Valley Squares T-Shirt dance on August 4th was really fun and the air conditioning kept us cool enough to dance.  The August 18th dance, "Summer fun", with Dan Nordbye was well attended with a visitation from Buzzin' Bee's.  They received a VS banner.  It's always great to dance with other clubs.  
 Anniversary dances have started for the new year and we plan on attending as many as possible.  We are making plans for our 70th on April 6, 2019.  Speaking of anniversary dances, we will be DARK on October 6th to be able to attend Sunset Promenaders Anniversary dance.  
 Our October 20th dance, "Monster Mash" with Janienne Alexander calling, will be a lot of fun.  Dress like a monster if you like or anything else, but costumes are not required.  We will have fun and dance, dance, dance no matter what we wear (just don't come naked).
