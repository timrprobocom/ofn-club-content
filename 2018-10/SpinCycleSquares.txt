We continue to dance Sunday nights from 5:30 - 8:00 at all levels with our competent caller and teacher, Tim Matteson.  We encourage dancers to come dance with us and get more floor time.  Please call our president, David Lajoie at 541-520-7311 or Tim at 541-988-0399 to make sure we are dancing as we go dark once in a blue moon.  We don't want to miss you.  Our dances/classes are always casual.  We always have a lot of food too.  Come for a fun evening almost every Sunday!

Kris Jensen, national caller from Albuquerque, called for us September 9.  What a treat!

We are so blessed that we get to dance to her fine calling a number of times during the year. Kris and Kurt's mom lives in Eugene now. 

Remember that our hall is air conditioned and has a cushioned wood floor. 

Happy Dancing,
Christina Corelli
