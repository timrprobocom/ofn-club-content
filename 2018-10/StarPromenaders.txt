	Well, the Circle and Squares had their Birthday Dance this past weekend. A grand time was had by the three plus squares in attendance. Dean did a superb job...even threw some “A” at us to keep us on our toes.  Rikki Lobato kept the floor covered with multi levels of cuing.  We had a couple camped in our yard and they came down with us for our official visitation. Kevin and Cyd Hunter are from Terre Haute, Indiana and are traveling around the country in their motor home with their Harley and dancing up a storm. They enjoyed the handful of “A” that was tossed at us.   GOOD DANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!

	Our New Dancer Classes started Thursday and we had three squares on the floor.  Big thanks to all the Angels that showed up to help.  I hope we keep up this good work.  Bring a dancer or a friend or a stranger from the super market and come join our fun...............

	At this point there is no Plus Class scheduled... keep you ears open we are working on it...

	Wayne Weaver will be starting his “A” Workshop and then classes on Wednesdays.  Watch for his e:mails as he will only be calling when is not out of town.  He is after all RETIRED.  Just ask Debbi...

	I sure would like to see more club members and new dancers at our meetings.  We have a few committees that need leaders and it is so nice to get to visit.

	Our Mainstrean Birthaversaries dance on the 13th will be called by Wayne Weaver (or MC'D) As that will be our caller/cuer let me try it dance!!!     So if you can, or sorta can, call or cue come to our stage and show off.  It should be an evening of excitement and surprises.

	Mexican Train/Cribbage Night will be on the Friday 19th....old fashioned picnic is the theme for the potluck.  Bring your dominoes/cards and food and a friend or two and join us for fun food and prizes........
