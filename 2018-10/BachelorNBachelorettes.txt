Now that our newly remodeled bathrooms are complete, the next project may be to take out the giant tree in our north parking lot.  Grange arborist Prudy Pruner is assessing whether the grange should take out the tree now, or wait for the next ice storm to snap it apart.  Our parking valet (Parker Parkit) has offered to run our presidentâ€™s truck into the tree which also might do the trick.  Stay tuned!
