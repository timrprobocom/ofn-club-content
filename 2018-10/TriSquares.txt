In August Tri Squares were dark but we kept busy by visiting the Sunset Promenaders and the Hoedowners.  We really enjoyed dancing with them in their air conditioning.
 In October we plan to visit the Sunset Promenaders for their 33rd anniversary and have our “Apple Fest Dance” on the 13th and “Blast From the Past Dance” on the 26th.  All our members are looking forward to the “Seaside Sashay” on the 27th.
