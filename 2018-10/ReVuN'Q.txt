As I sit here, there is a gentle breeze outside and the city workers are tearing up the street around the corner. There are lots of noises from the trucks and backhoes.
The club is at the end of the summer season and we had our End of Summer dance on September 6. We started the new season of lessons Sept. 13 with Intro to Cha for those Phase 2 dancers who were ready to move up into easy Phase 3. Then there was a 30- minute workshop to have some floor time for Phase 2 and easy 3. Following that was some West Coast Swing lessons and then the 4+ and Easy 5 dancers closed out the evening. Our new schedule will continue on until about Mid-Winter and we will evaluate where we are with Cha and West Coast Swing. There is always room on our dance floor for visitors.
Our club has adjusted their lessons to include Phase 2 dancers who have no place to learn Phase 3. Normally before, we were only Phase 3 & 4. With the adjustment, we have some new faces joining us and hope to have more as we start the new season.
Our club is scheduled to help out with the Federation meeting on September 22-23. Not sure what we are doing yet, but Iâ€™m sure we will find out soon enough. Marilyn Schmit
