The Wave Steppers’ last dance of the 2018 season is our “Fall Dance” on Saturday, October 13th.  The Fall Dance will have caller Joe Wrabek and line dancing with Gwen Kiel.  After that, the club will be dark for the winter, except for classes and the annual Christmas party.
 The Wave Steppers’ dances are held at Garibaldi City Hall, 107 Sixth Street (just a block off US 101, 9 miles north of Tillamook).  About two-thirds of the second floor of City Hall is a dance floor, built in the 1940s for the old Firemen’s Balls.
 The club’s free square dance classes taught by club caller Joe Wrabek continue on Wednesdays, 5:30 to 7 p.m. at the Tillamook Elks Lodge, 1907 Third St. in downtown Tillamook.
