Since we are having dances only in January & July for now, we have been visiting the other clubs in the area.  The Rogue Squares are going to continue to support the other clubs, especially the Star Promenaders, since they are in Medford too. We will see how the situation is after January and the annual "Pajamarama." Bring your September students out and have a blast.

We went to the Circle N Square's Birthday Dance on September 15th and had a ball.  Dean Black is a terrific caller. We will be visiting the Potato Festival in Klamath Falls in the middle of October and Harvest Hoedown in Yuba City the end of October.  The list goes on & on.

We are still working on the future for the Rogue Squares. Come on out and help us make a comeback. You won'b be sorry.

See you in a square!!!
