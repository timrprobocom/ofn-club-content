The Council encourages all dancers to attend the anniversary dances of member clubs.  The Sunset Promenaders start the month out on the 6th at the Hillsboro IOOF Hall with their 33rd anniversary dance featuring the calling of Mike Stout and Darrell Kalmbach with cueing by Ken Pratt and Julie Stout.  Next, on the 20th, the Mix â€˜N Mingle celebrate 34 with Randy Dibble and Jeanine Norden.  Please see their respective flyers below.
 Since the OFN is published mid month, you may still have time to plan on the two anniversary dances remaining in September: Toe Draggers will hold their Berry Good 43rd Anniversary Dance at the Kinton Grange on the 21st, KC Curtis calling and Bev Flint cueing; and the Tri Squares have their 20th Anniversary dance at the Tigard Grange on the 28th with national caller Adam Christman and Sandra Pinion cueing.  See the individual club reports and flyers below for additional information
 In addition, there is the Tri Council dance hosted by the Portland Area Council.  The dance will be held at the Oak Grove Community Center, 14496 SE Cedar Avenue 97267 on the fifth Saturday in September, the 29th from 7PM to 11PM.  Stephen Cole will be the featured caller with Ken Pratt cueing the rounds.
