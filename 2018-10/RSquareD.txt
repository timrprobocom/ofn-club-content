We are new members of the Chamber of Commerce and had our official ribbon cutting at the demo we gave at the Vintage Square in Longview.  Amidst artisan's booths and activities it was a visible place for the public to see what we do, and that square dancing is fun.  Boy, did we have fun!  The clouds opened up and poured buckets full of rain and we kept on dancing while Darrel Kalmbach kept calling till the end of the song.  Then, we headed for cover!  We hope that with the Chamber's regular posting of activities to the business community we will draw some interest and participation in our lessons this fall.  They will start on September 17th and finish on November 7th, twice a week â€“ on Monday and Wednesday evenings. 
We have danced our final summer dance and I saw 6 squares on the floor. We have had this kind of participation all summer.  This was especially nice as there was also a big pile of school supplies donated so we will be able to help 2 of our local schools this year.
 REMEMBER:  September began our regular dance schedule: 2nd Friday, 4th Saturday. Plus: 7pm - 8pm, Mainstream with rounds: 8 - 10pm; PLAN to come for our big Octoberfest weekend October 12-14 at Rose Valley Grange, Kelso.  See our flyer for the many activities we have arranged for your weekend.
