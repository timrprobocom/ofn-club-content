Fall is here and so are lots more dancing.  Hope everyone had a wonderful summer.
We start our new classes Sept 25 at the IOOF Hall (see flyer in Aug issue)
 
October 5 we have our annual TALK LIKE A PIRATE DANCE. It is one of our best attended dances of the year. The costumes are always very creative and fun and so is the dancing (fun and creative). Oct 19 we have a Pie dance with GIRLS NIGHT OUT CALLING AND CUEING. That should also be a lot of fun.
 
Bruce Lowther is our regular caller and Sandy Harris is our Cuer We dance the first and third Fridays with pre-rounds on the first Friday and Pre-Plus on the third Friday. We would love to have you join us for fun dancing and good company. Sandy
