As I write this, we're looking ahead to our mainstream lessons starting on September 27, and we're hoping for a good-sized class. This fall we are partnering with Linn-Benton Community College and the class will be held at the Benton Center in Corvallis with Bruce Lowther instructing. 
Our regular dance season started on Sept. 8 with an enthusiastic crowd coming early for a tailgate party and then the dance. We're grateful to be able to continue dancing on the second and fourth Saturdays at the hall at the Congregational church with its lovely wood floor. In October, we're having our yearly Halloween dance on October 27, and it will be a fun and festive time! Happy Autumn everyone! Karen
