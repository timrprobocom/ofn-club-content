It’s great to be dancing as a club again after being dark in August!   We are excited about the enthusiastic students in our Fall mainstream class, this year being held at Salem Hospital. The Salem Hospital location is terrific, and we greatly appreciate the opportunity to hold our classes there.  If you’re reading this report before September 30 it’s not too late to send or bring new dancers our way.  Lessons are on Sundays 6-8 pm in rooms D2-1 and D2-2, Salem Hospital Building D.  Use Visitor Parking [free]).   Registration ends September 30.  See the OFN for details.  Come dance with us on 1st and 2nd Saturdays at Polk County Fairgrounds in Rickreall.  And by all means don’t miss our upcoming special dances:   November 3 Halloween Dance; December 8 Christmas Dance; March 9 IWW Birthday Dance; April 13 Easter dance.  Hope to see you across a square!
