Well here it is, September. September marks the end of summer and the beginning of school. School means lessons. For us at River City Dancers it means TWO things. It means both round dance lessons and square dance lessons . Tami will be teaching round dance starting at 3PM on Sunday September 16 and Darrell will be starting square dance lessons at 5:PM the same day. The rest of us will be busy helping.

Les Seeley was our guest caller for our first dance in September and our club caller Darrell Kalmback called the rest of our dances.

We continue to have club visitations each month. We visited Tri Squares in September to help them celebrate their 25th anniversary and our October visitation will be to the Seaside Sashay on October 27 at Seaside. 

If you miss us at any of our club visitations, no fear.  Just come to Milwaukie Community Center in Milwaukie any second or third Saturday evening and dance with us. We warmly welcome both couples and singles . We love having guests.
