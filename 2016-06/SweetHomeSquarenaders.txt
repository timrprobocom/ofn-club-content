We have had lively and enjoyable dances this year thanks to our caller, Jim Voll, and our cuer, Jackie Gale. Jim tried something new this year with our new dancer classes. To help students feel more confident and consequently enjoy dancing more, he holds B-51 classes and introduces only a few new moves at a time.
Our first group, ages 9 to15, finished in January and enjoyed dancing at the Mid-Winter Festival. They proceeded to learn the rest of the Mainstream moves and now angel for the present batch of B-51 students which began in February. Our new group consists of five youngsters (ages 6 to 9) and three adults. What fun we have!&nbsp; To make classes even more exciting, we have a real dance at the class level on the fourth Sunday of every month, the same time as the regular class. Jackie even cues for these dances. We plan to have a B-51 dance in July and in August! Come and join in the fun!
