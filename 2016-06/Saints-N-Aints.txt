Our birthday dance in April went very well.  We had door prizes and a plant raffle.  Yours truly won one of the plants.  Cherie Cox baked and decorated a birthday cake for us.  Thank you, Cherie!

In May we had our Cinco de Mayo dance.  Thanks go out to all who helped decorate and provide all of the food!

June, July & August all of our dances will be casual dress. Our caller, Sherm, will be taking July & August off so we will have local callers for our dances.  Come and support these new callers if you are visiting the South Coast!
