The Milton-Freewater Muddy Frogs have completed the social ballroom lessons under the guidance of Neva Reid. This has been a very popular class.  The mainstream class under the able calling of Bill Reid will be graduating soon.  The Frogs are very involved in the 2018 Washington State Festival, with our president, Merri Anne Huber, at the helm.  This festival will be held at the Three Rivers Convention Center in Kennewick, WA, the same place our council held a very successful state festival in 2013.
We will still be dancing at the Milton-Freewater Community Building on the third Sunday of the month, from 3:00-5:00, with a potluck following.  Call Merri Anne at 541-861-9055 before you come.  Bill and Neva Reid are much appreciated as our club caller and cuer.
Dancing is healthy!
