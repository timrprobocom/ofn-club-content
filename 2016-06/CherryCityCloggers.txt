Wow, we have been soooo busy; we did a wonderful, fun demo at Ag Fest as we danced all day on their main stage. We have new dancers signed up for fall classes already. Yippee. Then there was the shopping for goodies, eating farm fresh food, and more dancing.

We have our Clogghoppers having a blast. They are learning new songs and are being treated to some lovely young ladies joining them for some fun dancing. 

Our January class has moved up to the next level and then a new class is coming along swiftly. They are great fast learners. We have many coming events and demos. Marion County Fair, Salem Art Fair and World Beat, plus lots of fun demos at care centers, private events and even have a great Mary & Cheri Workshop. It is going to be great fun with more fun coming. Double Toe Tap. Joanie.
