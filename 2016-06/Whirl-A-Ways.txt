The Whirl-A-Ways had a busy April with our spring business meeting on April 17th to elect new club officers for the 2016 &ndash; 2017 dance year. I don&rsquo;t know how other clubs are doing but it is getting more and more difficult to get volunteers to step forward.&nbsp; However, we did have nearly a fifty percent membership participation in the potluck/meeting.
For our 4th Saturday dance we had a large contingent of visitors from the Roseburg Buckeroos. They had more than enough to take home one of our banners. Time to start planning a return visit to retrieve it.
A few years ago the Single Trees and Whirl-A-Ways decided to come together for a Fiesta Dance during the 2nd weekend of the month. We alternate each year and this year we are looking forward to the Single Trees on May 13th. It promises to be fun with George Hermann and Mike Kious calling. Jackie Gale is cuing.
The Whirl-A-Ways are welcoming the Crew to the Emerald Square Dance Center on Sunday afternoon, June 5th. The dance will be from 2 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Yvonne Clendenin will be the cuer for the afternoon.
For several years now a large group of Whirl-A-Ways have made their way up the mountains for an early summer camp out. Location: Camp Sherman RV Park and Motel, June 17, 18, and 19. A great weekend of fellowship and great food.
Whirl-A-Ways will wrap its dance year on June 25th with our annual pie and ice cream social. So come one and come all to a great dance and plenty of food. Hope to see you all on the dance floor.
