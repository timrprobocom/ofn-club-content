It has been a busy time for the Lebanon Square Circlers. In April, we had our Hippie Dance on the 2nd with lots of fun costumes and then a regular dance on the 16th. Charlotte Jeskey called for these dances and Jackie Gale cued. 

On the 30th of April, our club went on its Mystery Trip. Frank Cawrse had arranged with the Braids and Braves for a special dance held at the Yamhill Heritage Center in McMinnville. We left Lebanon about 5:00 PM, and picked up dancers in Albany and Salem. On the trip, we had fun games led by Barb Schaefer, and also singing. Leonard Snodgrass was the caller for the dance and Sandra Pinion the cuer. It was a fun Time! We had a "mock wedding" on the way home on the bus -- Nick Heineck officiated. So you can tell that our Mystery Trip was a "blast". 

We are now getting ready for our Strawberry Festival Weekend. We are collecting items for the Silent Auction and getting clothing ready for the Experienced Clothing Sale. There will be dances on both Friday night and Saturday. The big Lebanon Strawberry Festival parade will be on Saturday morning-- and our club float will be in it. Randy Dibble will be our caller on Saturday evening and Jackie Gale our cuer. Of course, we are serving strawberry shortcake on Saturday night. Then the weekend closes with a breakfast on Sunday. Hope to see you in a square! 

Our club goes dark for the summer but we are planning some special activities.
