Greetings from the Buzzin Bees. We held our elections in April and our new officers are as follows: President - Elmer Toops, Vice president - Betty Toops, Secretary - Carol Zellmer and treasurer - Bruce Prenguber. Many thanks to our outgoing president Dennis and Julie Woods and our outgoing secretary Holly Grissom. Thank you for jobs well done.

We are coming up on our last dance for the season on June 4th, 2016. We plan a potluck barbecue prior to the dance. ( I am not sure of the time yet. You can call Dennis Woods @ 360- 253-3820 for the time) Plus lesson at 6pm. Prerounds at 7:30 and Mainstream at 8.) Attire is casual. We will be dark on 6 / 18 / 16 and all summer. Our first dance for the new season will be 9/17/16.

This Summer the bees will be joining Mike and Debbie Combs who are campground hosts at Silver Springs campgrounds for a camp out in August. Looking forward to Fantastic food with our experienced Dutch oven chef, Dennis Woods. We hope you have a great summer.
