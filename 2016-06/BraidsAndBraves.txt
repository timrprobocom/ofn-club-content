We had a busy month! We did a demo at the Yamhill Valley Heritage Center's Farm Fest and Plowing Competition. What a fascinating place!

Then the following Saturday was our Club Dance with a Gospel Music theme, one of my personal favorites. Such great fun singing along while Leonard called or Sandra cued!

Finally, we hosted a Mystery Dance for the Lebanon Square Circlers and other MWA friends on the fifth Saturday. We had at least 6 squares of dancers, loads of great food and a good old 'Barn Dance' atmosphere. There was a covered wagon in a corner of the room, quilts on the wall and hay bales covered with feed sacks to sit on. The Heritage Center&rsquo;s collection of antique vehicles also drew our guests' attention. Even some of our club dressed in pioneer gowns! What a fun, busy month!
