Bring on summer! Our first dance on June 4th is the Picnic Dance. Dress in your picnic best and enjoy hot dogs (provided by the club) with all the fixins at break.
 Special events coming up in July: our annual Yard Sale on the second weekend to raise funds to support Club activities, and later in the month, the familyâ€&ldquo;friendly, fun-in-the-park, annual Saturday picnic in Oregon City. More details later.

 We dance throughout the summer with air-conditioning and a comfy hardwood floor.  We dance on the first and third Saturdays beginning at 7:00pm with round dancing activities, picking up the square dancing at 8:00pm. Join us!
