May brought the installation of our new officers. We are grateful to Doug and Kathie Femrite for capably serving as our outgoing president and to Donna Krossman-Darling as our second vice president. We welcome Marc and Bev De La Bruere as our incoming president and Robert and Young Lumsden as our new second vice president. Also, a large thanks to Tom and Katie Cassatt who remain first vice president and Dan and Debbie Ragland who continue to serve as treasurer. Ron Rasmussen will continue to help us with publicity and yield the secretary job to Charlie and Linda Phillips. Thanks to everyone willing to serve in these volunteer positions.

May also marks the graduation of our mainstream class. Scott Zinser has successfully coached them along, and they are doing well. We hope to see many of them at our dances in June. We will be having plus workshops through the summer on every Thursday evening with Scott Zinser from 7:30-9:30 PM, $5 per person, starting June 2, 2016.

Our April 30th dance marked the return of an all plus menu to our 5th Saturday dances and was well attended. Scott Zinser and Frances Herigstad were the caller and cuer and did a great job. We thank everyone who came out to visit the Barn and to make it a fun evening. The decision was made in March to return to having our 5th Saturday dances be all plus level after several years of mainstream, and so far that seems to be a winner. Another decision was made to shift our dance nights to 1st, 4th, and 5th Saturdays starting in 2016. There are fewer clubs dancing on 4th Saturdays than there are 3rd Saturdays. We look forward to making whatever changes will promote square dancing participation.
