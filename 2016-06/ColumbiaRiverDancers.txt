As the old song says, "June is bust’in out all over…" and unlike many clubs, the Columbia River Dancers are going to be dancing through the summer.  This is a good time for all of the area dancers to keep their skills sharp.  While square dance attire is always in style, our summer dances are much more informal as the Hazel Dell Grange does not have air conditioning.  Flip-flops are not encouraged, however.
 We will be having a GREAT BALLS OF FUR dance on May 28 to help our furry friends at Second Chance Companions.  We are encouraging everyone to bring cat and/or dog food to the dance.  Our caller that evening will be our own Jim Hattrick.  
 We are still lining up our caller for our June 11 dance and have Jim back on the 28th.  
 Just as a reminder, we dance plus from 7 to 8 PM and mainstream from 8 to 10:00.  See you in a square.
  Nick Johnson and Nancy Smith
