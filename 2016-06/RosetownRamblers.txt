Seven Ramblers attended the Portland Area Council’s Fifth Friday Dance on April 29. What a wonderful evening of dancing and friendship, as well as a great opportunity to interact with dancers from other area clubs. The Ramblers extend their thanks and appreciation to all the hard-working volunteers who organized and presented the dance. We look forward to the next one!
 
We celebrated Mainstream graduation at our May 7 dance. Ian Craig did a fantastic job of keeping us on our toes and making sure we had lots practice using our left hands! We had seven students in the class. All of them are excellent dancers and will contribute greatly to the future of our club and square dancing in our area. As an indication of the timelessness of our favorite pastime, one of our new dancers originally started dancing in Austin, Texas, in the 1970s. She’s come back to dancing after a brief 40 year hiatus! Another new dancer is following in the footsteps of her grandparents, whom she remembers fondly as always enjoying square dances. She even has some of her grandmother’s hand-sewn skirts and crinolines! 
 
Our last dance before our summer break will be Saturday, June 4, at the Milwaukie Grange. Our caller will be Don Wood. We will be alternating Mainstream and Plus tips from 7:30 to 9:30. Starting in September, our dances will move to the second Saturday of the month, still at the Milwaukie Grange. That means our September dance will be on September 10, from 7:30-9:30 pm.
 
Finally, if you know someone who really has the itch to take square dance lessons but doesn’t want to wait until the fall, we are offering an 8-week series of lessons from June 1 through July 27 (no class June 29). We hope to make it through all 51 Basic calls during this class. The classes will take place from 7-9 pm at the Ankeny Street Studio, 975 SE Sandy Blvd., Portland 97214.
 
SYIAS!
