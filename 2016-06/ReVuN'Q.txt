Our first night of Tango class turned out five new students and 11 couples total. A great start to a new class. The class is for new students to learn the steps and for experienced couples to learn better technique. A win-win for all of us. Several dancers brought Cinco de Mayo goodies for the evening.

We continue to work songs on the ICBDA list. They are a good variety of current and classic songs. The last hour of the evening is Phase 4+ and easy Phase 5â€™s. We are getting ready for Spring Spectacular in Woodburn

Our birthday (#40) dance is June 16 from 7-9 p.m. It will be a fun evening of dancing with no instruction that night. The theme is Ruby. (color and stone) Come and join us for a fun night of dancing and giggles with friends. Marilyn Schmit
