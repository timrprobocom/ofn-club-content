Our April dances had an added benefit by helping out the Bonnie Hays Small Animal Shelter.  What a great way to start and finish out the month.  Lots of animal toys and food from the Toes will help out the animal population at the shelter.   Many visitations have come and gone since out last report.  We visited the Buzzing’ Bees’ for their 58thanniversary dance.  Once again KC their new caller made it into a fun evening as he always does.  April 22nd we picked up a banner visiting the Valley River Dancers in Newberg.  KC was their guest caller while Randy Dibble was out and about on his square dance cruise.  Earlier that month the Valley River Dancers hired a special driver to drive a square dance bus to pick up dancers along the way and travel to Roseburg, to dance with the Timber’s 8’s.   A few of the Toes were able to go and said it was a fun time.  We visited the Eager Beavers for their anniversary dance on April 24th.  They had a yummy chicken dinner and showed us all a wonderful time.  We have been a busy club, dancing out and about with great friends.
 We are glad Harlan Flint is back on the dance floor.  He had a health scare and now has a new stent in his heart.  Heard Bev was a great nurse for him.  Speaking of those two, they gave us a fun night of just round dancing and presented the new dancers with their graduation badges
 Our Let’s Race and Crazy Hat dance brought out the best of our creative ideas in our members. Hats, hats and more crazy hats.  We have such a fun group with all of their ideas and laughter.
 Come and dance with us to celebrate KC’s birthday on July 1st.  Dinner is served at 6:30 p.m. with BBQ Hot Dogs and Sausages.  See you in a square.
