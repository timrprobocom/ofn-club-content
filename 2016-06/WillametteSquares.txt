Many dancers came out for Willamette Squares' Maypole dance. It is always a festive occasion celebrating the arrival of spring and the anticipation of May flowers. Twenty people wove the colorful ribbons over and under, creating a lovely pattern of color around the Maypole. It is a joyful dance that is fun to do and/or watch. The Braids and Braves recovered one of their old banners. 

Our waltz lessons are coming along nicely. We will have successfully completed our round dance series of lessons soon. 

We are looking forward to honoring our Veterans on our regular dance the fourth Saturday in May. We are so very thankful for their service.
