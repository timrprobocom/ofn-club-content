The Happy Hoppers will host our last dance before going dark for the summer on Saturday, June 4, at the Clark County Square Dance Center with Jim Hattrick calling and cueing.   This will be our annual "Strawberry Shortcake Dance", so you don't want to miss that one!  

Our lessons are "dark" for the summer season, to resume in September.

Fay and I hosted two women from Japan for the month of April.  It was part of a sister city relationship between Vancouver, USA and Joyo, Japan, arranged by an organization which specializes in home stays for Japanese exchange students.  We had a great experience sharing our home, the English language, and our American culture with Nobuko Nakamura and Tamae Tanimura, who are both retired school teachers.  Square dancing was definitely one of the high points of their experience.  

They arrived on April 1.  The next evening, we brought them to a regular Saturday dance with the Hoppers.  They observed and had a great time meeting all the friendly club members, who made them feel very welcome.   When we got home, Tamae kept repeating one of Jim's calls, "Boys run around the girls", and chuckling about that.  I guess it does sound kind of funny!

Anyway, they were just in time to start a new session of beginning square dance lessons on Monday, April 4. That evening, and for the next 3 Mondays, Nobuko and Tamae were very enthusiastic students, overcoming a normal learning curve which was somewhat complicated by the language barrier.

When we had an open house toward the end of the month to wish them farewell, 16 of their new friends attended.  13 of those were square dancers.  How cool is that??
