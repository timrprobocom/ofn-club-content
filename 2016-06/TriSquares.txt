The Tri Squares have been very busy the last few months. During this time, we elected a new board, changed our dance dates and even added a few new members to our club.  We have seven new members, plus one returning member.

Make sure to note our new dancing dates!  We will now be dancing on the 2nd Saturday and 4th Friday starting in September.  Weâ€™re working on planning our Anniversary dance in September. Make sure to keep an eye out for this special event.

Our new board was approved at our board meeting in April. The board is as follows:
<ul>
<li>President: Linda Ray-Keeney
<li>Vice President: Deb Mandeville
<li>Secretary: Leslie Woodland 
<li>Treasurer: Bob Davis
<li>Dance Coordinator: Lynnea Loveberg
<li>TVC Representative: Frank Collett
</ul>

We look forward to another year of fun and fellowship. Thank you to those who attend our dances and make it special.
See you in a square,
Leslie Woodland
