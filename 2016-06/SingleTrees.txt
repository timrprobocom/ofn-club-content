We had a really good time in April having both KC Curtis and Chuck Garner as our guest callers. Jackie Gale, our regular cuer, did her usual great job, and we had the extra treat of having Christina Corelli cue for us at our second dance. Many of us attended the Dan Nordby dance as well as the Emerald Empire Council Benefit Dance for Honor Flight (with auction). They were both excellent dances and anyone who did not come missed some really good calling, cueing, and some great camaraderie.
Like many clubs in our area, we are having trouble filling our officer positions, as well as getting other club members to volunteer to help with dances and other tasks. We hope we can grow our club this coming year. Our club always has wonderful callers and cuers, and many visitors to help fill up our squares. We would love to welcome more members, both singles and couples.
On May 13th we will have had our Mexican Fiesta dance with the Whirl-A-Ways combining with us this year to dance to George Hermann and Mike Kious and to enjoy a yummy taco bar at the break. On May 27th Lennie Ludiker will be calling for us.
On June 10th we will have our fund raising dance for Greenhill and will be collecting supplies for orphan cats and dogs. Girls Night Out will be calling. Jim Hattrick will be back to call for our June 24th dance. As a reminder - we dance all summer for those of you looking for a place to dance when your club is dark.
As an FYI - In May and June Roger Putzler will be conducting Plus Workshops on the second and Fourth Thursdays at 7:00 p.m. If you are a Plus dancer and wish more floor time, challenge and FUN, please come to Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.
