R Square D celebrated our 63rd anniversary on April 8th.  Three squares kept the floor moving for the entire evening.  Outgoing president Sandy Sims was presented a gift for all her hard work over the last year. 
 Poodle skirts and rolled up sleeves on t-shirts all came out to celebrate the 50”s, 60”s dance on April 23rd.  Elvis impersonator Scott Coon made the evening one to remember with all the Elvis oldies.  Visitors came from Hayshakers and Cougar Squares to dance to the sounds of Elvis. Thank You Scott.
