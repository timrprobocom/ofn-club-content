The Hayshakers have been dancing twice a month and in fact, we had two squares at the last dance.  Of course we couldnâ€™t do it without the Wave Steppers helping us.  Also, we had four new people coming to learn to dance.  We are hoping to keep this up.  You do need to call ahead of time though as usual.
