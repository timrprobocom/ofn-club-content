Last month was great with wonderful callers and cuers. Our regular caller is Les Seeley and cuers Tami Helms and Doug Hatch.  Daryl Cledenin and KC Curtis called the 2nd and 4th Friday dance of the month.  Frances and Joyce were cuers for those two dances. 5 of our members went to the PAC dance.

We are looking forward to our summer dances since we don't go dark . We welcome couples and singles to our dances and best of all we see to it that everyone gets to dance.  Also we are looking forward to our summer picnic and other activities of summer.   Wishing everyone a great summer.
