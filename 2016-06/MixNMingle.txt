Keep in mind that we will celebrate the Fourth of July weekend with our annual Red, White, and Blue Dance on July 2 with red berries, blueberries, and homemade vanilla ice cream.  Come join us for an evening of great calling and yummy dessert.
 With weather warming up, be sure to check our website as to whether the temperature is too high for dancing when the thermometer shoots up.
 It's that time of year when elections are in the news.  Ours went more sedately than the national and state elections are going.  Dan Knierim is our new president, Patty Bonney the incoming vice president, Janelle Janicke will become the new secretary, Lindie Noonan will take over as treasurer, Sue Naven is now our immediate past president (a board position), and Patricia Billings is member-at-large.  She and Janelle will be our TVC delegates.
