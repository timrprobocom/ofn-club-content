Were you able to join us at our â€œGo Hog Wild Danceâ€ on March 18th?     Tim Kane, a Chaps & Petticoats member was also the Caller for the dance.  Tim donated a pig he had raised, and he was the butcher.  He also roasted the pig, carved the pig, then after the 6:45pm feast, Tim was the evening Caller.  It was incredible - we had 80+ people attend!!  Rounds opened at 7:30pm with Ken Pratt cueing and 8:00pm Tim called what must have been our liveliest dance of 2016, thus far.  â€œFeed them food and they will come!â€

On April 15, Mike and Julie Stout were our Caller/Cuer.  It was advertised as a casual â€œcome-as-you-areâ€ dance and we were blessed with a partial square of Sunset Promenaders plus the room was buzzing when members from the disbanded club, Squaws and Paws, started arriving.  Two squares later, we had us a hopping dance with four squares on the floor.  Wow, what support these clubs gave our Caller/Cuer of the evening.   Much thanks to all for a thrilling dance.

We look forward to our June dances:  â€œHey manâ€ it would be so cool if you could join us on Friday, June 3, at our â€œHippieâ€ Dance with the Caller dude Scott Zinser and Cheryl Manley, the Cuer chicâ€™.  On third Friday, June 17, our dance floor opens with Ken Pratt, cueing at 7:30pm and George Hermann is our Caller â€&ldquo; please honor us with your presence, as it is our last dance before we go â€œdarkâ€ for the summer.  	

What are you doing in July?  On July 16th Chaps & Petticoats serve Elephant Ears and specialty drinks in a food booth at the Hubbard Hop Festival â€&ldquo; it is our annual fundraiser.   The all-day event starts with a Parade at 10:00am, food and games throughout the day and after dark entertainment in the Beer Gardens.  We encourage you to turn out for a fun event and support our fundraising efforts. 

Happy Feet
