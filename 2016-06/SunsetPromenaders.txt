Sunset Promenaders are looking forward to our Square Dance students graduating and attending our dances and also hoping they will be joining with us on our visitations to other clubs in the area.  
 We have been using our new dance format since April and we invite you to come to our dances and enjoy our dance hall, and our friendly dancers.  Our dance schedule is Plus from 7:00 to 8:00 with intermediate rounds; after that we are dancing mainstream with phase two rounds from 8:00 until 10:00 with a break afterwards.  
 If you have not been here before, we have a nice wood floor, air-conditioning, with parking on the street and if necessary there is additional parking behind the bank across the street.  We enjoy visitors, come dance with us.  Our address is 267 E. Main Street in Hillsboro.
 First Saturday dance is June 4th with plus dance from 7: 00 until 8:00 and Mainstream from 8:00 until 10:00 features Mike Stout our club caller and Ken Pratt our club cuer.
