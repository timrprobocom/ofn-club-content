We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the dancers that have made our dances a success. We really enjoy having visitors.

Sorry to report that a long time dancer, Mary Slocum, has passed away. She was a member of the Golden Squares for several years.

Again on the 30th of May, we will have the usual great pie night.  Come join us!
