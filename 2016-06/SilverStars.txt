The Silver Stars will dance all summer on 4th Fridays with Darrell Kalmbach calling and Dorothy Lowder cueing.  Pre-rounds begin at 7 pm with plus from 7:30 - 8 pm and mainstream from 8 - 10 pm--all at Hazel Dell Grange.  Our dance theme for our June 24 dance is "Berries Galore" with icecream and berries being served at break.  Summertime brings many weekend events along with Washington and Oregon Summer Festivals for club members to attend as well as our club picnic.  Have a wonderful summer and happy dancing to all.
