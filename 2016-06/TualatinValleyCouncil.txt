On April 30th the TVC hosted a Spring Fling dance at the Aloha Grange.  There were nearly 10 squares of dancers enjoying the calling of Jim Hattrick and cueing of Ken Pratt.  We all had a wonderful time.  The Hoedowners claimed the TVC banner by having the highest percentage of their club present.
 The Council has elected officers for the upcoming year with President, Dale Brabham, Vice-President, Kathy Roberts, and Secretary, Andis Geruts, with Treasurer, Lane Clem continuing his role from last year.  The new State Delegate will be Jim Rogers.  Outgoing officers are Gary Clark, Dale Brabham, Tom Sminia, and Kathy Worthington.  Thank you for your dedication.  Our Council delegates are doing a fantastic job in bringing their clubs concerns to the Council as well as taking Council information to their clubs.
 The next TVC event will be our annual Hahn Barn Dance on Sunday, August 21st.  There will be a potluck picnic by the lake at 5:30 PM preceding the dance in the barn.  There will more details in future editions of the OFN.
 The Tualatin Valley Council will soon grow to 12 member clubs.  The Tualatin Timber Squares has petitioned the Council for membership.
