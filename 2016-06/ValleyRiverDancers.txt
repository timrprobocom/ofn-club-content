Aloha!  We are happy to observe that those of us who are Dibble Cruisers brought back some nice weather and sunny dispositions from our adventures in Hawaii. A tip of the hat to Joni, JW, Sandy, John, Lanny and Ginger, members of the Checkmates and frequent Valley River guests, for being fantabulous organizers and ambassadors for our trip. And, to the weather gods, thank you for the flat seas on the North Pacific!  We rocked the seas rather than vice Versa. Mahalo, Toe Draggers, for visiting our club and to Caller KC Curtis for filling in for Randy.

Join us in June on the second (plus) and fourth (mainstream) Fridays for squares and rounds at the Community Center, 2nd and Howard, in Newberg. All that cruising put a gleam in Randy's eyes, meaning he has certainly conjured up some spicy choreography for our upcoming dances. 

Pull out your calendars and make sure you've reserved Friday evening, July 22, for our annual Dance Under the Stars in Newberg. Catching up with friends and dancing with all of our happy, energetic guests make it an event we look forward to all year.

Please note that we will be dark the Friday of Memorial Day Weekend as we follow Randy to a calling gig in Bend
