We are now dark until our September dance. Thank you to everyone who came to our pie night dance in May.

We all had a great time at the Pacific Northwest Teen Square Dance Festival at the start of May!!! Mom promised that she would send in an article and pictures. Thank you to everyone who supported us this year. Julia & Logan send special thanks to Ken & Diane Pratt and Frances & Floyd Herigstad for all of the help with their round dance competition. We did film all of the competition and Mom will have the computer set up at dances we are attending so others can view the event. 
We will be getting out on some visitations over the summer. See you soon
