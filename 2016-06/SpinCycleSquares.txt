We are thrilled that more dancers are showing up on Sundays to dance with us from 5:30 - 8:00 p.m. with all levels being taught and danced.&nbsp; It's a lot of FUN as folks are discovering.&nbsp; Please join us. Tim Matteson, our caller/teacher, does an incredible job at any level. We dance at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield that has a wonderful cushioned wood floor and has all of the amenities to boot. Remember, we are dark May 29 for Memorial Day. Happy dancing!
