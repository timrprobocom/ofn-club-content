The Charlie Brown Squares are hosting the Boatnik Square Dance Festival May 27-29. Dan Nordbye and MaryAnn Callahan are the caller and cuer.  We are looking forward to a wonderful event!
We recently elected a new board of officers.  Our new officers are Randy Yoshida - President, Rikki Lobato - First Vice President, Joe Zimmer - Second Vice President, Louise Voss - Secretary and Debbie Gent - Treasurer. Phil Ramey and Carol Connors have graciously volunteered to be our Sunshine Committee.
A big "thank you" goes to our out going officers - Bob and Jeanne Lobato and Tom and Sandi Hansen. We appreciate all you did last year. Rikki and Debbie are staying on for another year.
Our September class graduated in March and we have held ongoing Mainstream Workshops on Tuesday evenings. We also have Plus workshop on Tuesday evenings. We have an A-1 class on Thursday evening.  It's an enthusiastic bunch learning A-1! Workshops &amp; A-1 class will continue until we go dark for August.
We have our Back to Basics dance on June 4th with Ray Holmes calling &amp; Mary Nutt cueing. This is our Mainstream dance with Plus every 3rd Tip.  We are dark on June 18th to support Circle N Squares Gold Diggers Dance in Yreka, CA.
