 Please join us for our Trophy Dance June 18th.  Yes, that is the actual date.  I write my report a month ahead of time and when the Board makes changes, I need to think back to what I wrote, and then think ahead and amend the report before it goes to pressâ€¦So sorry for the confusion.  Anyway, we are featuring Gary Monday, originally from Louisiana and now based in Seattle.  He has called nationally and internationally, and is a lot of fun.  Connie Clark will be cueing.  We will follow our new dance format: New Dancer Level 7-8; MS 8-9+ with tips getting increasingly difficult so we end with Plus.  Our Strawberry Dance is June 4th and will have the same format.
 In April we won a banner from Independence Wagon Wheelers when we visited their dance featuring Dan Nordbye.  Great food and good fellowship made the drive in the rain worth it.  We also brought a nice contingent to the Oaky Doaks Jamboree and to Tualatin Timbers' first dance at Winona Grange. 
 Our April dances with the new format were successful enough that the Board voted to continue with that format through the summer.  Please encourage your students and new dancers to get in floor time at a real dance.
