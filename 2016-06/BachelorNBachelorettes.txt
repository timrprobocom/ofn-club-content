Our April 13th Anniversary Dance may have been a milestone for our club.  Six callers were on stage at once.  (We had eight callers attend, but we didnâ€™t want the stage to collapse.)

Many clubs close down over the summer, but our club usually reaps the benefits by getting visitors who would not normally come.  They come because their own clubs have gone dark.  This is part of our savvy marketing.
