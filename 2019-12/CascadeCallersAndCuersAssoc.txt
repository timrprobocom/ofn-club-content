Our next scheduled dance is February 29 (Leap Year!) at the dance center in Springfield.  The members of CCCA will call and cue a fun dance for you! The floor in our hall is cushioned and so nice to dance on.  

Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli will hold a New Year's Eve dance for only $2.50 a person.  8:30 - Pre-Rounds and 9:00 Mainstream and Plus Dance with Rounds.  Please bring a pie if you wish. Callers and cuers who attend may call and cue a tip if they wish.  Bring your music!  We'll welcome in 2020! 

Keep on calling and cueing for fun,
Christina Corelli
CCCA Secretary
