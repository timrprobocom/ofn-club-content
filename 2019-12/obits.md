Benjamin Brown and his wife, Penny, contributed lots of time and effort to the business side of square and round dancing in Oregon for many years.  Benjamin served as President of the Oregon Federation of Square and Round Dance Clubs in 1993 and 1994. He also served as the Federation's Parliamentarian for for many years, and as the Portland Area Council’s representative to the Federation.
He also served as President of the Bachelor & Bachelorettes Square Dance Club.

In 1989, when Oregon won its bid to host the 43rd National Square Dance Convention in 1994 in Portland, Benjamin & Penny jumped right on the jobs that needed to be done.  Penny was the secretary for the whole team.  General Chairman Don White appointed Benjamin as the Assistant General Chairman.  Benjamin served on the Oregon Trail Board, Communication Committee and numerous other segments of the 4-year effort to prepare for 22,000 dancers to descend on the Twin Towers Convention Center.

Penny passed away a few years after the Convention.  Benjamin married Loretta Traveler a few years after that.  They spent several years sightseeing around the United States and Europe.  Four years ago, Benjamin’s health began to deteriorate, and Loretta became his caretaker.  Lots of doctoring could not determine the cause of the deterioration.  

Benjamin died peacefully in the Boise, Idaho, Military Hospital on November 12, 2019.
