Our 35th birthday dance was a success with lots of people dancing to our fun caller, Randy and special guest cuer, Sherri.  There was cake and ice cream from Dan, jars of M&M’s to guess the count from Lindie and goodies to snack on from Rick and Robin.  The grange was decorated with M&M containers (gifts from dancers), balloons and pillows made by Lindie’s mom.  
 Come join us, on December 21st for our annual Canned Food Dance!  In our earlier days we gave people a discount for bringing canned food but soon decided to switch to a greater need - Teddy Bears for kids in crisis.  Police and fire stations were happy to have the toys to pass out but eventually, with other groups joining in the collecting of stuffed animals, they had more than they could use.  At that point we switched back to the Canned Food Dance.  The stage was decorated with the donations and after the dance they went into the Grange's barrel for the Oregon Food Bank.  Everything goes to those in need. What a great way to  help others.
 We’d love to see you there - - - Merry Christmas
