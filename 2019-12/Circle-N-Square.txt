Greetings from Yreka. It has been very busy in our small corner of the world the past few weeks. Sherrie and I attended Harvest Hoedown in Yuba City and had a terrific time! I want to stop any possible rumors that may have been started. We (CnS ) are NOT folding. We sent in dues to the Federation for 17 members. You may, or will have heard things, and it will be up to you to decide what to believe. We held a special general membership meeting on Nov. 7th. There were several people who volunteered to fill vacated positions on our board of directors, and vacated officer positions. We will hold another meeting in Dec. to make theses nominations official. At this point in time we will not be holding any club party nights until after the first of the year. We hope to continue to have our dances at Evergreen Elementary School. Elaine has agreed to cue rounds for us. We hope to continue to offer Advanced, M/S and Plus to those attending. As well as Rounds. As long as the weather is good.

Sherrie and I are holding and sponsoring new dancer classes at the Karuk Wellness Center.  We have filed the necessary paper work with the Karuk tribe. We have 8 new dancers and 5 returning dancers. We are doing a lot of 6 couple, and Cecillian Circle. We are planning on having our annual Christmas party ornament exchange and dance on Dec 23. This will be student level, and held at the Wellness Center.
