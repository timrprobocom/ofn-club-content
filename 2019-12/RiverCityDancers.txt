In October, we added two new speakers to the back of our hall, so we now have “Surround Sound”. Come dance with us and enjoy the great sound.

Our students are progressing well in their lessons, and at our first dance in November (November 9) we honored them and other new dancers with a new dancer Jamboree and a “lightly used” clothing sale. The wonderful volunteers from the “Quilts of Valor “were also there to help us honor and thank some of our military veterans on Veterans day week, with the presentation a handmade quilt to each of them. 

Our first dance in December will be a holiday theme dance followed by a regular dance the next week. We will also be having our annual holiday dinner that month. We dance every second and third Saturday at Milwaukie Community Center at 43nd and Jackson. Come join us.
