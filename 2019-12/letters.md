The Hayshakers and Sunset Promenaders thank all who attended the 2019 Seaside Sashay.  Thanks to all of you it was one of the biggest and best ever.  We even had dancers from Denver, Colorado and Canton, Georgia dancing with all of us from Oregon and Washington.  Some dancers let us know that the dance floor wasn’t optimal for gliding smoothly through all the tips and rounds.  We are working with the Convention Center Staff to improve the floor condition for our 20th Anniversary in 2020.  We are also looking at finding a vendor to sell dance socks which seems to be a workable solution for “sticky floor” syndrome.  Even though the floor was a little sticky inside, dancing was great at the end of the Lewis & Clark trail and the factory outlet mall and nothing could dampen the enthusiasm of our mud wrestling competition.  Kelly McCaw won handily in the women’s division and Ron Larson muscled through the competition to capture the men’s championship.  Ron declined Kelly’s challenge to see which of them would prevail in a winner takes all competition.

With planning underway for our 20th Seaside Sashay, we know you will be pleased to hear we have booked perennial favorites Ray Brendzy and Richard Lane to call and Debbie Taylor to cue.  Our registration forms are already posted at some dance venues but if you want to print a few, just call Joyce & Gary at 503-647-5742 or e-mail us at gaclark42@gmail.com and you will have a printable copy very quickly.

Yes, our 20th annual Seaside Sashay on October 23 & 24, 2020 should be a very special event with all the usual events including mud wrestling, the passport promenade, after hours dining venues, phenomenal split the pot opportunities, at least 20 door prizes and let us not forget the Round and Square dancing.  We will be looking at improving our schedule over the next few months as we continue planning this great event to give you even more of the requested dancing opportunities.

Thanks again to everyone who joined us in Seaside, hope to see you in October 2020!

							Joyce & Gary Clark,
							Sylvia Davis
							Dale & Kathy Worthington
							Cynthia Weber
