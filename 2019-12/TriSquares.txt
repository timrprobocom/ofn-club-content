In October Tri Squares went full speed ahead with Two Step (2 pm) and Mainstream (3:30) lessons on Sunday afternoons at the Grange.  Plus we visited Mix ‘N Mingle for their 35th anniversary, and some of us attended the Seaside Sashay while others held our Halloween dance, “Come As You Aren’t”.
 On December the 8th we’re having our annual holiday party and dinner-out, including the white elephant gift exchange for some good laughs!  Our lessons are suspended in December but we’re having two dances; “Sounds of the Seasons” Christmas dance on Friday the 13th, and “Winter Wonderland” black and white ball on Friday the 27th, with our caller Terry Halley and cuer Sandra Pinion. 
 Happy holidays to everyone!
