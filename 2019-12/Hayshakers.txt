The Hayshakers would like to thank the Sunset Promenaders as we worked with them to make the Seaside Sashay a success.  And also we thank all of the clubs who attended.  You all are what made it a success.  We are continuing with classes, and third and fifth Friday dances.  Our dance on December 20th will feature Mark Wheeler calling.
