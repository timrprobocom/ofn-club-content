Thank you to everyone who joined us for our Ham Dinner Dance in November. We had a great meal and then enjoyed dancing to Leonard and Frances.

Thomas graduated his students from his summer class and we are doing our best to make sure they get out to the new dancer dances as well as helping to angel our current class. Watch for our flyers for our new dancer dance in January. It is also our Baked Potato dinner!

We are planning to have two squares go to competition this year in Auburn, Washington. Soooooo... we are doing visitations (and showing off our current trophies), selling festival pins and we will have the raffle tickets available soon. Since we are traveling this year, we do have to raise more funds. Please plan to join us for our fundraiser dance on March 22. Watch for more information to come. See you at a dance soon.
