We had a festive and well-attended Halloween Dance in October. Our mainstream lessons are continuing under Bruce and Judy's excellent guidance and we look forward to the start of the Area New Dancers' Dances. We're excited about December when we're holding our Christmas Dance and we're looking forward to dancing in the New Year! Wishing Happy Holidays to all! Karen
