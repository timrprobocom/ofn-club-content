Our October "Spooky Dance" was lots of fun, most of our members dressed up in costume.  We had quit a few visitors.  The dance was mostly at Mainstream level with a Plus tip at the end as most of our visitors were at Mainstream level.  We take a consensus of the dancers toward 8:30 pm to see what level they want, that way everyone can dance.  
 Valley Squares is going DARK for December as our dance is so close to Christmas.  We will be DARK for January as well.  We will start our dances up again on Saturday, February 15th, 7 pm and will start our classes on Tuesday's in February 2020 with Feb 4th & 11th lessons free, 7-9 pm.  All at the Aloha Grange.
