The Ramblers were thrilled to receive a visitation from the Oaky Doaks at our November 9 dance, with Diana Wedel from Seattle calling. It was so much fun to dance with new and old friends, and the Oaky Doaks brought lots of energy and enthusiasm to the dance. We are already planning a visit back to the ODs to reciprocate—probably next spring!
 
The Oaky Doaks were the second club to earn a Ramblers banner with a visitation in 2019. The first person who correctly names the other club that received a Ramblers visitation banner in 2019 will receive one free admission to a Ramblers monthly dance of their choice.
