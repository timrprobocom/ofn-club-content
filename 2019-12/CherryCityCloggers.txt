We are quite excited about our beginning clogging group. They continue to be quite consistent every week and are doing very well. They will graduate just before Christmas. We are excited to see our numbers growing in our intermediate class as well. We usually see 10-15 cloggers come consistently every week.

We have just completed our election of officers and they will take their new positions on January 1, 2020. Mary Ellen Ramsayer will remain as our president; our new Vice President will be Rolita LaForge, Secretary Pam Seacrest, Treasurer Miranda Mann and Area Representative Cathy Drawson. 

We are also very excited about receiving an invitation to dance at Magic at the Mill on Friday December 20 from 5:45 - 6:30 p.m. This is a part of the Christmas extravaganza at Mission Mill. We have not done this before, so we are all looking forward to being a part of it. Georganne
