 So why is October the 10th month of year when octa refers to 8; octopus, octagon, octave?  It’s just one of life’s mysteries.  However, October is the month of football, autumn leaves, golden sunsets, homecoming dances and the Hoedowners Sock Hop Dance which was held on the 12th.  Did you ever dance in your socks for real?  My memory comes up blank on that one.  Wendy Peterman won the Split the pot but the Spin It to Win It went unclaimed.
 Hoedowners got their hips swaying as we headed west to the 2019 Seaside Sashay.  By my count we had 24 Hoedowners in attendance.  The weather was good and there was dancing at the turnaround Saturday morning.  Friday evening the Hoedowners met for dinner at Finns.  The meal was great as usual and the laughter was abundant.  Thank heavens we had time to finish dining, change our clothes and head over to the Seaside Convention Center for the last dance of the weekend.  Most of the Hoedowners were outfitted in the green vests advertising Summer Festival 2020!
 What lies ahead in December?  On December 14th we’ll have our annual Soup Dance.  The aroma is heavenly as all our great cooks create tasty, liquid offerings.
 The next day, Sunday December 15th, is our New Dancer Jamboree at 1 pm.  Please join us.
 We will wrap up 2019 on the December 28th in our coziest loungewear for our Pajama Dance; sweats, nightgowns, robes, onesies, baby dolls, all are welcome.  Teddy bears, pillows and blankies are optional.
