Happy Holidays to everyone! As we head into the holidays we are also entering into our new dancer dance season. Make sure you are encouraging your students to attend these dances at their level AND YOU ARE GOING WITH THEM! They need to know that there will be someone they already know at the dance. Offer to give a ride or meet them there.

Before letting your students or newer dancers go off to a dance, please consider going over some common etiquette for square dancers. Make sure you give them a chance to ask questions ahead of time on what they may experience.

Square dancers pride themselves on being friendly, courteous and honest on and off the dance floor. Following is a few items to remember when attending a square dance:

*	Bathe diligently and refrain from garlic and alcohol prior to dancing.
*	Wear proper square dance attire.  You will see many styles on a square dance floor from the longer prairie-type skirts to the short petticoated dresses. Any mention of "full attire required" means that ladies will be expected to wear some sort of dress/skirt, men will be expected to wear long sleeves and that any attire, as always, should be neat and clean. Check all hats at the door. Hats can be dangerous and eyes have been damaged by their brims. Check advertising on the dance – this may be a special “theme” dance and costumes may be encouraged.
*	Wear a name badge. There are a lot of people to meet and badges help refresh the memory.
*	Show up on time. You will need to sign in and have time to greet those you know and make a new friend.
*	**Join the nearest square needing a couple. Do not pass by a square needing a couple to join another square.**  Introduce yourself as if no one in the square knows you. A stranger is just a friend whom you haven't met yet. Avoid cliques and give others the chance to meet and dance with you.
*	**Do not go through a square on your way to another square** – go around.
*	Recognize your corner, not only what she/he is wearing, but who she/he is. Next to your partner she/he is the most important person in your square.
*	Remember who you are every time you square up -- heads, sides and what couple (1, 2, 3 or 4).
*	Listen to the caller. Even if you know what he's going to say, someone else in the square may not. After a tip, applaud the caller and thank your fellow dancers.
*	Keep smiling even if you are angry with yourself for "goofing". The other seven people in the square may think you are frowning at them.
*	Forgive other dancers if they "goof". We all get our turn and next time it may be yours!
*	**Never walk out on a square!** This is the cardinal sin of square dancing. Ask for help and let others help you. If you walk out of the square then nobody gets to dance.
*	Regular square dancing is not a competition. Don't speed through the calls or perform time-consuming "cutesy styling". High flung kicks can be dangerous to those around you. There is plenty of time to learn any “extras”. Don’t force a newer dancer into styling that they have not experienced – let them watch and come to you with a question on how to do something.
*	Be gentle, especially with the ladies, but not so gentle that you become a "limp noodle."

For those of you who attend Mid-Winter Festival each year, please make sure that the newer dancers and students in your club/classes are aware of the festival and that there are halls where they can dance at their level. This is a great opportunity to meet others from around the state, out of state or even another country!
