Wow! 2019 is almost at an end. We are dancing the year away with an added dance in December. We will dance the first Friday, and the third Friday is our New Dancer Christmas Dance, plus we are having a New Year's Eve Dance on December 31. This dance will be at the VFW hall at 630 Hood St. NE in Salem.  Puttin' on the Ritz is the theme. Tickets are only $8.00 per dancer. See the flyer for more information. Tickets will be on sale at all of our dances. See you all on the dance floor. Sheila Machado
