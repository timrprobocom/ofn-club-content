In October we had two really fun dances on our regular dance nights 2nd and 4th Fridays.  They were about equally attended with three squares on the floor most of the time.  As with many clubs we are seeing the numbers dwindle.  Again the new dance format seems to be working out okay with many ands staying to clean up after 10 and the announcements are over.  Still there are some who need to leave early or don’t stay for announcements. 

Jim Hattrick called our regular dance Oct. 11 with Jackie Gale cueing.  George Hermann called our Halloween dance on Oct. 25 with Jackie Gale cueing.  We are so delighted with the callers and our cuer who do such a great job of calling and cueing and keeping our dancers happy.  Our Halloween dance as always had some fun costumes (see photos in the photo section).

In December we will hold our annual Christmas potluck dinner and dance with dinner at 6:30 and dancing commencing at 7:30 as usual.  The club provides the ham and rolls; dancers provide the rest.  It is always a tasty meal and fitting for the holiday season in our beautifully decorated hall.  Please come join us for the dinner, the dance or both. Jim Hattrick will call and Jackie Gale will cue that dance on Dec. 13.  Our Dec. 27 dance will feature K.C. Curtis and Jackie Gale.

P.S. If you are reading this on or before Nov 22 please come join us for our Western Hoedown and Chili feed with Darrell Kalmbach and Jackie Gale.  This should be a fun one and we are not back to back with Thanksgiving—still dancing can burn off calories!
