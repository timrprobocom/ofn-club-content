Oak Hills Squares are continuing lessons on Monday nights at 6:30 PM.  We have several new students who are making good progress.
 Renee Ruud was our caller for two dances in October while our caller, Lane Clem and Marie vacationed in sunny California.
 Our Guy Fawkes Dance on Nov 4 was a great success.  Dancers wore red, white and blue, which happen to be England’s colors as well as the good ole’ US.  Guy Fawkes is a notorious English renegade, whose capture and execution is celebrated on November 5th with fireworks and wearing of masks.  Since we have British members, we felt it a good alternative to the typical Halloween theme.  So many interesting British refreshments; English flapjacks are NOT like American pancakes!  Guy was there is effigy, asking for pennies, and fireworks were lit outside after the dance. 
 We hope to see a lot of ugly sweaters at our theme dance on December 2nd, where refreshments will be available during open break.
 Please join TVC’s newest club on Mondays from 6:30 to 8:30.  The first hour will be the lesson for new dancers (we always welcome angels), and mainstream dancing with phase two rounds will follow for the second hour.  Square dancing attire is encouraged, but optional on the first Monday of every month, when the dance is all singing calls.
 Let’s keep on dancing!
