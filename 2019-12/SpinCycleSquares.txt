 We dance almost every Sunday at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.  5:30 - 8:00.  We dance all levels.  Our caller, Tim Matteson, will adjust the levels according to who shows up to dance.  It's always FUN, and we always have a lot of FOOD!  We encourage all square dancers to join us!  The floor is cushioned and socomfortable to dance on! We even have heat and air conditioning!

Please call Tim at 541-988-0399 or David at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are dancing.  We are dark once in a blue moon, but we'd hate to miss you.

We were dark November 24, a Sunday, because the annual special dance with Kris Jensen was held the day before, a Saturday.  Wow! What a dance, potluck and silent auction!  Whew!

Keep on dancing,
Christina Corelli
