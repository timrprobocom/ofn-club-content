Rogue Sis Q Council remains active dancing at the local clubs and beyond. We will be seen at a round Dance party on December 6th at Rogue Valley Square Dance Hall with Elaine Funk, Bob Dingman, and Rikki Lobato cueing every level of round dancing you can imagine.  The next day, Charlie Brown Squares have a birthday dance December 7th at Josephine County Square Dance Center. The Charlie Brown birthday dance has always been a great time to get together for dancing, fellowship, and fun.  Star Promenaders are having a New Years Eve dance/party celebrating at New York time so everyone can beat the heavy traffic home.  Then January 10th is the annual Pajamarama Student Level Dance at Josephine County Square Dance Center.  Rogue Sis Q Callers and Cuers will be presenting a great variety of dances for students and experienced dancers. I encourage everyone to attend and join the fun.


Rogue Sis Q Council Has their next meeting December 3rd at 4:30, Round Table Pizza, Medford
