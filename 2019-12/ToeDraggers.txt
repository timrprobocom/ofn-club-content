Our "Man Enough to Wear Pink" dance on October 6th was a great success.  We raised $2,300.00 for OHSU Knight Cancer Institute for Cancer Research.  Thank you for supporting this dance.
 The Toes went dark on the 3rd Friday of October and adventured off on a mystery trip.  We ended up at the Hayshakers to dance, and stayed at an Astoria Bed and Breakfast.  It was great fun.
 Toe Draggers New Dancer Jamboree will be on the first Friday, December 6th during our regular dance time.  K.C. Curtis is the caller and Bev Flint will be cueing.  Bring your students and come join us!  Kinton Grange, 19015 SW Scholls Ferry Rd - 7:30 pre-rounds, 8:00 class level with easy rounds.
 Then on the December 20th third Friday we are back to our normal format, Mainstream with one plus level tip at mid-dance.  The theme for this dance is Winter Wonderland.
 Our canned food drive is continuing.  Please bring non-perishable food to the dance for donation to the Grange's food baskets.  Thank you.
 Wishing all of you a Happy Holiday season.
