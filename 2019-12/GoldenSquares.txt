Hello!  I can’t believe it is time for the December issue. I would like to invite everyone to our Pie Night this month on Monday December 30 at “The Estates” auditorium in Woodburn.

Golden Squares is a tiny club of five dancers of which one is a snowbird! We manage alright but we need help with attendance. We have an excellent dance floor. Randy Dibble is our caller and Julie Stiers is our cuer on the first and fifth Mondays and Sherry Clark cues on the third Monday. 

Thank you to everyone who came to last Pie Night and the Crew Dance. We had a lot of fun. Hope to see you in a square soon. Merry Christmas. Teija
