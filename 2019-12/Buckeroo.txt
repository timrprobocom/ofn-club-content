Fall has officially arrived here in the Umpqua Valley. The leaves are turning bright colors and the air is crisp and cool. Another clue that fall is upon us is the beginning of a new cycle of mainstream classes here at the Buckeroo Barn. Mainstream classes are now closed, and we are helping prepare our students for their first “big dance” at Mid-Winter. 

We are gearing up for our annual wreath sale. This is our largest fundraiser of the year. Our members make beautiful wreaths to decorate your door over the holiday season. We are trying to be creative and add a few more opportunities to raise money to support the barn. In December, we will have our Holiday Craft Bazaar, so watch our website for details. There will be gift wrapping, visits with Santa, and concessions on hand during the event. Plan to come shop, or if you are a crafter, contact us to rent a table.  All proceeds from fundraising helps pay our taxes, insurance, repairs, and general upkeep of the barn.

See you in a square,
