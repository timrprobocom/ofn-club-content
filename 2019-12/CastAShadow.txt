We held 3 dances in the month of October.  The second dance featured Kris Jensen from Albuquerque who made a quick diversion through town to call for us and Spin Cycle Squares.  We love dancing to her smooth calling. 

When we do not have a live caller, we dance to recorded tips by national callers.  We have changed our dance times and are now dancing 2-4PM on the Sundays we dance.  We generally dance two squares on the floor in Hall B at the Emerald Square Dance Center with its cushioned wood floors.  The speakers in Hall B are excellent and hearing enhancement is available.  If you are in the area or passing through, please check our website (cas-sq.yolasite.com) to see if we are dancing.  We may cancel if there are not enough dancers planning on attending any given dance.  You may also call (541) 741-4149 to check.

We have also been offering C1 lessons on the days before our advanced dances from 1-2PM Sundays, or in Junction City on the alternate Sundays.  If you want to brush up on your C1, please come join us.
