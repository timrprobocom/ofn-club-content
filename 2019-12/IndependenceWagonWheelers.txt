We are more and more excited about our new class of Mainstream students! Their energy, enthusiasm, positive attitude, and progress in dancing make our Sunday evening lessons a real delight. George Hermann, instructor and club caller, is challenging them with three to four new calls per week, and they are eating it up – learning the moves and beginning to dance with style. We have 25 students and wonderful angel participation by our club members. The Salem Hospital venue is ideal, and we greatly appreciate the opportunity to offer our lessons there. Continued kudos to Membership Coordinators Dave O’Neill and Lee Ashwill!  

 The proceeds from our Christmas Dance silent auction will support Windsor House, homes for brain injured adults, and we are collecting cans of decaf coffee for the Windsor House kitchens – our annual December service project. 

Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays of each month at the Polk County Fairgrounds.  Especially be sure that you mark your calendars for our special dances:  December 14 Christmas Dance with Silent Auction and visit from Santa and Mrs. Claus; February 8 “Mix it up” Dance; March 8 (Sunday) IWW 60th Birthday Dance. 

Looking ahead: Mystery trip (date to be determined); Salvation Army bell ringing December 9 – 12 (at Macy’s); Annual Koast Krash April 24 – 26 (Yachats Inn. Theme: At the Hop). Dee Mackaman
