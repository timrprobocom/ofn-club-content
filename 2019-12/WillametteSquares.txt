Willamette Squares celebrated its birthday dance with a Halloween themed dance. Dancers were encouraged to come in costume, which the majority did and that added to the fun! Throughout the Square Dance Center were spiders, skeletons, and pumpkins aglow with flickering light. Of course, there was an abundance of candy corn at every table. Shariâ€™s deviled eggs topped with black olive spiders were a hit as well as the punch bowl with an icy hand floating in it. The dance was lively and spooktacular! We were pleased with the turnout and thank everyone involved for helping us celebrate our birthday. 

We are looking forward to our new dancer dance on Sunday, Dec. 1, which will be an afternoon dance. It will include a sizable used clothing sale so be expecting some bargains. See you in a square! Jodee Howard
