     Wow!  About four squares of Hoppers had a terrific time dancing and renewing acquaintances with square dance friends at the Seaside Sashay.  Although it may have been hard to count all of our members since many of them have dual club memberships and do not always wear their Hopper badges, we were there in force having a great time.  The weekend was made possible by the wonderful people who volunteer their time and talents to make this event happen.  We owe them all a huge “Thank you!”  The callers, Craig Abercrombie and Adam Christman, and the cuer, Debbie Taylor, were the frosting on the cake making the Seaside Sashay truly memorable.  Next up on our horizon is the Mid-Winter Festival.

     At our December 7th dance we will still be collecting gifts for children being served by the Children’s Center, a non-profit organization that provides mental health care to children of low-income families.  For the past several years we have collected toys for the Children’s Center at the last dance in November and at the first dance in December. The generosity of our square-dancing members and guests has made a difference for a lot of children.  Our final dance of 2019, December 21st, will be a Christmas dance with holiday music and Christmas cookies and treats for the break.  It’s always one of the more colorful and fun dances of the year.
     This last year and a half has been a time of transition and trying new ideas for the Hoppers. We are now confident and comfortable in our new home and looking forward to another wonderful year of dancing and sharing memories with friends and fellow dancers. We’re wishing all our square-dancing friends and families a joyous holiday season and a wonderful 2020.
