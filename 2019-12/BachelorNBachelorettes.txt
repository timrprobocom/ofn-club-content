     Good things are coming up this month.  National caller Kris Jensen will be with us Nov 27, with Tami Helms cueing.  We’ll have a New Dancer Jamboree on our regular dance night Dec 11.  It will also give new dancers a sample of round dancing by our club cuer, Tami Helms.   Our basket raffle will be Dec 18, with Craig Abercrombie calling and Tami Helms cueing.

     Bonus night will be Dec 27 featuring our New Dancer workshop and reviews.  We don’t normally dance on a Friday night, so this will be a night to experience.

     Our president and taw represented us at the Indio dance festival.  Several Cut-Ups also came.  100 squares were in attendance.

     We’ve heard that former member Benjamin Brown passed away in November.
