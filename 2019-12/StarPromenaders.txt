Don’t forget the chart-topping event in July at Diamond Lake. We will have a real “TRIFECTA” and a bonus with 3 callers of National Status. We will have Mike Sikorsky, Michael Kellogg and Mike Haworth with the bonus of Rikki Lobato as the featured cuer.

The “Game Night” held on November 8th was well attended. As usual, everyone ate too much, but had a good time nonetheless. Come out and join us on January 3rd for the next one. The theme will be “Cold Weather Comfort Food.”  It is a “Hoot.” If you don’t play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on; and we are open to most any table game.

Classes are going good and the students are really enthusiastic.

On November 15th, there was another “Back to Basics” dance. Dean Black was the caller. All who attended had a great time.

On November 21st, the Stars Class will host their Annual Thanksgiving Potluck. Then on November 23rd will be the club Thanksgiving dance. December 19th is the Stars’ Class Christmas Potluck. Besides the free Potluck Dinner, there will be a White Elephant Gift Exchange. Of course, there is always dancing around the Christmas Tree.
