Council clubs are encouraging their dancers to attend the anniversary dances of member clubs and the effort seems to be working.  On October 5th the Sunset Promenaders celebrated their 34th Anniversary with a full house.  The anniversary dance featured callers Mike Stout and Darrell Kalmbach with Ken Pratt and Julie Stout cueing to 134 dancers.  The Hoedowners were awarded a banner for having over two squares in attendance.
 A report from the Mix 'N Mingle indicated a well attended 35th anniversary dance with Randy Dibble calling and guest cuer Sherri Clark on the 19th of October.
 The annual Seaside Sashay on October 25th and 26th hosted by two TVC clubs, Hayshakers and Sunset Promenaders, was a big success.  This dance featured Craig Ambercrombie and Adam Christman calling and Debbie Taylor cueing to a record 247 dancers.
 The next Council event in December will be our annual New Years Eve dance at the Hillsboro IOOF Hall.  Darrell Kalmbach and Sherri Clark will be calling and cueing the dance which will begin at 8:45 with pre-plus.  The dance will continue with Mainstream at 9:00 until 12:15 with every third tip plus.  See flyer below.
 Since the OFN is published around the 20th of November, you may still have time to plan on the TVC fifth Saturday Dance, held at the Aloha Grange on November 30th.  This dance will feature Mike and Julie Stout calling and cueing.  The dance begins with pre-rounds at 7:30 followed by Mainstream with rounds at 8:00.  Every third tip will be Plus.  This dance is co-hosted by our brand new club to the TVC, the Oak Hills Squares.
