Happy Fall to our dancing friends. Hopefully you will enjoy your Thanksgiving meal next week and the Christmas holidays to follow.

Our club has voted to go dark on December 26 to enjoy more time with family wherever they may be. The OFN has been changed to show we are not dancing that night.

A rhythm has been picked for our Showcase for Mid-Winter and we have been working on learning whatever moves we are not comfortable with so we look good for the audience.
 
We have completed the phase 3 & 4 moves in Rumba and will continue to review as time goes by. We will be deciding on what comes next soon. 

We played for the Halloween dance event. Stephanie Lozano had some related music and we danced them for something different to do. Goodies were brought and we had a good time. We are hoping that by the time this goes to print that Stephanie loses the boot on her foot. She sprained her ankle at Seaside Sashay and it is taking time for it to heal again. We need to wrap her in bubble wrap to keep her healthy. Happy, healthy holidays to all of you. Marilyn Schmit
