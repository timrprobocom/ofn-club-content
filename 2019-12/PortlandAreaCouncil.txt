Our council website has been updated with our fifth Friday dances, and will also be reflected on the federation website.  You can find a calendar of PAC events and anniversary dances by clicking on the thumbnail to the left.

Our PAC holiday dinner is set for Monday, December 16, at the Old Spaghetti Factory at Clackamas Town Center, 6:PM.

By council resolution, our fifth Friday dances will now be hosted by our member clubs.
