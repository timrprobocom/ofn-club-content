Well, the Seaside Sashay was well attended by members of the Columbia River Dancers.  We had a great time dancing and enjoyed our annual pizza feed on Saturday.  A nice thing about the Sashay is we get to dance with friends from near and far.  Danced with a couple from Bend and one from Spokane.
 Our December dances will feature Mike and Julie Stout on December 14th and our own Jim Hattrick on the 28th.
 We will be sponsoring a New Yearâ€™s Eve dance for Adam Christman, Jim Hattrick, and Craig Abercrombie (also know as the Front Porch Trio) at the Hazel Dell Grange.  Jim will do pre-rounds from 8:30 until 9:00 and mainstream with plus added from 9 to midnight.
 Our promise is that everyone gets to dance.  So, if you are a single please come join us.
 Lastly, a special thanks to Gary and Judi Ferguson for being our club's representative to the TVC.
 To all, Happy New Year. Hope to see you soon.
