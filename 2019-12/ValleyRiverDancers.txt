The Valley River Dancers dance Plus on 2nd Fridays (Randy Dibble Calling, Ken Pratt Cueing), and Mainstream on 4th Fridays (Randy Dibble Calling, Sherri Clark Cueing) in Newberg at the Chehalem Community Center.  https://www.valleyriverdancers.org
 A round dance workshop continues preceding our 2nd Friday Plus Dance, led by Ken and Dianne Pratt, beginning at 6:30 pm.  Bring your round dance questions to the pros and allow them to help you smooth out your dance figures.
 Our mainstream lessons are continuing under Randy’s superb guidance. Our four students are making great progress.  Our New Dancer / Christmas Dance will be the 4th Friday, December 27th.  Although this dance will be at Mainstream level, Randy will call to the floor level to accommodate new dancers.  Traditionally we play a game involving a gift exchange, and so we encourage dancers to bring a wrapped gift of no more than $5 to exchange.  
 Complimentary sodas are offered to square dancers after our dances at Abby’s Legendary Pizza in Newberg.
 We wish everyone happy and safe holidays, and really hope to see you in a square soon!
