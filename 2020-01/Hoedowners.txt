 I’ll always remember this November for its dry, sunny days and spectacular sunsets.  Although the days are short this time of year with square dancing as a hobby or avocation we’ve always something to do and somewhere to go in the evenings. 
 The Aloha Grange was attacked and boarded by a group of nefarious brigands on the 9th.  In short, it was The Hoedowner’s Pirate Dance.  There were skeletal pirates guarding several locations in the building armed with muskets and swords.  The upper deck was awash with booty and fleeting glimpses of familiar looking pirates.  The scallywags on the captured galleon were properly dressed in pirate apparel adorned with gold doubloons, tricorn hats, cutlasses, pistols and an eye patch or two.  Pirate fare was the order of the evening in the dining room with a huge pumpkin stuffed with homemade dirty rice as the centerpiece.  Hope you didn’t miss it!
 Was that a gobble I heard?  Yes it was if you were at the Hoedowners Annual Turkey Toss on the 23rd.  When the tossing began, the benches on either side of the ballroom were jammed with hopeful participants, the corn hole boards were set out and the bean bags distributed.  Which is the better method; overhand, underhand, with your eyes open or closed?  I couldn’t ascertain a pattern of success and I threw mine completely off the boards but winners abounded taking home small, medium and large turkeys, a couple pairs of Cornish game hens and a ham.  To the delight of everyone attending a light turkey dinner was served in the dining room following the dance.  Did I mention the Sunset Promenaders were out in force?  They took home their fair share of poultry.
 January 2020 looms ahead.  We’ll have our New Year’s Resolution Dance on the 11th.  Sounds a bit tricky!
 We’ll be dark for Mid-Winter January 25th and hope to see you in Albany.
