 In November we celebrated Veterans Day with a dance where we honored Veterans with a free dance for those in attendance.  A great group of guys that served our country bravely.  A picture was taken and published in our newsletter. 
 We sadly lost two members in November, first Jeanne Evans a long time square dancer and member of Hoedowners and Eager Beavers.  Later in November we received sad news of the passing of long time member Jim Rogers.  He was in Seaside with many family members for their annual Thanksgiving week gathering.  Our hearts go out to Kay Rogers and the whole family.  Jim along with Kay have been actively involved in all aspects of Oregon Square dancing for about 30 years.  Jim will be missed and fondly remembered.   We look forward to January events including Mid Winter Festival in Albany. 
 Don't forget about TVC's annual potluck event January 27th at the IOOF Hall honoring club presidents past and present.  The TVC president will present the TVC's Recognition Award to a deserving couple or individual.  
 On Monday February 10th we start our afternoon Plus square dance lessons, noon to 1:15 pm.  Come to learn and/or refresh.  Our regular Plus dance is at 1:15 - 3:00 pm immediately after lessons.  Come enjoy our three great callers.  We dance "Every Monday Afternoon" at Sunset Presbyterian Church 14986 NW Cornell Rd. Beaverton, OR 97229.
