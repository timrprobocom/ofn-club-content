     December was a busy month for the Hoppers.  Thanks to the generosity of our members we had a very successful toy drive for the Vancouver Children’s Center.   Our lessons continued to be a lot of fun with the delightful and exuberant students who have been attending.  We plan to finish our second eight-week lesson session on December 30th with a new dancer dance designed to help the students become comfortable in a more traditional square dance format.  We have been very fortunate to have a large lesson group and some amazing and dedicated club angels who faithfully attend our lessons.

     On January 6, 2020 we will start our third eight-week session of lessons.  The anticipation of meeting new students and getting together with continuing students always feels sort of like the first day of a school year.  It’s an exciting experience!  This year we are planning to extend our lesson season through June in order to give students more dance experience.  

	The Hoppers will also be gearing up in January for Mid-Winter.  Traditionally a significant number of members have attended this great event.  It’s a perfect time to renew acquaintances with dancers we see only at special events as well as spending time with our own members.  We are looking forward to some terrific dancing to local and national callers and cuers as well as having a chance to shop at vendor booths and at the clothing resale.
