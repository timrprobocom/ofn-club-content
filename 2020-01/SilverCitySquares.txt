We have had some sad times the last couple of months in the loss of Mark Forster and Floyd Herigstad. They will both be greatly missed.

We do have our new dancer dance this month - come out and join us! Our baked potato dinner will be just before the dance - check out our flyer for more information.

We are starting some of our practices for competition this month and we are still fundraising. Please save the date of March 22 for our fundraising dance. Look for one of our youth at a dance or at Mid-Winter to get a teen festival pin or a raffle ticket. See you at a dance soon.
