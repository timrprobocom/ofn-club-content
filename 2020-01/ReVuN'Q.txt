Happy New Year to our dancing friends near and far. We are still reviewing previously learned rhythms and picking up steps that just did not work right the first time.

We spent December practicing on our music for the Showcase of Ideas. We will also be thinking about what rhythm to pick up next as we progress through things.

Hope to see a bunch of you in the Santiam Hall during Mid-Winter as we dance to the featured cuers and have a great time dancing. Marilyn Schmit
