Our next scheduled dance is February 29 (Leap Year!) at the dance center in Springfield.  The members of CCCA will call and cue a fun dance for you! The floor in our hall is cushioned and so nice to dance on.  The Eugene Opera is using our facility that day but will be finished in time for our CCCA meeting and dance.  Pre-Rounds are at 7:30PM and squares are from 8:00 - 10:00PM.  Put this on your 2020 calendars!

Roger Putzler and Christina Corelli will hold a New Year's Eve dance for only $2.50 a person.  At 8:30 we will have pre-rounds and at 9:00 mainstream and plus with rounds will start.  Please bring a pie if you wish. Callers and cuers who attend may call and/or cue a tip if they wish.  Bring your music!  We'll welcome in 2020! 

Keep on calling and cueing for fun,
Christina Corelli
CCCA Secretary
