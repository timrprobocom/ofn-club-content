Greetings from Yreka.

I begin this on a sad note. We recently learned that long time member Annie Blaylok has passed away. It is always difficult to get this kind of news. Thank you Elaine, Ron, and Francis for sending me this info.

We are planning our next party night to be held on Jan 16th at Evergreen Elementary School. Because of winter conditions, and travel concerns the dance will be 6:30 to 9:30 If we have enough Advanced dancers I will attempt a tip or two. This dance will be catered toward our new dancers. At this point they are the most active and most enthusiastic so we want them to join us experience a party night, welcome them into the club and meet other dancers. So bring a new dancer along!

Sherrie and I want to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year. We hope that this next year brings all of you good health and happiness.

Merry Christmas  !
