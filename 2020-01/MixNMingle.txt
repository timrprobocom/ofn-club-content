 M&M's said goodbye to 2019 at our annual Canned Food Drive Dance in Dec. It marked the end of yet another, fun year of dancing with our caller, Randy Dibble, cuer, Jeanine Norden and the many friends and guests who have joined us at the Winona Grange.  We look forward to ringing in a hello to 2020 with everyone at our January dances.
