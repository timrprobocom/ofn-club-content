title: Bachelor Beauts and Swinging Mountaineers
---
Recently, the Bachelor Beauts (mainstream) and Swinging Mountaineers (plus) in Central Oregon voted to become one club.  With longtime members aging out of the dancing community and volunteers weary of serving on multiple committees and boards, it was a practical decision.  Central Oregon's smaller population also translates into a smaller dance community, and combining the two Bend-based clubs will mean fewer board meetings and an elimination of duplicate leadership positions.  The two clubs become the High Desert Dancers as of January 1, 2020.  Mainstream dances continue on first and third Saturdays, and Plus dances will be held on 2nd and 4th Fridays.
