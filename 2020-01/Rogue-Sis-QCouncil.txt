Happy Holidays to all.  Rogue Sis Q Council met in December at Round Table Pizza.  Dances were finalized for the next year with callers and cuers from the Rogue Sis Q Callers and Cuers Association. 

The council has started a new activity for our new dancers from each club.  New dancers will be given dance cards from the home club.  The card will need to be signed and dated when attending a student level dance.   Each student must attend at least one student level dance at each of Rogue Sis Q Council clubs, one dance sponsored by Rogue Sis Q caller/cuer dance, and one council dance within a year to receive a dangle for participation.  Student dancers had a chance to get their first signature on December 15th at the Rogue Sis Q Caller/Cuers Midway dance.  The next council dance will be January 10th at the council sponsored Pajamarama dance; this could be signature number two

Encourage your students to attend the student level dances at Charlie Brown Squares, Circle N Squares, and Star Promenaders and get a signature.  Accompany your students to the dances.

Hope to see everyone at the Pajamarama dance in Grants Pass at the Josephine County Square Dance Center. All levels of square dancing, starting with Advanced squares and moving on to student level Mainstream and Plus.  Round dancers will have beginner level dancing too.  Richard Lane will be calling and Rikki Lobato cueing.  This should be a fun night to remember.  And, don't forget to wear your best pajamas.
