Kurt Jensen, one of our members, suffered a stroke late November.  His left side is affected.  He's been cracking up the hospital staff as his speech has not been affected.  He's maintained that dry sense of humor too.

Kurt's sister, Kris Jensen, extended her stay after Thanksgiving to be with her brother.  Kris was here to calls our annual Pre-Thanksgiving dance with potluck and silent auction. We had a small crowd, but everyone had a fabulous time, awesome potluck and sold some pretty cool items at the silent auction.  Kris always does an amazing job of calling.  One of our newer dancers was pleased that Kris could get her back to where she needed to be, and that she was watching the floor. Kurt will be going to rehab soon.  We are all hoping for complete recovery for Kurt so he can get back to dancing and doing the infamous "Swap around!"

An  update on Kurt Monday Dec. 2:  Kurt improved dramatically and was able to go home where he'll do some outpatient physical therapy instead of at rehab  We hope to see him in a square very soon!  That's the greatest news ever!  Good job Kurt!

Kurt and Lorna are angels for our Challenge - 1 class.  There are many calls at C-1, but it's taking a long time as the class is Sundays and not everyone can be there, especially during the holidays.  It's fun  nonetheless.  And yes, a challenge!

We dance almost every Sunday at the Emerald Dance Center in Springfield.  5:30 - 8:00.  We dance all levels.  Our caller, Tim Matteson, will adjust the levels according to who shows up to come and dance.  It's always FUN, and we always have a lot of FOOD!  We encourage all square dancers to join us!  The floor is cushioned and comfortable! We even have heat and air conditioning!

Please call Tim at 541-988-0399 or David at 541-520-7311 to make sure we are dancing.  We are dark once in a blue moon, but we'd hate to miss you.

Keep on dancing,
Christina Corelli
