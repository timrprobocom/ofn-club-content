We had some really good dances in November, one of which was called by Kris Jensen from Albuquerque, New Mexico.  She comes each year at Thanksgiving to spend the holiday with her mother, and her brother Kurt and his wife Lorna.  She does an awesome job calling advanced and workshopping some calls as necessary when she sees this is called for.  When we don’t have live callers like Nordbye and Jensen we dance to recorded callers, each one of whom are great and unique in this or her own way.  While I think most of us would wish to dance to a live caller, this cannot happen as we don’t have a caller in this area who can call advanced.  We are lucky that Dan is around in the summer and that Kris can come once in a while to visit her mother and brother.

We learned in late November that Kurt Jensen had suffered a stroke and was hospitalized for a few days.  He was expected to go to rehab from there for about a week.  His speech was unaffected but he did suffer some left side mobility problems.  We are hoping he can return to dancing as soon as possible.  We love his sense of humor and his general affability.

We dance normally about two Sundays a month.  Please check ur website at cas-sq.yolasite.com.  It might be best to call to be sure (541) 741-4149.  We dance in Hall B at the Emerald Square Dance Center at 20th and Yolanda in Springfield, OR.  Hall B is behind the main hall which fronts the street.  Please come join us for a fun time.
