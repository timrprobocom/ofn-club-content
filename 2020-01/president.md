Happy New Year to everyone!

I’m looking forward to a new year of dancing, seeing friends and having fun. I hope everyone else is doing so too. As we move into January, don’t forget to remind fellow dancers and don’t forget to tell new dancers/graduates about Mid-Winter Festival. Also – if you haven’t been for a couple of years, come join the fun this year. It’s in Albany January 24th-26th. This is a great opportunity to see old friends and make new ones from across the state. You can also get to dance to great callers and cuers both national level and ones from Oregon that you might not have danced to yet. There is a level of dance available for each dancer’s desire.

As our classes get close to graduation, please make sure that the new graduates continue to get out to dances. Don’t let them slip away quietly now that you might not see them every week. If you are going to a dance, call them up and invite them to join you there. Or if you have room, offer to pick them up.

Something to think about as we have new graduates or new club members join: they often want to get more involved in the work side of the club. Please don’t discourage this. There are a lot of ways to offer involvement that isn’t door or kitchen duty or one of the big officer positions in a club. Decorations committee ?  New faces often have new ideas and more hands make it go faster. Special theme dances?  Again, new ideas – can they come up with different ideas and how to make it work? Think outside the “box” and encourage new ideas.  Don’t just say “we don’t do it that way”. Granted, sometimes an idea just won’t work logistically, but think it through first and ask them how they think it would be possible. See if you can put a small group together to brainstorm an idea.

Many new dancers/club members/youth don’t know about dance break times and what/if they should bring something or even what type of item to bring. Give them something in writing to refer to or make a general announcement. Many people (yes even youth) love to bake and can bring cookies or brownies to a dance for break – if they know it would be welcome.

Have fun this month and I hope to see you at Mid-Winter Festival. If you need to catch me there – check out the youth table in the mainstream hall – if I’m not there the youth should know where I am or how to reach me.
