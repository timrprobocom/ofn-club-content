 Since the OFN is published around the 20th of December, you still have time to plan on the TVC's annual New Years Eve dance at the Hillsboro IOOF Hall.  Darrell Kalmbach and Sherri Clark will be calling and cueing the dance which will begin at 8:45 with pre-plus.  The dance will continue with Mainstream at 9:00 until 12:15 with every third tip plus.  
 The TVC fifth Saturday Dance, held at the Aloha Grange on November 30th was attended by 9+ squares of enthusiastic dancers.  Mike and Julie Stout were the featured caller and cuer and did a great job!  Julie Stiers added a round or two and Dan Nordbye called a plus tip.  The dance was co-hosted by our brand new club to the TVC, the Oak Hills Squares, who also took home the TVC banner for having the highest percentage of the club in attendance.
 The next Council event in January will be our annual TVC Presidents Meeting & Potluck to honor current and past club Presidents will be held at the IOOF Hall, 267 East Main Street, Hillsboro, OR 97123 on January27th.  The evening will begin with the potluck dinner starting at 6:00 followed by a meeting at 7:00.  All TVC club Presidents  & dancers are invited to join us.  The TVC wishes to thank all the presidents of the TVC Clubs for volunteering their time and efforts into this activity we all love.  Also, at this meeting the TVC President, Mike St Clair, will announce the recipient of the Tualatin Valley Council “Recognition Award” for outstanding service and special contribution to the square dance community within the TVC geographical area. 
 The next TVC dance will be the "Celebrate Winter Ending" on February 29th.  This dance will feature Adam Christman calling and Joyce Hooper cueing. Co hosted by the M 'n M's.  More details to follow.
