On December 27 and January 3, we will have the last of our B-48 dance workshops for new dancers.  These are off-dance nights for us, so see our flyer.  Also, note our Black and White Dance on January 15.

Remember, except for Christmas and New Years, we dance each Wednesday that the temperature is over 32 and under 90.
