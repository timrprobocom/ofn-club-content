 In November Oak Hills Squares did a demo and beginning lesson at the LDS Stake Center singles group in Lake Oswego.  What an energetic group!  We also did the Virginia Reel with about 50 people there.  A great time was had by all.
 On November 30th we co hosted the fifth Saturday TVC dance at the Aloha Grange.  This was a first for us and we all had a good time.  We also took home the TVC banner for having the highest percentage of their club in attendance.
 The ugly sweater dance on December 2nd was good fun, with all Christmas music, lots of goodies, and some really huge inflatables of Santa and a snowman.  Most sweaters were pretty rather than ugly, however.  The ‘experienced’ dance clothes brought in a good amount to benefit the club.  A contingent of Sunset Promenaders visited and received a banner.  Thanks for visiting!
 Our class graduation ceremony will be in January, since December is busy and we will be dark on December 30th.  A new dancers’ class will begin on February 10th.
 Please join TVC’s newest club on Mondays from 6:30 to 8:30.  The first Monday of the month is our theme dance and continues until 9:00, with mainstream dancing to all singing calls, and phase two rounds. Our January 6th dance will be a Trivia Dance.  Questions will be asked!  Prizes will be won! We hope you will join us!
 Happy Holidays!
