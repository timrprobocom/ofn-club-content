We are so proud of our class of Mainstream students and excited for them as they take their ever-developing square dancing skills to the New Dancer Dances and experience first-hand an early taste of the additional joy that square dancing has to offer beyond the lesson setting. Their energy, enthusiasm, positive attitude, and progress in dancing continue to make our Sunday evening lessons a real delight and make the New Dancer Dances especially gratifying. The students are eagerly (if somewhat apprehensively) looking forward to trying their wings at Mid-Winter in January.  We know that they will shine. The Salem Hospital venue is ideal, and we are so thankful to Salem Hospital for permitting us to offer our lessons there. Ongoing kudos to Membership Coordinators Dave O’Neill and Lee Ashwill! 

We feel good about our annual December service project. The proceeds from our successful Christmas Dance silent auction were donated to Windsor House, homes for brain injured adults. Every evening the Windsor House residents gather to review their day and enjoy a cup of decaf coffee -- brewed from cans of decaf coffee that IWW contributes every December. 

Come dance with us on the first and second Saturdays of each month at the Polk County Fairgrounds. Especially be sure that you mark your calendars for our special dances:  February 8 “Mix it up” Dance; March 8 (Sunday) IWW 60th Birthday Dance. 

Looking ahead: Mystery trip (date to be determined); Annual Koast Krash April 24 – 26 (Yachats Inn. Theme: At the Hop).  Dee Mackaman
