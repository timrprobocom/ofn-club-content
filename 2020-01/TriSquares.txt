 In November our Two-Step and Mainstream lessons continued, and we had a great “New Dancer Jamboree” on the 3rd.  On the 10th we attended the jamboree for Chaps ‘n Petticoats in Aurora.
 In January our lessons continue after the pause for the holidays.  We’ll have a special B51 dance on January 10th “The Cowboy B51 Festival” for all the students out there, called by Terry Halley and cued by Sandra Pinion.  No second dance in January, in honor of the MidWinter Festival in Albany.
