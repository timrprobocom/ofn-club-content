In November we had two really fun dances, both of them before Thanksgiving.  The 2nd Friday Nov. 8 had Jim Hattrick and Jackie Gale paired up, calling and cueing for us.  This dance did not have a theme.  It was held the night before the big Turkey Dance in Sweet Home the next night which might account for the relatively small turnout.  Hattrick always makes it fun and will do six couple squares or a square within a square to make it more interesting.

Ten Single Trees attended the Turkey Dance this year along with over 20 Whirl-A-Ways.  Whirl-A-Ways received a trophy for the club with the most members present.  The turkey dinner was good as always and the floor was jam-packed with enthusiastic dancers.  Jim and Jackie make a great pair and one can never get tired of dancing to their calling and cueing.  So good to see people return to this dance in droves.  Sure makes it a lot more fun.

On the 4th Friday, Nov. 22, we had Darrel Kalmbach call our dance for us.  We haven’t had Darrell down for a long time and he is as good as he ever was!  He kept us on our toes, really concentrating but still having a great time.  That night was our Western Hoedown and Chili Feed and some of our members really outdid themselves with the homemade chili and cornbread!  We returned to our former schedule to fit in a break for the chili feed, but we normally dance from 7:30 to 10:00 without a break since the change in September.

Come join us at the Emerald Square Dance Center at 20th and Yolanda in Springfield off I-105 in Hall A which fronts the street.  The hall is large with a wood, cushioned floor very easy on the feet.

Please come join us.  In January we only have the one dance January 10 with Jim Hattrick and Jackie Gale.  The 4th Friday we will be dark for Mid-Winter.  The Jan. 10 dance will be held at New Dancer level (Roger’s class will be well advanced by then).  This will be a Gospel Dance.
