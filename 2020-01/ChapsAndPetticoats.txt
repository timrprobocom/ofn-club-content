Another year has vanished, and each December I can hear Gr’ma saying “My how time flies.” 

Chaps and Petticoats celebrated the Christmas season with friends, food and enjoyed the “Left and Right” ornament-exchange game at our Club Christmas Party on December 15, 2019.  While the weather outside was frightful... our enjoyment was merry at the Maplewood Grange!  

Bachelor and Bachelorettes held their “new-dancer” B-48 Jamboree on Wednesday, December 11th at the Abernethy Grange with Jim Hattrick (caller & cuer).  Chaps had a square (4 Angels and 4 students) and a wonderful time dancing. Chaps new dancers experienced “progressive squares” for the first time and enjoyed it the most.  Moving through the hall was a fabulous way to meet other Clubs. their new dancers and dance with new partners!

On December 7th, we attended the Oaky Doaks “Christmas Memories” dance (Don Hart called and Julie Stiers cued).  Ee were just one dancer shy of a Visitation Banner.  Gee, I guess seven is not so lucky!  We helped make two squares and spirits bright though - after all, t’is the Christmas Season.

We were overjoyed by the nine squares (also two sitting out) attending our ‘new-dancer” Jamboree and “Turkey Trot” dinner on Sunday, November 24th.  Where else can you enjoy a full-trimmings turkey dinner and dance for only $6. Once our tummies were full, we danced it off with Scott Zinser's tips (“yes, Scott, we’d like to see that again”) and Mark MacDonald’s aerobic cueing.  Thanks to all who attended and shared our Thanksgiving.

Chaps and Petticoats will bring in the 2020 New Year with these January and February dances.  We hope our friends can help us fill the hall and make some new memories during these 1st and 3rd Friday dances:  
- Scott Zinser and Julie Stiers on January 3rd  (no particular theme) - opens with Plus 7:30pm,
- Leonard Snodgrass & Lonnie Sycks (will be razzing each other) on January 17th - Rounds open 7:30pm
- Scott Zinser (opens with Plus) & Randy Lewis cues for Chaps on February 7th, then 
- On FEB 21st: Darrell Kalmbach & Tami Helms will help us celebrate our Anniversary at the FLINTSTONE dance. 

Have a healthy & Happy New Year, everyone!  We look forward to seeing you at Mid-Winter 2020!!
