 November.  Even as the holiday season begins to ramp up and the nights are frosty and foggy,  dancers drive, some of them 45 minutes to an hour, to come to our dances.  In this month of thanksgiving in which we are grateful for our Veterans and celebrate the prosperity of our land, R Square D would like to honor our square dance community.  Many of you work behind the scenes caring for those menial tasks that keep our organization afloat and successful.  That is no small thing:  providing flyers, preparing the space for the dances, bringing food, keeping the beverages filled, cleaning up and all who dance,  a very heartfelt THANK YOU!
 "A Merry Christmas and Happy New Year". 
 Our new year will bring lessons January 8th.  Wednesday evenings at 6:30 pm for Plus, following our previous workshop/lesson format.  Beginning class starts at 7:30 with the first 2 lessons free for beginners!  This is a great way to start out the new year with dancing ahead and new friendships to develop for the future.
 The second Friday dance in January is the one in which we serve up soup to warm you up for coming out on a wintry night.  Mid Winter is the regional dance of the season, an opportunity to dance with those from far and wide.  On the 4th Saturday R Square D will be dark, but we will dance with you in Albany!

Looking forward to 2020 with you,
