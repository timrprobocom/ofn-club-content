 We had 70+ enthusiastic dancers come out for our new dancer's jamboree on December 6th.  It was a great time, with lots of festive red and green colors twirling around on the floor.
 With only 2 lessons remaining, the 4 students will be graduating before Christmas.  They are already joining us at our dances.
 The November canned food drive collected a large barrel of food for the needy in our area, thanks everyone who contributed.
 Our first dance is January 3rd, regular dance, and January 17th is a masquerade ball.  Looking forward to that one.
 Please join us as caller KC Curtis calls and Bev Flint cues.  See you soon.
