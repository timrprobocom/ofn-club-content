Our dances have been small, but we appreciate all those that have supported us. Larry Dupray, who passed away about 1 year ago , left his square dance equipment to his daughter who generously  donated it to the club. We just sold the equipment and will be able to continue our club for awhile longer.  We have fun dances with Sandy Harris calling on the 1st Saturdays of the month and Lennie Ludiker will call most of the 4th Saturdays with 

Janet Geiger filling in for him when needed. Christina Corelli cues for both dances.

Lennie Ludiker's mother passed in late November; our thoughts are with him.
