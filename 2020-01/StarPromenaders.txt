Don’t forget July at Diamond Lake in 2020. We will have a real “TRIFECTA” and a bonus with three callers of National Status. We will have Mike Sikorsky, Michael Kellogg and Mike Haworth, with the bonus of Rikki Lobato at the featured cuer.

Come out and join us on January 3rd for the next Game Night. The theme for this one will be “Cold Weather Comfort Food.” It is a “Hoot.” If you don’t play Mexican Train, there is usually a game of cribbage going on. We are open to most any table game. In fact, there was another game being played at the last “Game Night” besides Mexican Train and Cribbage.

Classes are going well and the students are really enthusiastic.

The Stars are once again collecting stuffed animals for the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department to give to children in distress. Last year we collected and donated 200+ animals. I think we can do better. There is a tote on the stage at the Rogue Valley Square Dance Center to put the animals in. PLEASE HELP!!

We are again going to sponsor the Alzheimer’s Benefit Dance. It will be Sunday, June 7, 2020 from 2 to 5pm. This is a very worthy cause and hits home to a lot of us in the square dance world. All proceeds will go to Alzheimer Research. The Callers & Cuers are donating their time and the Stars are donating the hall. A challenge has been issued. Last year we raised $520+ and the challenge is to double that; at the very least.

On December 19th the Stars’ Class held their Christmas Potluck. Besides the Potluck Dinner (which was free), there was a White Elephant Gift Exchange. Of course, there was dancing around the Christmas Tree.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO EVERYONE

See you in a square.
