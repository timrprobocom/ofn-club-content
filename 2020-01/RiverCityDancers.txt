We hope you all had a happy holiday season and that the new year is good to you.  It is with deep sadness that I report the sudden passing on December 12 of our dear member Gail Domine. Gail will be remembered and missed by many of us for both her friendship and contribution to the square dance community. Gail along with her partner Al Wolf were recipients of the Randall Award for their service to square dancing. She is greatly missed.

In December our club was very active.  We had a club visitation to Tumbleweeds on December 6 and then that same evening had another visitation to the Toe Draggers New Dancers Jamboree.  We brought some of our students. It was a fun day and evening of dancing.  On December 11 we had our annual holiday dinner and of course our two club dances that month.

In addition to our two club dances in January (which are held the second and third Saturday), we will host the PAC dance at our hall January 31.  Many of us are also planning to attend Mid-Winter in Albany January 23, 24, 25. 

Happy Dancing.
Carol Mendenhall
