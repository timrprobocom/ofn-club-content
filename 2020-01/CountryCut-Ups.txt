Happy New Year! The Cut-Ups will have our usual first Saturday dance, but will be dark for 4th Saturday and we’ll see you all at Mid-Winter in Albany.

We have a great Mainstream class going and will be doing a second Jamboree on Sunday, January 5th from 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM with Scott Zinser and Tami Helms, and hopefully some guest callers. Floor time is so important to getting these new dancers ready to join us at regular dances. Come bring your new students or just come as an angel to support the new dancers.

Set the date aside for Sunday, March 8, 2020! The next Murder Mystery Play and Dance will be performed at the Boring Barn! The play this year will be titled, “The Wanderer,” and will again be performed by the Crazy 8 Players. Tickets will go on sale by Mid-Winter.
