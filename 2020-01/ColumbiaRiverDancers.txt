 What might be better than dancing in your slippers, you ask.  How about dancing in your stockings.  Yep.  The Columbia River Dancers will be having an old time sock hop.  So, find a really scruffy pair of socks and head over to the Hazel Dell Grange on the 11th of January to join Craig Abercrombie and Julie Stiers when they turn back the clock for a rocking good time. 
 The club has chosen to support the Mid-Winter festival on January 25th and will be dark so we can attend the annual event.
 We did not have our Burn-Off dance in November since Thanksgiving was so late.  Look out though for next year.
 Happy new year.
