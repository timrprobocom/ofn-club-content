What an absolutely fabulous 52nd birthday dance we had!!!!  Michael Haworth called an exceptionally fun and challenging dance; starting with Advanced and continuing with Mainstream and Plus the rest of the night!! We had a floor full of round dancers all nite with Rikki Lobato cueing. Most everyone stayed til' the last tip. Thank you to ALL of our visitors!! What a treat it will be to dance to Michael Haworth again at Diamond Lake 2020.
