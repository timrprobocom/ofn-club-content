Willamette Squares met in November for our regular dance, our Cornucopia Dance. There was a cornucopia of dancers and food, and as usual, everyone enjoyed the festivities.

On December 1, we hosted a new dancers’ dance. As many as 100 people signed in so we had a great crowd. The majority of the time there were eight squares on the dance floor. In addition, we held a used clothing sale. The clothing was priced to sell so everything was a bargain. We didn’t make that much money, but it was worth making square dance attire affordable and to see the faces of new dancers light up when they found an item of clothing that not only fit but would have them dancing in style! The new dancers were awesome, so full of enthusiasm and fun loving! They got to experience a variety of callers and why square dancers refer to square dancing as “friendship set to music!”

Willamette Squares wishes everyone great dancing in the New Year! Jodee
